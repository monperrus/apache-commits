   "Instead of verifying the pristine copy of a file before updating it,", 
   "calculate and verify the used text base (base/revert/copied) stream while", 
   "applying the delta using the new stream checksum api. It also enables the", 
   "verification of files where the workingcopy has no recorded checksum.", 
   "Justification:", 
   "This allows verifying and updating pristine files in a single pass, where", 
   "we used two separate passes over the pristine file before.", 
   "This enhances update performance on large files and most likely reduces", 
   "the amount of work on-access virusscanners do on our files.", 
   "Notes:", 
   "r36389 contains the actual change. r36412 is a code cleanup patch.", 
   "r36421,r36423 re-enable checking pristine files when apply_textdelta", 
   "doesn't send a base checksum. (neon and serf before r36422).",
