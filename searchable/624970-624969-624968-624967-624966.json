   "We now have basic web unit tests, courtesy of the integration of JWebUnit into build.xml and tests/etc/webtests.xml. Four jars were added to the 'lib' dir for testing. Web unit testing simulates a browser's experience and verifies that the following test cases run properly:", 
   "- Anonymous viewing (Main and About pages)", 
   "- Setting asserted name via cookies", 
   "- Creating user profiles", 
   "- Logging in to JSPWiki using a password", 
   "Four combinations are explicitly tested: custom and container authentication, each of these with both the XML and JDBC user database types. Note to developers: the Ant task \"webtests\" should be part of your test plan. Learn, love and embrace JWebUnit. It's easy to express test cases with it, and we will (no doubt) be creating more test cases as we go... see examples in package com.ecyrd.jspwiki.web."
