   "In this change:", 
   "- new iterative algorithm for fitting transformed Path, Ellipse, Rounded Rect", 
   "- tweaked iterative algorithm for fitting non-transformed Path with miter limit", 
   "- fixes to calculating the bounding box of a rounded rect when radiusX != radiusY", 
   "- fix to MatrixUtil.fitBounds to take explicits into account in the case where both dimensions are specified", 
   "- fix to MatrixUtil to properly return null when no solution exists for 45 degree rotated elements when trying to fit in both dimensions", 
   "- fix to MatrixUtil to take explicit settings into account when relaxing constraints while trying to fit an element in both dimensions", 
   "- added min/max properties to SpriteVisualElement", 
   "- fix GraphicElement to avoid extra layout pass when dealing with transformations (looks like extra invalidation was added with the mirroring infrastrucutre)",

   "Fix for rotation issues with explicit width and explicit height for Catalyst. The issue is that when we try to solve width and height such that the post transform bounds satisfy the layout constraints, we only took into account the measured width/height even when there was an explicit size specified. In the case of rotation, it is possible at times to use the explicit width/height to find a fit. Thus, the fix is to try to find a solution first using the explicit size. If no solution exists, then we relax the constraint on the size and try to find other solutions.",
