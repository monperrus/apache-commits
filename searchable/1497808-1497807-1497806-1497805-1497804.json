   "fix for STANBOL-1130: The comparator now uses the hashcode of the actual bNode instance and checks for equality in case the hashcode is the same. In case of hashcode conflics (same hashcode, but not equals) the System.identityHashcode is used for sorting. Only if this is also the same, the conflict is resolved by memorising the sorting in a confictsMap. Before the identityHashcode was used from the beginning and by that causing the issue reported by this issue."
