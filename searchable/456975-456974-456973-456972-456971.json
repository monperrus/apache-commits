   "<wicket:param>. I basically added test cases which should work if everything were fine, but they don't and thus are currently disabled. It is meant to be starting point (test driven development) for future improvement on <wicket:param>. Please see my email for more details. I guess the current implementation is more or less useless for the use cases we try to solve. My current feeling is that we need to make changes to wicket core process steps to really solve it (and the related autoAdd issue). I'll prepare an email with my suggestion to the development team."

   "finished work on wicket namespaces. It is now possible to have different wicket namespaces within your application. Wicket namespace is now determined per markup file. It can be set similiar to the xhtml way either by xmlns:wicket or xmlns:wicket=\"http://wicket.sourceforge.net\". You'll need the latter one in case your xhtml markup requires more than just one additional namespace. http://wicket.sourceforge.net\" will be used to determine that this is the wicket namespace."
