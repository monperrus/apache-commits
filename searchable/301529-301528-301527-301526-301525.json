   "Few changes to improve the mbean registration ( and unregistration ).", 
   "There are 2 scenarios I want to support: the current one, where components are", 
   "added/removed using internal APIs. And a JMX one, where components are created", 
   "by via JMX, and they insert themself in the running system ( for example the", 
   "admin interface creates a new connector Mbean and starts it ).", 
   "The big change is that the JMX handling is now in the component itself -", 
   "each component will be aware if its JMX identity and will take care of registering", 
   "and unregistering the childs. While this removes some of the flexibility", 
   "( i.e. JMX will be deep inside, instead of a listener ), I think the code", 
   "will be cleaner and we'll gain some other fexibilities."
