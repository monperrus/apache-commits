   "[JIRA CXF-139] Server-side recovery.", 
   "System test with client surviving server crash and receiving asynchronous response from restarted Server.", 
   "Note that for the resent response to actually make it back to the client (execution of callback or availability in Response object) the server MUST use the same WSA-MessageID for the resent response (cf. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-352).", 
   "Client silently (logging a WARNING) discards second and all following responses (aborts the interceptor chain) so in that case a violation of the AtMostOnce delivery assurance cannot be reported. This is necessary because a) correlation is only possibly once and b) most interceptors are not capable to deal with the temporary exchange object (the exchange that is associated with the message if no correlation takes place).", 
   "Fixed threading issues in transactional store (connection and statements are shared)."
