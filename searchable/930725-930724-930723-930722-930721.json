   "- Simplified the SourceElement class hierarchy to a single class SourceElement, since the only implementation will be used all the time anyway, so having a set of interfaces only complicates the code.", 
   "- Removed the methods from SourceElement in which the parents and children can be modified. Instead, modifications should occur directly on the Lists obtained by getParents() and getChildren().", 
   "- SourceElement now checks that a certain SourceElement can only be added once to the List of SourceElements."
