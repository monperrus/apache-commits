   "New test which allows tests, written in ECMAScript, to be integrated in our test infrastructure. Tests need to run in response to the document's 'onload' event and report their result in a <testResult> element (and children <errorDescriptionEntry>) metadata. That metadata should be in the name space 'http://xml.apache.org/batik/test' to be usable by the infrastructure. See test-resources/org/apache/batik/css/dom/rgbTest.svg for an example (and related test-resources/org/apache/batik/css/dom/unitTesting.xml file)"
