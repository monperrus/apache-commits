   "OFBIZ-2259:  Implemented test data rollback per test-suite using the GenericDelegator", 
   "Provides the following benefits:", 
   "1. Test data independence per component suite", 
   "2. Ability to run tests repeatedly without reloading the database", 
   "3. Continued database independence for the testing tools", 
   "4. The possibility of future improvements for controlling when data is rolled back (per unit test, group of unit tests within a suite or", 
   "even tree structured tests where data is partially rolled back before continuing)", 
   "5. The future possibility to export data changes resulting from a test run", 
   "6. The future possibility to verify a test result automatically based on the output of #4", 
   "The rollback currently doesn't catch changes resulting from async service calls and also doesn't rollback changes to SequenceValueItem"
