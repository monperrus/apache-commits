This is done by modifying annotation processing to generate manifest fragments for each control processed, and the creation of a new ant task (org.apache.beehive.controls.runtime.packaging.ControlJarTask) that derives from the standard Ant Jar task and will roll the manifest fragments up and write them to the created/updated manifest for the jar.",
