   "o During addPlugin() only the plugin's artifact is resolved/added...just enough to get the plugin container to discover the pluginDescriptor.", 
   "o During getConfiguredMojo(), the rest of the plugin's artifacts will be transitively resolved and added to the plugin container (if this hasn't already been done). The deciding factor for attempting to complete the plugin container's artifact list is whether the only artifact in the pluginDescriptor's artifact list is the plugin artifact itself. If that makes sense.", 
   "It's a bit of black magic, but I think it'll work unless/until we find something more elegant. I'm abusing the container a little bit here, so it might be sensitive to plexus changes in future."
