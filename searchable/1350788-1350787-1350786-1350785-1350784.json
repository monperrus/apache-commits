   "Add ability to generate FlexComponentKit.MXP.  It will only do so if you have installed the Adobe Extension Manager and set an environment variable ADOBE_EXTENSION_MANAGER to point to it.  Most folks will not need it in daily building of stuff.  Release managers will need it if we need to update the FlexComponentKit because some underlying dependency gets changed."
