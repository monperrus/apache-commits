   "Cleaning up how virtualization works.  Getting rid of an extra validateNow() and a setLayoutBoundsSize(0,0) call.  Now when grabbing a virtual item renderer, we just \"bring it up to speed\" in that we are in the middle of an updateDisplayList() pass, so we force it to validateProperties() and validateSize().  It'll just validateDisplayList() naturally as part of the natural LayoutManager pass that it's already in the middle of.", 
   "The main performance boost comes from removing the setLayoutBoundsSize(0,0) call, which was already made in the justify layout case, so we shouldn't see a huge difference in Mobile performance; however, we should see a performance boost for scrolling virtual lists in general because of this.",
