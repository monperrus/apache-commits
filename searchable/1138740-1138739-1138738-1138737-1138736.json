   "The maven release plugin is real picky. Having the scm parameters configured in the common parent pom confused the generation of the scm.url during the release:prepare. The scm parameters were simply moved from core/pom.xml to pom.xml. Unfortunately this can't be fully tested until it is committed as the release:prepare goal bails unless everything is commited in the current check out. It does however get far enough to see that the scm.url in the release.properties is corrected."
