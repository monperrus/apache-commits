   "OPENJPA-70. Added new RemoteCommitEvent payload type and logic to fire RemoteCommitEvents when stale records are detected. This logic still gets fired via afterCommit(), even though these checks can happen either after a commit or a flush is issued. Additionally, these events are only fired against local listeners, so actually represent local analysis that is detecting remote events, rather than remote events themselves."
