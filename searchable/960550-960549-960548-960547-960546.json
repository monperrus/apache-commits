   "QPID-2681 : Provide ability to merge configurations. This does simple merging of sub configuration elements. Currently the last value to be merged is taken as is. No explicit merging is performed. Merging is performed in the order Queues->(Exchange)->Queue, Where a configured Exchange Configuration component can decide how to perform its merge. TopicConfiguration performs the order Topics->Topic->Subscriptions, this allows Global Topic configuration to be overwritten by a specific topic version. Currently the Topic is only identified by a straight string wild card matching has not yet been implemented."
