   "AXIOM-119: Always preserve the order of attachments (which was already the default behavior since r785554). There is no use case where the pre-r785554 behavior (i.e. sorting attachments by content ID) would be mandatory [1], and removing support for this frees us from the constraint of maintaining two collections with different orders in the Attachments class.", 
   "[1] XOP explicitly specifies that the order of MIME parts is irrelevant. The same should be true for SwA messages using swaRef. Finally, for services described using the WSDL MIME binding, preserving the order of attachments is mandatory."
