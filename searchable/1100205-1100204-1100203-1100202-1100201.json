   "I wondered if I should not remove the event from the common-controller since I guess this is rarely used. But, as the functionality is available OOTB, I preferred to keep it as is. So I simply remove the never-cache from  UserLoginAndProtectedView view-entity. Since it will almost always be empty, no memory issues and better performance are expected. If I remember well, at the moment I committed this, I checked: the performance impact was already not noticeable (most of the time only one check in the event).",
