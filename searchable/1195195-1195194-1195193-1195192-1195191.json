   "Refactored several of the methods from \"SharedDataHelper\", \"PropertiesController\" and \"ParticipantsController\" into a single model facade class, SharedContext, encapsulating the concerns of participants and shared data. As well as removing some odd dependencies (e.g. between controllers) and a further abstraction from the persistence layer, this provides a means for handling storage of shared data differently from other types of data (e.g. using nosql and/or cloud storage) and I think makes it a bit easier to understand the Wookie domain model."
