   "The main package was choking on the '&' because it was not escaped.  The dot-net-tools targets can now copy the html generated docs to ~/trunk/bin/docs/site folder when a release is generated by a nighty build. The 'coverage' command now generates the xml & html test reports from gallio along with the ncover reports. We no longer have to run tests twice which is a time suck when the tests for core take 40 minutes to run just a single pass."
