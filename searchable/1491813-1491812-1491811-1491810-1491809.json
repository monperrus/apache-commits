   "[UIMA-2636] commit the changes in boilerplate for this.  Changes: move features.properties to top level, remove the uima-eclipse-user-agreement (in .txt form) at the top level because it's now embedded in feature.properties, and remove the copies of these in src/main/resources, since the current strategy is to manually copy and edit where needed the features.properties and the uima-eclipse-user-agreement.html files to each individual Eclipse feature project."
