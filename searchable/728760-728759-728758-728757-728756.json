   "THRIFT-208. Fix ax_java.m4 for Ubuntu 8.10", 
   "On Ubuntu 8.10, /bin/sh is a symlink to dash (a minimal", 
   "Bourne-compatible shell).  ./configure is smart enough", 
   "to detect when the shell it is run with is missing features.", 
   "In such cases, it switches to a more capable shell (like bash).", 
   "This causes it to enable certain shell constructs that are", 
   "not supported by dash.  However, the Autoconf macro file that", 
   "we use to detect Java support interacts poorly with Autoconf", 
   "because it uses divert(-1) for large comments.  This somehow", 
   "causes configure to set SHELL to /bin/sh.  As a result, the", 
   "libtool script generated during the build process is not", 
   "compatible with the shell that is used to run it (if a recent", 
   "version of libtool is in use).", 
   "This change replaces all of the \"divert(-1)\" comments", 
   "with more traditional \"dnl\" comments.  This allows Thrift", 
   "to build on Ubuntu 8.10."
