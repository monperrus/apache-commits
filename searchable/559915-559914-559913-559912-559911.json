   "first pass at fixing up task running issues (ROL-1294, ROL-1446).  This commit introduces a couple significant changes to the way scheduled tasks are handled ...", 
   "1. Tasks are no longer scheduled using a ScheduledExecutorService in the thread manager impl.  We have replaced that functionality by implementing a custom TaskScheduler class with runs on its own thread and executes the scheduled tasks.  This was done to work around some inconsistencies with using ScheduledExecutorService as well as to implement some behavior specific to the way Weblogger tasks are run.", 
   "2. We have corrected for an issue with tasks missing appropriate execution times due to time drifting and clock mismatch issues created by the leasing process.  The has been fixed by updating the leasing logic so that it no longer has any affiliation with trying to prevent tasks from running before their set interval time and by using the custom scheduler in #1 to better synchronize the scheduled runtimes for tasks."
