   "Fixed bug in ChunkyByteArray that was being manifested by", 
   "parsing large UTF-16 files. The ChunkyByteArray holds", 
   "character data for the readers. This data is stored in an", 
   "array of chunks. No checks were in the code to resize the", 
   "array of chunks when needed. Therefore, large files would", 
   "expose this bug -- files larger than 64 * 16K.", 
   "REVISIT: So this brings up the question about whether we", 
   "need to hold onto *all* of the chunks in the byte array.", 
   "It may be possible to reuse only one chunk. This should", 
   "be looked at again after the upcoming release."
