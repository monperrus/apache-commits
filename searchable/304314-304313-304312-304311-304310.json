   "Few fixes to make \"ant build\" work without the slow \"deploy\" target first.",

   "Added an \"embed\" target for a minimal, embedable tomcat5.", 
   "Some of the components can be removed ( I'll need to document the deps and features implemented by", 
   "each component ) - right now it's 2.4 M.", 
   "Catalina.jar is almost 800k - it should be splited in \"core+required components\" and", 
   "few modules for the optional stuff ( like some valves, etc ).", 
   "Next is jasper-compiler, which is not required if precompiled jsps are used ( i.e. in", 
   "production servers or embeded apps ).", 
   "Digester,beanutils will also become optional if we finish serialization of the", 
   "Context ( that would greatly improve the startup time - and will allow \"pre-processed\" apps", 
   "that don't need to parse web.xml at startup ).", 
   "Regarding the (sample) scripts - each is a variation on JMX mbeans, the ant script", 
   "is working, I'll also try a standard MLET and a jboss-style services ( that will also", 
   "work with commons-modeler ).",
