   "Bug - Create (upload) content in Party Profile does not work (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4179). The bug occurs when trying to upload a zip file. Tika was missing a class for dealing with zip files. I added commons-compress-1.1.jar. I also updated the UX for the upload function. When no file purpose was set the upload crashes. Therefore i added a field validation.",
