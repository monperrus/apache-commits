   "Switching out the old video component for the new video component that uses OSMF.  Also fixing RSL issue with OSMF because a change in flex-config.xml accidentally got overwritten.  Also fixing a bug caught during the last code review where you would set the volume on the VideoPlayer, but the volumeBar wouldn't be made aware of that change.", 
   "Switching out the video component results in *many* API changes.  The changes are highlighted below:",

   "- spark.components.mediaClasses.StreamingVideoSource is renamed to park.components.mediaClasses.DynamicStreamingVideoSource",

   "- maintainAspectRatio:Boolean has been renamed to scaleMode:String and rather than true/false, it now access 4 values: none, zoom, letterbox, and stretch.  See the enum class org.osmf.display.ScaleMode.", 
   "- playheadTime:Number has been renamed to currentTime:Number", 
   "- playWhenHidden has been renamed to pauseWhenHidden, and it's \"tense\" has been reversed.  So playWhenHidden = true correlates to pauseWhenHidden = false.  Also, before we would only pause when the video component was explcitly set to visible=false, but now we detect if the video components or any of it's ancestors have been hidden.",

   "- seekToFirstFrame:Boolean (pending PARB approval) - This is a new property available on VideoDisplay/VideoPlayer.  When autoPlay = false, if seekToFirstFrame is set to true, then we will connect to the server to start downloading the video, figure out the size of the video and resize appropriately, and show the first frame of the video.  If seekToFirstFrame is false, then no connection to the server is made, there's no implicit size for this video, and the first frame will not be show automatically.  By default the value of this property is true.  In the old video component, when autoPlay = false, we always has the same behavior as seekToFirstFrame = true.  Now it is controllable through this property.  Eventually, (not for Flex 4.0), we will most-likely have support for a thumbnail source or a splash screen so the video's preview will show up without making an unneeded connection to the server.  The property name may change depending on PARB.",
