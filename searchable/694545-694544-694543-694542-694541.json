   "and surefire will attempt to compile any *Test*.java files - which will fail since they are not in the correct location", 
   "relative to their package declaration.  See http://www.nabble.com/Plugins%3A-execution-configuration-does-not-add-to-configuration-td19425025.html",

   "Changed compareDirectoryContent to no longer accept a directory to use as check contents.",

   "of this directory are used in the comparison processes. This has simplified checking in", 
   "code as you no longer need to specify additional calls for multiple directories and", 
   "made it easier to support multi-module checking as previously only ${basedir}/expected",
