   "Merge revision 14996 from 4.x to trunk.", 
   "Update for implementing ILayoutDirectionElement in BitmapAsset and SpriteAsset. Instead of trying to handle transforming the assets directly, we leverage AdvancedLayoutFeatures to update the transform matrix of the assets. The main difference between the asset implementations and other ones is that width/height and scaleX/Y are tied to each other. The setters of each of those properties will set the backing value of their respective property. Another change is that we use the existence of layoutFeatures to keep track of whether the asset needs to de-mirror instead of using the mirror variable.", 
   "Also, I removed a FIXME from AdvancedLayoutFeatures. We already short-circuit this in the classes that own the AdvancedLayoutFeatures. I changed the FIXMEs for the x getters to TODOs.",

   "Fixed various effects bugs.", 
   "23236: Easing was being ignored for properties being auto-animated (basically, the post-layout transform center). This caused a mis-match between a resizing animation and a move animation, causing the object to swim back and forth as the easing on these animations were out of sync. This also fixes the high-priority 23856 bug, which was closed as a dup of 23236.", 
   "23421: There is a player bug related to a null concatenatedMatrix property on DisplayObjects which causes a mis-calculation of mouse hit testing when the matrix is changed too late in the frame cycle. Since we do not validate our properties until enterFrame or render time, this sometimes causes Flash to detect mouseOut on objects that the mouse is still over when the object goes in and out of 3D in that frame. This fix works around that player bug by forcing matrix validation early when we detect a 2D/3D switch.", 
   "23484: The transform code in AdvancedLayoutFeatures needed to account for stretchX/stretchY when using computedMatrix and computedMatrix3D. These matrices assume pre-stretched values. Since our transforms expect post-stretched values, they need to divide out the stretchX/Y values before using these matrices.",
