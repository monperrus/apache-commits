   "Patched Betwixt to be able to properly default Digester rules auto-detecting addFoo(Foo) methods. This means that Betwixt can now bidirectionally turn the RSS example beans into XML and parse it back into beans. I've added round tripping JUnit test cases to ensure that Betwixt behaves like the RSSDigester example as well as that round tripping to XML then beans doesn't loose any information. Also updated the documentation somewhat to describe the addFoo() method naming conventions. Also removed the TODO.txt as the updated STATUS.html now contains a complete list of things to do. Finally some release notes have been added to CVS."
