   "Implement a <path/> output and a <includes/> output that allow projects to export 'native' style stuff. Add a 'jdk' installed package to vmgump.xml using that new functionality. Ain't it cool how easy that was? This is the first step to Gump compiling a jdk to use for compiling other stuff (eg, bootstrapping kaffe), or towards gump compiling python to run itself :-)"

   "Fixing issues related to MNG-377, where the plugins.xml metadata was being mishandled. Separated updating of this metadata into a separate mojo, bound to the 'package' phase, and put in a validator for the POM (POM has to have distributionRepository now for maven-plugin's) which is bound to the 'validate' phase. Put together an integration test that uses modello:java as a case where the pluginGroups must be consulted. Also had to change the Verifier to check a verifier.properties for failOnErrorOutput, which will suppress IT failures based on [ERROR] log output (modello outputs one of these, and kills the IT unnecessarily).", 
   "MNG-377 should be resolved at this point."
