   "bug 3251: for things like sa-learn, the bayes db gets locked, then a bunch of learning occurs, then the db is unlocked.  however, if the learning takes more than 600 seconds (10 mins), another process would see the lock as stale and break it, even though the original process is still going.  now, everytime a lock is requested (which is still per message), the lock file will be 'refreshed' via utime()."
