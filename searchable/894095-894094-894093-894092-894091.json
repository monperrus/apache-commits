   "Alter the multi-file testsuite to use classpath lookup instead of source reference. This make tests work out of the box in a maven imported eclipse (multiple module in single project) while keeping the behaviour in standard maven. Also this is much better as it does not references the source location for files while refers it using the final test-classes package name."
