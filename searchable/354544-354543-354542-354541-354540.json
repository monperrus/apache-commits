   "Submitted By: Edwin Punzalan", 
   "Reviewed By: John Casey", 
   "Applied patches, with minor changes.", 
   "These patches will ensure that the optional flag is passed on and inherited correctly when dealing with managed dependencies.", 
   "I changed the patches, in that I added a new createDependencyArtifact(..) method on ArtifactFactory, which will eliminate the need to call an older variant of the method by passing in a null value for the inheritedScope parameter."
