   "Enable easier styling and customization of DataGrid skin parts. Replaced IGridRowBackground with IGridVisualElement. A DataGrid skin part that implements IGridVisualElement will have its prepareGridVisualElement() method called before its layed out. This allows us create skin parts that can pull styles from DataGrid when created. Users can also have their skin parts implement IGridVisualElement to customize their skin part before beign layed out.", 
   "Also added the following styles to DataGrid: caretColor, rollOverColor, selectionColor, and symbolColor. Many of the skin parts in the default skin implement IGridVisualElement to enable these styles. Added default caretColor to defaults.css of #0167FF.",
