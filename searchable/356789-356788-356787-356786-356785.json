   "Due to various memory leaks and occasional data corruption, I have modified the xsd__base64Binary and xsd__hexBinary objects.", 
   "This has resulted in some API changes, including the encapsulation of member data and provision of appropriate get/set methods.", 
   "I also took the opportunity to provide an '=' operator, which allows the generated code to be identical to that of any other xsd simple type.", 
   "I have modified all the test cases affected by this change to reflect the updated API, and have added one new test (XSD_base64BinaryTestValidData) case, to ensure data corruption doesn't occur."
