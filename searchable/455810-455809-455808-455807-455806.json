   "Restructured class hierarchy for converters a little so that all integral converters such as IntegerConverter extend AbstractIntegerConverter.   Then made getNumberFormat() in AbstractNumberConverter abstract and implemented it in AbstractIntegerConverter by creating an integer NumberFormat instance and then turning grouping off and integer-only on.  I like this fix because it really respects i18n, which is sometimes very complex stuff."
