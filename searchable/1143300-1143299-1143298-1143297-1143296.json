   "The getRequests() method of the request logger doesn't work at all. It returns a synchronized list which is wrapped in a unmodifiable list. The contents of the list is linked list, so whenever you are iterating over the unmodifiable list, the request logger is updating the underlying linked list\u2014causing ConcurrentModificationExceptions.", 
   "Worked around this by using a rounded buffer in the request logger instead of the linked list. This implementation brings improved statistics to the request logger, such as average request times across the monitored interval.",
