   "- Switch implementation of Java2WSDL to the one based on AxisService.", 
   "- Add the wsdl generated by the service attached in AXIS2-2744 as another test case (for complicated schemas)", 
   "- Move both the BaseTypes and ComplexTypes to integration as it needs the adb module too (since RPC MR's are located in that module)", 
   "- Add a new createService method that takes in a SchemaGenerator that can be used from Java2WSDL", 
   "- cleanup typo in method name (addExclueMethods -> addExcludeMethods)", 
   "- Add a hook to set the EPR from outside (if use specifies it in java2wsdl command line)", 
   "TODO's:", 
   "- Figure out how to set the style, use;", 
   "- Add a Switch for WSDL20"
