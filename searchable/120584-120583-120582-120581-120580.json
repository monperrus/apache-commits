   "o made the default MAVEN_HOME_LOCAL be ${user.home}/.maven instead of MAVEN_HOME if MAVEN_HOME_LOCAL was not specified.",

   "o fixed typo in patch unpakcedPluginDir to unpackedPluginDir where appropriate", 
   "o added a bit more logging", 
   "o corrected provided logging by checking isInfoEnabled() and isDebugEnabled() before logging", 
   "o fixed MAVEN_HOME_LOCAL path for cygwin in 'maven' script. Otherwise the patch caused exceptions to get thrown", 
   "o :chkMLocalHome in maven.bat removed cause the default is set in driver.properties. Good thing too as labels can only be eight characters on win98/me I believe", 
   "o adjusted the build-bootstrap.xml to copy phase-1 install to maven.home.local", 
   "o in 'maven' and 'maven.bat' only pass maven.home.local to maven executable if it is defined", 
   "o removing trailing line endings in a few places"
