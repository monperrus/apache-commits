   "Applied SHINDIG-159 with some minor changes. Also improved Guice injection points to allow for better optional injection when specialization is not needed. This required using method injection in addition to ctor injection. It's a little verbose, but it solves the problem nicely.", 
   "The oauth support here is not yet complete; I've wired it up to be used, but it'll only work for the gadgets pre-authorized in the oauth.json file.", 
   "The oauth code is also not very well wired for Guice. It works, but it could use some improvement."
