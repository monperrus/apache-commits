   "OPENJPA-2442.  Just using ProxyConcurrentMaps for proxying the Map methods.  Since this extends ProxyMaps anyway, this is pretty safe change.  This change resolves the TestProxyManager errors in openjpa-kernel when testing with Java 8 runtime.  And, it doesn't affect Java 7 runtime at all.  Refer to the Comments section for more details."
