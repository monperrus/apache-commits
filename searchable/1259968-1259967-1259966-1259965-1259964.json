   "Recommit fix for http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-25919. For a non-mirroring application, we were calling invalidateLayoutDirection at startup even though we start out with the right layout. The fix is to default oldLayoutDirection to \"ltr\" so that we skip some of these calls at start up. We also need to make oldLayoutDirection mx_internal so that subclasses that don't call super.validateDisplayList() can update oldLayoutDirection correctly.",

   "There is both a style and property called layoutDirection in UIComponent. For UIComponent, both Hans and I agree that we should promote the use of the style. I added an exclude for the layoutDirection property in UIComponent. This allows code hinting for the layoutDirection style in the CSS style declaration. It also removes the layoutDirection property from the ASDoc. Code hinting still works for the layoutDirection attribute on a UIComponent subclass MXML tag. This attribute gets set to the property, not the style.", 
   "ProgressBar has both a direction property and style. However, in this situation, they control different behaviors. It is not possible to code hint for the direction style in the CSS style declaration without removing the direction property from ASDoc. We are just going to have to live with this limitation.",
