   "Fixing an issue in the synapse.mar generation, earlier it has been done in the core module and then has been copied to the mar module which is wrong IMO and hence changed it to build the mar first and then build the core. This can be done because there are no sources in the mar and it is just a module.xml. Further it is required to build the mar first because when building core the generated mar is required to run the code tests."
