   "Fixed \".\"  problem, and buffer problems in SMTP Handler.  Put in freshly written CharTerminatedInputStream which does not include the terminated stream.  Highly robust and documented, but probably could use some optimization.  Also, SMTPHandler was having buffer problems when lots of data was passed at once because CharTerminatedInputStream was wrapping socketIn, rather than the BufferedReader.  Converted to DataInputStream (admitedly deprecated), and wraps this instead."
