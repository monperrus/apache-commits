   "-Use Drawing API-2 to render caps for every Line graphic element's strokes. As part of this, GradientStroke now implements IStroke and IStroke has a new method, generateGraphicsStroke() which returns a GraphicsStroke object representing this stroke. More refactoring to share graphics stroke logic between LinearGradientStroke and RadialGradientStroke.",

   "Flex now requires CSS Style declarations to declare @namespace rules and disambiguate between halo and spark components using CSS 3 namespace prefixes on type selectors. At compile time, this namespace information will be used to map type names to qualified ActionScript class names. At runtime, type selectors are matched on qualified ActionScript class name (for example mx.controls.Button rather than just Button). Flex 3 applications must be compiled with -compatibility-version=3.0.0 to get unqualified CSS type selector behavior.",

   "- Changed how a shared displayObject is positioned in a GraphicElement. Previously, it was always placed at (x,y). Now, it is placed at (0,0) if the displayObject can be shared (ie. it has no transforms). This solves the problem of a sharedDisplayObject getting repositioned without the GraphicElement being aware of it.", 
   "- Optimized Group.updateDisplayList so that we only redraw the GraphicElement's that share a displayObject that needs to be updated. Added a new class called InvalidatingSprite which has a single property called \"invalid\". If a GraphicElement needs to be redrawn, it marks its shared or unshared displayObject as invalid. Group will then only update the GraphicElements whose displayObject is marked invalid. Added invalidateDisplayList calls in a few missing places.", 
   "QE Notes: Some of the mustella bitmaps need to be regenerated. The player renders differently two transformed sprites that draw the same visuals. For example, a rotated sprite at (0,0) with a drawRect at (20,20) will look from a rotated sprite at (20,20) with a drawRect at (0,0).",
