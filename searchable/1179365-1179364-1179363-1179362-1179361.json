   "Updated SQL query utils.pm::get_connect_methods subroutine in utils.pm and renamed it to get_connect_method_info to match other subroutines. Updated OS.pm::process_connect_methods to handle the results returned by get_connect_method_info.",

   "VCL-503", 
   "Added OS.pm::execute_new. This isn't currently called by anything and will eventually replace OS.pm::execute. It uses Net::SSH::Expect to keep an SSH connection open and then commands are issued to this connection. This speeds things up. There are commented out \"return...execute_new\" lines at the beginning of OS.pm::execute and in utils.pm::run_ssh_command. Uncommenting these lines will cause the new subroutine to be used.",

   "Added OS type information to the hash returned by get_image_info.  Added OS.pm::get_management_node_identity_key_paths subroutine so that the comma-separated value is parsed consistently."
