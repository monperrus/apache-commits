   "o Removed it0048, and replaced it with a unit test for the DefaultProfileInjector.", 
   "o Reverted the logic of the DefaultProfileInjector to merge-and-override the model, with the profile being dominant", 
   "o Added merging for distributionManagement and modules (conditionally, based on flag) in the modelBase merge", 
   "o Refactored the override logic into a couple of methods in ModelUtils to make it easier to understand what's going on here.", 
   "o Verified that both the build and the model itself are being merged correctly during profile injection, with profile dominance, but persistence of changes to the model."
