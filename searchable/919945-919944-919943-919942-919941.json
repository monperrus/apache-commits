   "In order for #{component} to resolve correctly, pushComponentToEL/popComponentFromEL must be called before retrieving attributes or invoking callbacks when performing any kind of traversal. While TRINIDAD-1612 Add support for the new Lifecycle Management Methods (see spec section 3.1.14) covers this for the normal component processXXX methods, this JIRA addresses the other forms of component traversal for both the Trinidad framework itself and its component implementations. In particular, visitTree, invokeOnComponent and FlattenedComponent, processComponent are addressed."
