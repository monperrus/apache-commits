   "Made resources be \"generic\" in Mesos. You can now launch a slave with", 
   "the --resources flag. See the description in src/common/resources.hpp",

   "strings. Unfortuanately, there are a few parts of our design that are",

   "resources generic we might end up sending a resource offer that only", 
   "has mem. Since a scheduler will obviously reject this, it could then", 
   "filter any resources from that slave for a few seconds (making tests", 
   "take longer and giving weird semantics to existing users). This will", 
   "need to change, but for now the allocator only sends resource offers", 
   "that contain BOTH cpus and mem. :( The webui also heavily relies on", 
   "their being specific resources for cpu and mem."
