   "DERBY-2195: Trigger problems after maximum trigger count exception", 
   "This patch was contributed by Yip Ng (yipng168@gmail.com)", 
   "The system is not cleaning up the statement context properly. The", 
   "cleanup should have been performed in GenericTriggerExecutor's executeSPS", 
   "exception handler. The GenericTriggerExecutor is responsible to make sure", 
   "the SPS execution is cleanup correctly.",

   "and therefore will have a new statement context and pops it off from",

   "result in popping the wrong statement context. So the patch",
