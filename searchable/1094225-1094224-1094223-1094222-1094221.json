   "MAHOUT-479:  Implemented ClusterClassifier, ClusterPolicy(s) and ClusterIterator which can duplicate k-means and Dirichlet clustering in sequential execution only. Added unit tests and switched DisplayKMeans and DisplayDirichlet to use the ClusterIterator. Gives a pretty good sanity check of the clustering.", 
   "Changed pdf() implementation of GaussianCluster to use the product of the component pdfs vs the average. Seems to work a lot better.", 
   "Deprecated a number of old Dirichlet models and the experimental VectorModelClassifier.",
