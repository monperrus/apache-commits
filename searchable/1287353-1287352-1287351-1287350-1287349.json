   "Added support for explicitWidth,Height to DefaultGridItemRenderer and UITextFieldGridItemRenderer.", 
   "Although UITextField and UIFTETextField both sport explicitWidth,Height properties (but not a common class or interface that defines them) they don't automatically set these properties when you set their width,height and they reset width,height when you call setActualSize().     Since GridLayout only uses setlLayoutBounds() to resize a renderer, I set a flag there so that the concomitant calls to 'set width,height' don't also set explicitWidth,Height.", 
   "Removed the renderer constructor code that initialized the renderers actual width to 4096.   We're already dealing with that in createTypicalItemRenderer(), so the constructor code isn't needed.",
