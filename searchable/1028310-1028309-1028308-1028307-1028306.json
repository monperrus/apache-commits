   "[UIMA-1916] [UIMA-1917] remove the <modules> section - the uima-build-resources will be separately built, first, when releasing (if changed).  Add a property for the uima-build-resources version number, and use where needed. Remove dependencies entry to avoid it being inherited by children. remove special marker-file and profile control to avoid running remote-resources from uima-resource-bundle in this pom - no longer needed.  Remove the <dependency> element from the docbook processing profile - because it ends up adding the dependency to all the children, and change back to using maven-dependency-plugin:unpack instead of maven-dependency-plugin:unpack-dependencies goal, as a consequence."
