   "Partial fix for the new JSP 2.0 features running under the SecurityManager. The generated code needs some special permissions in order to run properly. Even when we do not protect any packages, the JSP 2.0 stuff still not works. Special permissions or doPrivileged block will needs to be added to the the generated code in order to work properly. This partial fix allows the JSP 2.0 example to run under the SecurityManager."
