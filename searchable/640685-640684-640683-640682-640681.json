   "OPENJPA-544. Get rid of JDK1.4 support, fold the jdk1.5 modules into their siblings, get rid of some ugly reflection that was there for 1.5 support, and move to the java.util.concurrent collections classes. This includes a wrapper around ConcurrentHashMap that allows nulls, since the old OpenJPA concurrent map allowed nulls and we rely on that behavior. The implication is that putIfAbsent() and some of the other special JDK1.5 methods don't obey the same contracts as in the java.util.concurrent package."
