   "[master] Improve regionserver generation timestamp handling on check-in; handle failures to write a RS ZK node", 
   "Author: mbautin", 
   "Summary:", 
   "There are three related changes here:", 
   "- Make the master correctly handle the regionserver generation timestamp on check-in (expire the older server out of the existing one for the host:port pair and the one checking in; do nothing if the two have the same generation timestamp)", 
   "- Avoid writing the regionserver ZK node on the master side when setting a watch on it", 
   "- Correctly handle failures to write the RS ZK node on the regionserver side and to set watch on it on the master side", 
   "Additionally, I am moving the server -> load and load -> server map manipulation logic from ServerManager to the new ServerLoadMap class and adding a unit test.",
