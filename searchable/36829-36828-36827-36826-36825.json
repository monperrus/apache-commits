   "- Added a compile-time check to enforce that there is only one @Jpf.MessageResource annotation with no \"bundleKey\" attribute, i.e., that there is only one which is used as the default.", 
   "- Fixed to prevent incorrect warnings about nonexistant .jpf files when they are referenced with relative URIs in @Jpf.Forward annotations.", 
   "- When instantiating a Control member field in a page flow, changed to include the request scope-ID in the control-ID when the request is a ScopedRequest.  This prevents duplicate-control exceptions for the same control-type/pageflow-type in two separate ScopedRequests.", 
   "- Made the ActionInterceptorChain (and all related classes) serializable, so they can be stored safely in Servlet objects that may need to serialize/deserialize.", 
   "- Made displayName/displayNameKey mutually exclusive on @Jpf.ValidatableProperty.", 
   "- Enabled a basic JSF/JPF test.  In order to run this, you need to point the JSF_HOME environment variable to the root of an expanded JSF 1.1 Reference Implementation distribution.  Then, do 'ant clean build start&' in netui/test/webapps/jsf, and hit http://localhost:8080/jsfWeb/jpfFaces/JpfFacesController.jpf.",
