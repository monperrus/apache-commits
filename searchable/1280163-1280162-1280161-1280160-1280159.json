   "Change the selection behavior on focusIn to be consistent with Halo with one exception.  The focusIn behavior is still subject to change but this is closer to final than what we have now.", 
   "As of this change, on focusIn, if there is no selection, if multiline (ie TextArea and RET), the insertion pt is set to 0,0, and if !multiline (ie TextInput) all the text is selected.  If the text/textFlow is set while the component already has focus the insertion pt is set to 0,0 (for ex. NumericStepper clicking up or down arrow).", 
   "The only remaining difference I know of between spark and halo is for TextInput.  halo TextInput on focusIn only remembers the previous selection, whether set programatically or with the mouse, if a selection was programatically set at some point.  spark TextInput will remember a previous selection regardless of how it was set.  The halo behavior doesn't make sense to me but we may end up changing spark to match.",
