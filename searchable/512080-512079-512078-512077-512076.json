   "DERBY-47 (partial): First incremental patch for the multi-probing (\"mp\")", 
   "approach described in Jira comments. As mentioned in that comment, we need",

   "predicates\" so that we do not incorrectly perform certain operations on",

   "- Updates several utility methods in BinaryRelationalOperatorNode to distinguish", 
   "\"true\" relational operators from ones that are created internally for probe", 
   "predicates.", 
   "There should be no functional changes to Derby as a result of this patch."
