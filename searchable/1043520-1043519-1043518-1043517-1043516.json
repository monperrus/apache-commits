   "[WSS-258] - \"Newer version of SecureConversation not recognised for derived key algorithm\"", 
   "- Added support for processing the more recent URI for P_SHA1", 
   "- Fixed a bug in DerivedKeyToken where it was adding a prefix for the \"Algorithm\" attribute. This attribute is not actually used by default, so it's unlikely to affect any existing code."
