   "-----------", 
   "Fix http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-23833 DragDrop of multiple items to Spark List is much slower than to Halo List", 
   "Problems:", 
   "1. The selection in the drag initiator was not getting properly cleared and it was causing n^2 operations for drag-moving n items.", 
   "2. The selection in the drop target was not getting properly cleared before the dropped elements were inserted, which resulted in n*m operations for inserting n items with m already selected items.", 
   "3. The LinearLayoutVector in the drop target was shifting cached sizes for each element inserted, resulting in m*n operations for dropping n items in front of m items.", 
   "Note #3 is not a drag-and-drop specific problem, but a problem for insert/delete in all virtual layout cases (vertical/horizontal).", 
   "Fixes:", 
   "1. & 2. - properly clear the selection before the remove/insert operations, as the selection is going to be updated after the operations anyway.", 
   "3. Modify the LinearLayoutVector to store insert/remove requests as pending intervals. The pending intervals get flushed before any size updates/reads are executed.",
