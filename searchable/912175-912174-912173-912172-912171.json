   "Fixed multiple bugs in Preferences and Preferences.jsp. Asserted names were not being set when \"save prefs\" button was pushed. PreferencesLocalePicker was not correctly matching incoming browser Locales to those available on the server. Time zones were not correctly being set. Preferences also had a static-method fetish, which was unnatural. It has been refactored completely and thoroughly."
