   "[HBASE-7416] augments tier compaction with fixed boundary option", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary: Currently, in tier compaction the aged-based algorithm considers HFile's age in disk relative to the current time, thus the tiers are actually shifting along the time. In order to best use our prior information about how applications consume the data, it needs another feature to perceive the tiers relative to a fixed time point. For more details, please refer to https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/wiki/index.php/HBase/Boundary_Based_Tier_Compaction", 
   "Test Plan: Modify the TestTierCompaction.java to accommodate the new feature.",

   "[HBASE-7408] Removes the pread/seek+read option and defaults it to pread", 
   "Author: rshroff", 
   "Summary:", 
   "The change removes the pread/seek+read option and", 
   "defaults the option to always do pread.", 
   "During the compaction phase, HBase was using sequential reads to load the HDFS blocks via DFSCLient. Sequential reads causes HDFS to perform prefetching of the data which might not be used necessarily used by HBase. The reasong being that the HFile Block might be already present in the cache or it might need to skip a few blocks in the HFile(Bloom filter blocks), etc. This leads to un necessary iops on disks as Hbase might have to seek to a new location to fetch more data which might not have been prefetched.", 
   "Doing preads will prevent this prefetching of the data and hence reduce the iops on disks.", 
   "The actual performance numbers will be obtained by deploying this change on one of the shadow clusters.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "Execute the unit tests",

   "TestHFileWriterV2 is failing, looking into it.", 
   "After the review, will deploy it on shadow cluster to measure the", 
   "performance.",
