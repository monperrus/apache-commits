   "r/m unused code dealing with sstables, and ConcurrentWriter / FastConcurrentWriter.  mmap is not faster than write() for sequential I/O, which is what the vast majority of our writes are.  mmap _does_ have an advantage when we seek back to the start of a commitlog segment to update the headers after memtable flush, but we do that infrequently enough that it's not worth the disadvantages (primarily, blowing up if we exceed the 4MB size).",
