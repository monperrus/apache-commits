   "Remove lua_ap_banner, as it's no longer being used.", 
   "Add ivm_get/ivm_set for Inter-VM data transfer. This allows multiple VMs across a process to share data without having to resort to external databases or filesystems. This is a work in progress, and I have yet to work out a proper way of resetting a variable without causing a memory leak (this could be done by allocating a new pool for each object, but I'm trying to see if there's a more efficient way). Comments, ideas etc are most welcome."
