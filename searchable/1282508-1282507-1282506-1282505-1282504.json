   "Fix focus issues introduced by TLF build 545.  When setText() or setTextFlow() is called when we have focus, make sure there is a text flow with composer in place, the controller has focus and there is an insertion point of 0,0 so typing can continue without a mouse click or a mouse hover.  The caller can set a different insertion point by calling selectRange() after calling setText() or setTextFlow().",

   "In the past when the width (or maxWidth) wasn\u2019t specified we told TLF that the width was our default maxWidth=10000.  This had implications especially when the text was rtl or textAlign != left because it aligned over a width of 10000. With this change we let TLF measure.  It will figure out the widest line and use that for the width.  Text will be aligned on that width.  So if there is only one line, and no explicit width, left, center and right alignment all look the same.", 
   "Truncation results will be slightly different now if there isn\u2019t an explicit width.  We will let TLF measure the width and it will use that width for the truncation.  Depending on whether the last line is the widest line or not, it may have to remove some of the text to make room for the truncation indicator.",

   "This fixes the problem that if two text components share the same textFlow there is an infinite loop involving updateDisplayList -> damageHandler -> invalidateDisplaylist -> back to updateDisplayList.  The bug file was for TextArea which is RET but the same bug was in RichText as well.", 
   "This example with a renderer exposed it because the typicalItem that is composed to figure out sizes and the actual first item in the list share the same textFlow.  It actually has nothing to do with useVirtualDisplay other than it was sharing a textFlow.", 
   "It turns out that the TextFlowFactory dispatches damage events every time the textFlow is composed.  Unlike when the flowComposer is used, it always considers the flow damaged.  It was exacerbated by each of the two components having a damage handler for the same textFlow.", 
   "The solution is to use the textFlow generation number.  In the damageHandler if the generation is the last known generation number, assume no changes, and return immediately from the damage handler.",
