   "Summary: Chopping the amount of code generated by Thrift for PHP services by two orders of magnitude (approx 25% of the previous size). This is done via putting more logic in a dynamic base class and taking it out of the generated code. Hopefully this wins back the CPU cycles paid just to load code from APC at the cost of a marginal increase in dynamic execution runtime.",
