   "[MNG-3698] Moved concrete/dynamic transitions out to the lifecycle executor to make them happen less often, and added code to check whether reactorProjects are used or reachable (via session parameter) before calculating their concrete state blindly. Also, conserving the RegexBasedInterpolator (the class from plexus-interpolator) to keep from reconstructing the Pattern instance inside it repeatedly. Added a buffer size to the StringWriter used in the interpolator, and finally changed the concrete calculation to avoid some needless project-instance cloning (which as it turns out is wrong...see MNG-3700). Performance is significantly improved, and memory usage has been cut from what it used in 2.0.9."
