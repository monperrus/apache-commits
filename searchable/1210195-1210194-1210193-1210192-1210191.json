   "The reason is outdated JS in messages.ftl", 
   "jleroux: I did not use andrewzn's solution because it overrode another part of the screen. I tried to understand why humanMsg, which has been adapted during jQuery move, did not work. I guess it's simply because biznessTime application.js is not loaded; though it's declared in BizznessTimeThemeData.xml as VT_HDR_JAVASCRIPT. At this stage, as I was missing time, I decided to simply reuse the same way than in webcommon messages.ftl"
