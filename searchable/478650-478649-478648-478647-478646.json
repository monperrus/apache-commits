   "Changed the HTTPD configuration commands to allow the Tuscany runtime install directory to be configured on a server basis, and the other configuration (tuscany system root and search path) to be configured on a location/directory basis. Also added temporary HTML generation to the HTTPD handler to print the current configuration."

   "Minor changes to make SCARuntime usable by server side bindings. Added static getter methods to the existing setter methods to allow bindings to get the current runtime configuration info. Added a method to set the runtime install directory instead of just depending on an environment variable, to allow it to be configured in httpd.conf with an HTTPD configuration command."
