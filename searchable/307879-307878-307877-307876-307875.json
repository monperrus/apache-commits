   "- added optional 'bufferSize' param to SocketHubAppender, implemented as a cyclic buffer.  As new clients attach to the appender, they receive the events in the cyclic buffer.  Suggested by Paul Smith.",

   "- improved support for evaluation of expressions (focus-on works and fieldresolver builds exception string).",

   "- chainsawappenderhandler now waits to process events until the identifier expression has been set",
