   "Added patch so that XTags works on WebLogic 6.0 SP1. Its a nasty hack but will hopefully be removed later. Basically using dom4j's JAXP loading of SAX parsers seems to SEGV the JVM when running under WebLogic 6 for some wierd reason - no other servlet engine seems to suffer the same problem. Will investigate further and remove the hack ASAP"
