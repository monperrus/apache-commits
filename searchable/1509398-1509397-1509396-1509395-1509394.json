   "* Fixed some code and documentation based on an incorrect/outdated interpretation of the StAX specs: the writeNamespace and writeDefaultNamespace methods in XMLStreamWriter are actually expected to update the namespace context, and explicit calls to setPrefix and setDefaultPrefix are therefore not required.", 
   "* Fixed an issue with the XMLStreamWriter implementation in the Oracle JRE caused by the fact that writeStartElement(String,String,String) updates the namespace context. The fix addresses this issue through the StAX dialect mechanism."
