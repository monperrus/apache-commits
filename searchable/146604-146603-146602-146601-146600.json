All the implementation code is now in the seperate impl package to make things simpler to follow. Also the first example Messagelet now runs, EchoMessagelet gets called correctly in Tomcat 4.0 though still the streams need to be wired together along with an inbuilt replyTo code so that simple servlets can be written to generate text responses"
