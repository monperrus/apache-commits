   "FLUME-252: Update tail to get rid of races and truncation problems", 
   "- This version uses Java NIO Channels and ByteBuffers", 
   "- Fiex FLUME-205 (tail breaks UTF8) by using ByteBuffers", 
   "- Fixes FLUME-232 (tailsource adds newlines) by using ts own readline implementation", 
   "- Fixes FLUME-248 (Tail source does not close files, leaks file handles in normal operation)", 
   "- Usually passes tests from FLUME-218 (race condition in tail source) comments", 
   "- Adds documentation to be more precise about tail's semantics.", 
   "- Added release notes about how this is not a complete fix",
