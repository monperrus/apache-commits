   "* Add ClearContext command to post-op chain, but it does not fix the problem with having to click twice to change filters.", 
   "* The problem is that the list is being refreshed, in case we are switching to editing mode. The critiera for the prior filter is sticking the context (somewhere), and is being merged into the new critieria set. This is not a problem when we use the same filter, since the old value overwrite the new, only when we are switching filters."
