   "FSFS: Shard revision files and revprop files into many directories by default.", 
   "This changes the path used to store revisions and revprop files so they",

   "default scheme, r12345 will now be stored in the file db/revs/12/12345.",

   "on filesystems that prohibit directories larger than a certain size",
