   "TUSCANY-2801 - Create a SystemContribution to hold data from definitions.xml found in extensions and in application contributions. This change creates a system contribution on the fly in the node and installs a DefaultModelResolver for various policy elements. The default resolver not takes account of any default imports that are available. All application level contributions are linked to the system contribution via a default import that references the system contributions model resolver. Hence policy element resolution will traverse the tree to the system contribution if the element is not resolved locally. We may want to create specific policy resolvers here but this change allows for some experimentation. The next hurdle to getting this to work is to get policy set XPath applied to the assembly model again."
