   "QPID-2412: Support for EXTERNAL mechanism on client-authenticated SSL connections.", 
   "On SSL connection where the clients certificate is authenticated (requires the --ssl-require-client-authentication option at present), the clients identity will be taken from that certificate (it will be the CN with any DCs present appended as the domain, e.g. CN=bob,DC=acme,DC=com would result in an identity of bob@acme.com). This will enable the EXTERNAL mechanism when cyrus sasl is in use.", 
   "The client can still negotiate their desired mechanism. There is a new option on the ssl module (--ssl-sasl-no-dict) that allows the options on ssl connections to be restricted to those that are not vulnerable to dictionary attacks (EXTERNAL being the primary example)."
