   "Fixed ErrorHandler - showDebugInfo was removed from ContextManager as", 
   "an \"explicit\" property. Larry - we can add it back, I just wanted to", 
   "test the setProperty mechanism.", 
   "The fix also allow contexts to override the setting in context manager -", 
   "you can set it now at context level.", 
   "What's interesting is that it does that without any special code in core -", 
   "any new attributes can be added to <context > and <contextManager> tags.", 
   "We should add properties to Context and ContextManager only if they are", 
   "very generic ( like \"home\" ).", 
   "Another method to do the same thing is to use per/context interceptors,", 
   "or settings on the interceptor ( for example showDebugInfo=\"true\" on the", 
   "error handler ). This is better if the attribute is specific to a particular", 
   "module ( like session saving in a file ). For showDebugInfo, it's likely that", 
   "other modules will use it."
