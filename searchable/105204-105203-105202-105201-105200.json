   "Update the description of digest support for 2004, adding Konqueror, Mac IE, and Safari as supporting browsers, and lynx as an (apparently) non-supporting browser. Confirmation of the official lynx home would be welcome -- lynx.browser.org and UKans both have older versions.", 
   "I *believe* IE/Mac (which has a much different code base than IE/Win) doesn't have the GET bug described on Windows -- at least I can request a URL like \"http://myhost/?testing\" and successfully log in and get to http://myhost/, but I'm not sure if there's a subtlety I missed. I also alphabetized the (fairly long) list of browsers (keeping Mozilla and Netscape together), and toned down the warning about lack of support, since everything but lynx now seems to handle digest auth.",
