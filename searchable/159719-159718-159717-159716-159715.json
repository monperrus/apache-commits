   "Reenabled low-level SPI for control instantiation, allowing other bean-oriented frameworks (such as HiveMind or Spring) to be plugged in to instantiate, configure, and add services for Controls.  I'll be working on creating a couple of sample provider implementations plus a sample app that uses them.", 
   "This created a new dependency for Controls on Commons Discovery, which provides the SPI discovery mechanism.  Since there are now dependencies on Discovery from WSM, NetUI, and Controls, it has been moved to lib/commons in the distribution, along with Commons Logging (upon which Discovery depends)."
