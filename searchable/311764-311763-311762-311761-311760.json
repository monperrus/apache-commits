   "- Detail panel was toggling between 'nothing selected' to the last row's detail text for every batch of events received.  Fixed the problem by not processing selection change events where the first and last index are the same.", 
   "- One more annoying issue to correct - row is getting unselected frequently (when new events are received but scroll to bottom is disabled, when a color filter is applied)."
