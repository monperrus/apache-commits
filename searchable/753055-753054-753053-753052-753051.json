   "Fixed an exception that occurred when trying to import a WOLips-based EOModel that had embedded EOFetchSpecifications.  The old style used by EOModeler had a colon at the end of the selector, such as: selectorName = \"isEqualTo:\";.  WOLips leaves out the colon and this caused the model import to fail completely because none of the selectors matched."
