   "[master] improve error handling in getRegionServerWithRetries()",

   "retry only for NSRE. retry once if region server connection fails.", 
   "sleep on nsre only if location hasn't changed.", 
   "enable so_linger for 0 seconds.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "Test 1 - simulate connection timeout", 
   "===", 
   "pick a region server that doesn't have meta or root", 
   "make the rs unavailable using iptables", 
   "verify connect time failures, retries and that the settings hbase.client.retries.number, hbase.client.rpc.retry.timeout are working", 
   "Test 2 - simulate connection reuse on dead server", 
   "==", 
   "increase hbase.ipc.client.connection.maxidletime", 
   "fetch a key from a rs", 
   "make rs unavailable", 
   "fetch the same key from rs", 
   "SocketReadTimeoutException - no retries.", 
   "Test 3 - try to simulate a write failure on a reused connection", 
   "==", 
   "set hbase.rpc.timeout to 10 minutes and hbase.client.rpc.retry.timeout to 20 minutes", 
   "reduce system sysctl setting net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 from 15 to 6 (more than 10 minutes write retry to about 1 minute)", 
   "Verify that the first attempt fails. (It fails with java.io.IOException: Call to msgstore275.snc4.facebook.com/10.30.224.186:60020 failed on local exception: java.io.IOException: Connection timed out. Would have been better if the failure was more specific. The write always success. The read fails.)", 
   "Verify that connection is retried", 
   "We are not cleaning up the cache in this case - because the read fails with IOException.", 
   "We should set the  net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 property to 4 on all our systems for a faster write failure signal. This should definitely be smaller than the socket read timeout. (the TCP_USER_TIMEOUT socket option is not available in java?)", 
   "Test 4 - write to a dead connection", 
   "send a rpc", 
   "kill the regionserver", 
   "send a rpc", 
   "get EOFException. verify that retries happen. should we retry here? this is read failing.",
