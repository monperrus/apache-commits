   "Introduced a DecodeMonitor object with 2 basic implementations (SILENT, STRICT). The decoding classes/methods in codec have been upgraded to use a DecodeMonitor instead of the internal boolean strict. Fixed a bug in QuotedPrintableInputStream that sometimes was not converting a lonely LF to CRLF. Added some malformation monitoring to QuotedPrintableInputStream (lone LF and lone CR are \"monitored\"). Added some more invalid data monitoring to Base64InputStream that now \"notifies\" unexpected chars (non base64, non CR, LF or SP). (MIME4J-158 + MIME4J-161)"
