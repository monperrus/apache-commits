   "MYFACES-304: If a global message is added to the FacesContext (clientId is null), then someone calls getClientIdsWithMessages(), the Iterator that is returned should include null.  It does not;  it does correctly do this on the RI.", 
   "Also, from code inspection, it appears that getClientIdsWithMessages() will return a client ID twice if two messages are added against the same client ID.", 
   "Changes made:", 
   "1. Simplified & improved getClientIdsWithMessages() to return an Iterator of a HashSet (thus unique) created from the _messageClientIds List.", 
   "2. Removed the logic which stripped out the null."
