   "Added/revised DataGrid,Grid typicalItem property.   GridLayout now computes GridColumn widths, for columns without an explicit with, based on the typical item renderer's preferredBoundsWidth().  GridLayout does not yet give the ColumnHeaderBar a shot at increasing column widths based on its own items.  See GridLayout/updateVisibleColumnWidths().", 
   "Removed GridLayout override for typicalLayoutElement since it's not used.   And since typicalLayoutElement doesn't make sense, since one \"typical\" layout element is needed per column.   See GridLayout/createTypicalItemRenderer().", 
   "Removed GridLayout/getTypicalItemRenderer().", 
   "Removed (already commented out) HACK #1,#2 code.", 
   "Commented out body of GridLayout/measure() for now.   This is going to need work.", 
   "Removed explicit width values from DefaultColumnHeaderRenderer.",
