   "Cluster test code now has a persistence switch controlled by the environment. When this switch set, all brokers start with the store module loaded, all queues are declared persistent and all messages are also made persistent. The absolute paths to module libs hardcoded into the test fixtures have been replaced by paths relative to environment variable QPID_LIB_DIR (which is set in Makefile.am). The cluster test, when run from qpid, will continue to run without persistence by default; the intention is to have the store test code run this test directly with the switch turned on."
