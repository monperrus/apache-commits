   "Fixed problem with positioning of content when reference-orientation=\"180\" is used. CTM is now correct. It is updated after the height of the content is known. Instead of somehow inverting the element list, I've simply declared this case non-breakable, i.e. I generate one box.", 
   "Fixed a few other problems mostly occurring when rotating block-container content by 90 or 270 degrees plus a few remaining auto-height handling problems. This involved switching off some sometimes unwanted side-effects from auto-updating the BPD in some area classes."
