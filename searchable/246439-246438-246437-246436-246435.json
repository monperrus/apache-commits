   "Changes are made to support the Round2B Interop Tests.", 
   "Most of the changes are related to the client samples.echo.TestClient", 
   "to invoke the Round2B operations.", 
   "-----------------------------------------------------", 
   "You should notice the Round 2B results in the grid", 
   "the next time the interop tests are run.", 
   "-----------------------------------------------------", 
   "Detailed Summary of Changes:", 
   "1) Change EchoService to properly receive and echo a String[][]", 
   "for the echo2DStringArray method.  (Was String[].)", 
   "2) Made cosmetic changes to EchoService to change the", 
   "parameter names to match the xml schema description.", 
   "3) Added equals() and toString() methods to SOAPArrayStruct and", 
   "SOAPStructStruct classes to allow TestClient to verify", 
   "echo'ed objects of these classes.", 
   "4) Changed the TestClient to use stub code instead of dii to", 
   "call the services.  This change was made due to the", 
   "complexity of the new methods.", 
   "5) Stub files and other client side artifacts were generated", 
   "and are checked in.  Some changes were made to the", 
   "code to support the existing TestClient behavior.", 
   "In the future, I would like to move to a more", 
   "automated approach.", 
   "6) Changed TestClient to add calls/verification of the", 
   "Round 2B interop methods.  I ran Sam's script and", 
   "it appears that Axis is conforming!", 
   "7) Some changes to the deploy.wsdd file.", 
   "8) Improved the implementation of javax.xml.rpc.namespace.QName.", 
   "(I also noticed that the current code is out-of-date with", 
   "the spec and will need to be changed!)", 
   "9) Changed WSDL2Java stub writer to fix a problem with", 
   "hex binary.", 
   "10) The echo2DString array revealed two problems in WSDL2Java", 
   "related to interpretting multi-dimensional arrayType values.", 
   "These are now fixed.", 
   "11) Axis serializes String[][] using an \"array of array of string\"", 
   "style.  The echo2DStringArray method requires a \"xsd:string[2,2]\"", 
   "style.  (I did a test and only 2 services accepted the first format", 
   "while 6 services accepted the second format.)  As a result", 
   "I enabled the code in ArraySerializer which will serialize", 
   "the array using the \"xsd:string[2,2]\" style when appropriate."
