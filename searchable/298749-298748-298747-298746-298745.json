   "Require that the user explicitly configure that they want Tomcat to register the (deprecated) SSL handler.", 
   "The previous behavior of register-always was just pure evil.  At best it did nothing (if JSSE isn't installed, or you are using a non-Sun 1.4.x vendor), at worst it breaks apps.  It also hasn't been necessary for Tomcat internals in any versions 3.3-5.0 for a very long time (none of them use java.net.URL to construct the redirect-URL).  It also creates problems if you are using Sun's 1.4.x JVM, since the handler it installs is deprecated.",
