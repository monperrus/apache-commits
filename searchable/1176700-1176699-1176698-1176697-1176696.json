   "To deploy a site with a non-built-in protocol, you need to add the corresponding wagon provider. Out of the box, Maven 3 only supports file:, http: and https: as transport protocols. Maven 2 adds scp: to this list. If you try to deploy a site with an unsupported protocol, you'll get an error. See https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/adding-deploy-protocol.html"
