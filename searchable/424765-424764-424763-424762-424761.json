   "APE (Atom Protocol Exerciser) tool.", 
   "1. WARNING: Content-type must be 'application/atomserv+xml',", 
   "not 'application/xml'", 
   "Fixed. The service doc now uses content-type 'application/atomserv+xml'",

   "3. Found these collections:",

   "'Media Files' accepts *", 
   "4. Will use collection 'Weblog Entries' for entry creation", 
   "5. WARNING: No collection for 'image/jpeg', won't test media posting", 
   "On step #5, it's complaining because you say <accept>*</accept>, which I", 
   "think isn't valid per 2616, you need */*", 
   "Fixed warnings #2 and #5. Instead of returning \"*\" we now return the", 
   "content-types specified in the site config.", 
   "And site admins are now allowed to specify both allowed/forbidden file", 
   "extensions and content-types in the allowed extension fields, but we really", 
   "need a better solution here. Perhaps we should EOL the allowed/forbidden", 
   "extensions field and replace it with allowed/forbidden content-type fields.", 
   "7. WARNING: Entries feed not valid per (non-normative) RNC schema:", 
   "(unknown file):4: error: required elements missing", 
   "Fixed. Added feed-level atom:id and atom:updated elements for all returned",

   "eliminate confusion about which editURI is for the entry and which is for",
