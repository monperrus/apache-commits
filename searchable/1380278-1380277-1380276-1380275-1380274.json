   "@Mock and @Uri are now qualifiers. Added an example of Endpoint injection via @Named. Also simplified the use of @Inject with camel injection; it now requires a qualifier if using @Inject to inject Endpoint/ProducerTemplate of either @Mock, @Uri, @Named - otherwise don't use @Inject and just use the vanilla Camel injection annotations (@Produce or @EndpointInject). The use of qualifiers avoids all kinds of CDI issues when trying to mix and match @Inject @EndpointInject and @Inject @Named in the same application; for Endpoint/ProducerTemplate injection there must be a unique qualifier used now. Note @Consume doesn't do injection per se so @Inject is never used directly with it. Finally @Mock() now takes an optional URI for the MockEndpoint"
