   "- Fixed ClassCastExceptions when using an interface type (an XMLBean interface) as an action method's form bean, or in the outputFormBean/outputFormBeanType/returnAction attributes on @Jpf.Forward, or in a @Jpf.ValidatableBean annotation, or in @Jpf.ActionOutput annotation.", 
   "- Added a warning when forwarding to a page outside the current page flow from an exception handler, a @Jpf.Catch, or a validation error forward.  In this situation, message resources on the destination page will not come from the current page flow.", 
   "- Changed so that with assertions turned off, running the page flow compiler against an out-of-date (and not supported) beehive-netui-pageflow.jar will not blow up.", 
   "- Fixed to avoid an NPE when raising a page flow action from a JSF page, when the page flow action has validation rules.", 
   "- Removed outdated jpf-struts-config--global.xml module registration in DRT webapp.",
