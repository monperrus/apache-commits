   "Reverted previous fix to lone failing JSPWikiMarkupParserTest and added checks into ContentManager.addPage() that recycles Nodes that haven't been saved yet. This fixes the edge-case bug that the failing test uncovered: a caller that created a particular WikiPage twice via addPage() -- without calling WikiPage.save() in between invocations -- created a same-named-sibling (SNS) in JCR. Instead of doing this, we simply re-use this Node in the returned WikiPage."
