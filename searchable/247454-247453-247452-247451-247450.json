   "This is the fix for the multi-ref problem reported John Gregg.", 
   "Summary of problem:", 
   "The multi-ref serialization is using a HashMap to determine", 
   "whether instances are multi-ref'd.  This does not work because a HashMap uses", 
   "the hashCode/equals methods of the object...and for generated", 
   "Axis beans these methods do not test object identity (they test member equality).", 
   "This resulted in separate instances being serialized as one instance.", 
   "Patch:", 
   "John provided a small patch to SerializationContextImpl", 
   "that forced the multi-ref HashMap to use the object identity", 
   "hashCode.", 
   "Thanks John for debugging this problem!!", 
   "Tom Jordahl ran into problems when he installed the patch.", 
   "(I looked at this a little and I believe the problem is due", 
   "to the multi-ref HashMap being cloned and its keys iterated.", 
   "This caused problems because the keys in the patch were no", 
   "longer the original instance values.)", 
   "Solution:", 
   "I proposed an alternate solution that Tom agreed with.", 
   "A new class IdentityHashMap is added to utils.  This class", 
   "behaves like a HashMap except that under the covers the", 
   "keys are differentiated by object identity instead of", 
   "the keys hashCode method.  The keys() method returns", 
   "the original key values instead of the mangled keys...", 
   "Looking at the SerializationContextImpl code, I believe that", 
   "the same problems can occur with the secondLevelObjects.", 
   "So I changed secondLevelObjects to be an IdentityHashMap.", 
   "I added John's test and I added an extra test to", 
   "the existing multi-ref test to verify the new code.", 
   "PR:", 
   "Obtained from:", 
   "Submitted by:", 
   "Reviewed by:"
