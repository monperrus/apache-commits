   "Re-organize the Controls test web application to make it easier to build / debug with an IDE.  This makes several major changes:", 
   "- reorg the controls/test/webapps/ directory to represent a single webapp with the web/ + src/ structure", 
   "- change the way Milton / Mantis code generate Page Flows and JUnit tests that drive Page Flows.  The Milton tool was writing JPFs into a hard coded directory; now, the source files it writes are put into a \"srcgen\" directory and then copied into the appropriate places.  There are only 6 code generated files, AFAICT, so it should be easy to decouple from Milton and remove it entirely.", 
   "- fixup the way that the controlsWeb webapp is built for distribution testing.  Because of the dependencies of controlsWeb, the builds are different between the distribution tests and SVN.  This should be easy to fix, but I've not done it here.", 
   "- move all .java source files from web/ to src/",
