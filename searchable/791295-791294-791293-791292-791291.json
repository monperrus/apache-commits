   "Handle the case where one key has reached maxActive but other keys have not. Prior to this patch, once a latch associated with the key that had reach the front of the allocation queue, all allocations would be blocked until a suitable object was available. With this patch if maxActive is set, allocate() looks at every object in the allocation queue (subject to any totalActive limit) rather than just the first."
