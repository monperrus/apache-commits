   "Patch so that Tag instances stay around after the run() method has been invoked. This allows tags to work properly when asynchronous excecution takes place or if dynamic scripts or tags are used, where they may invoke after their parent's run() method has been called.", 
   "This should finally fix the last of the bugs introduced by making Script objects shareable across threads and Tag instances pooled per thread.", 
   "Also for good measure, added a new demo:werkz target that demonstrates the werkz tag library in action."
