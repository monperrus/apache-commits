   "TRINIDAD-17 Need to support mapping icons via -tr-rule-ref like we do with styles.", 
   "Now -tr-rule-ref works for icons.", 
   "This checkin contains a FINEST message if we think it is an icon, but it gets written to the stylesheet.", 
   "The code would be a little more complicated to know for sure if it was an icon so I did not add it.", 
   "That would involve: 1. if we can't find a selector, look for it in the 'icon' selector list. If we find it there, resolve to see if it has a content. It's too much code for this unusual usecase. I'll rely on the Design Time to warn the user."
