   "Improved Cactus logging. Cactus logging is now enabled by a <code>cactus.enableLogging=true</code> property that needs to be either defined in <code>cactus.properties</code> (which also needs to be part of the server WAR if you wish to turn on logging on the server side) or by using a java parameter (<code>-Dcactus.enableLogging=true</code>). If Log4J is not in the classpath, then logging is disabled."
