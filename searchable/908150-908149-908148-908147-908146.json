   "The first problem we have had is that components need to separate the context setup and teardown needed to process their children from the context setup and tear down of the components themselves.  For example, consider a composite component that establishes an EL context for its children--that context should only be setup when the children are being processed, not when the component is processing its own attributes.", 
   "In the case of encoding, we want to delegate to the Renderer to ensure that the setup and teardown of context for child processing is consistent between optimized rendering using tree visiting and full rendering traversals.", 
   "The second problem was that UIXComponent.setUpEncodingContext was named differently than all of the other set up methods.  I've made the spelling consistent (which after a quick check of the dictionary is consitently wrong through out Trinidad setup as a compound word is a noun and as a verb is two words, so it should have been setUp.  Drat!) and temporarily left a final deprecated version in that I will whack shortly.", 
   "The third issue is that iterating components often want to modify only the manner in which their data is iterated over.  To simplify this, we add a hook visitData() to UIXCollection.",
