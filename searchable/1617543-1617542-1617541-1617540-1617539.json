   "[UIMA-3969] do some json init for context info.  Factor out some common enqueue code and add a facility to track which types are used, and if the used types actually need namespaces to disambiguate them.  Replace multiple cas.getTypeSystemImpl() with a simple ref to \"tsi\" declared final.  Add some more json scaffolding - a test to see if a feature code is being encoded as an in-place value or as a FS Ref.  Add scaffolding for writting all FSs in the type-first order used by one of the JSON formats.  Include the approximate sorting of these - following default annotation sort order.  Add missing logic for a feature which is a byteArray."
