   "MyFaces (http://incubator.apache.org/myfaces/index.html) is an open source implementation of JavaServer Faces.  It's a fellow Apache project, and it deserves first-class treatment in Beehive... so now it has it.  This change does the following:", 
   "- Fixes http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-292 : JSF/Page Flow integration blows up with MyFaces", 
   "- Upgrades to MyFaces 1.0.7, for building against the JSF API in the pageflow module.", 
   "- Changes the JSF DRT webapp to run against either MyFaces or the JSF Reference Implementation.  To run against MyFaces, type 'ant drt.myfaces' under netui/test/webapps/jsf.  To run against the JSF RI, type 'ant drt.jsf-ri'.", 
   "This checkin also includes a change to the way TestRecorder works.  Previously, the TestRecorder ant target 'server.test' would call back into the webapp build file to run 'clean' and 'build' targets.  This was unnecessary, since the webapp builds could call these (or depend on these) on their own.  The JSF DRT webapp needed the flexibility to run its new 'build.myfaces' or 'build.jsf-ri', depending on the DRTs being run, so this needed to change now.", 
   "Finally, there's an unrelated fix in here for http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-293 : Need warning when @Jpf.Action has both outputFormBean and readOnly=true",
