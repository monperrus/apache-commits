   "* SemanticIndex and Store use now generics. This allows to use it for other types than ContentItem", 
   "* SemanticIndex Endpoint types (RESTful and Java) do use now Strings for lookup (instead of the EndpointTypeEnum and Class objects). This allows to use the SemanticIndexManager to lookup both RESTful and Java Endpoints and also allows to search for RESTful endpoint types that are not included in the EndpointTypeEnum", 
   "* SemanticIndexManager now ungets SemanticIndex that are not returned (However I think this implementation needs to be changed to use a ServiceTracker instead of searching the BundleContext on each request to solve this completly!)", 
   "* Added some TODOs (e.g. on some places there is the implicit assumption that only a single Store instance is running)"
