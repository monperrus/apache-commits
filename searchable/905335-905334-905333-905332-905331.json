   "This patch adds support for reserving physical hosts to a list of specified users.  Changes are to rpyctypes.py and the scheduler (primitive.py).  Currently, the user creating the VM will need to know what host has been reserved for him and will need to specify the host to send his vm to (with the --hints targetHost=hostname option). (Thanks to Richard Gass <richardgass@gmail.com>)"
