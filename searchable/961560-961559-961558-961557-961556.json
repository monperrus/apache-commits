   "Fix for ROL-1871: Media File upload did not recognize PDF, saved it as \"octet stream\"", 
   "I was not able to duplicate this on my machine (Mac) and I suspect it happens only on Windows, but sometimes when you upload a Media File, Struts cannot guess the content-type correctly and defaults to an 'octet stream' type. This commit adds logic to double-check and whenever an 'octet-stream' type file is uploaded, Roller will now attempt to use the file's extension to guess a more accurate content-type.",
