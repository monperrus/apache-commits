   "A patch from Brett Palmer \"Adding Tomcat Catalina configuration for \"privileged\" applications\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-2945) - OFBIZ-2945", 
   "Out of the box Tomcat allows you to configure \"privileged\" applications by specifying the context as follows.", 
   "<Context path=\"/manager\" debug=\"0\" privileged=\"true\"", 
   "docBase=\"/usr/local/kinetic/tomcat6/server/webapps/manager\">", 
   "</Context>", 
   "Since OFBiz is an embedded version of Tomcat it does not currently include a similar configuration for privileged applications.", 
   "The Tomcat manager application is a \"privileged\" application that includes utilities for monitoring JMX resources such as thread counts, connections, and any other configured JMX parameter. We use JMX with Hyperic to monitor our OFBiz servers", 
   "BTW, I used almost the same for Lambda Probe (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-1397)"
