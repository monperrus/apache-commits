   "Changed xCAT.pm's load() sub to check if the OS module has implemented a post_load() sub instead of checking if the OS name was winvista. This has the same effect but is more generic.", 
   "Renamed xCAT.pm::capture_prepare() to capture(). This follows the design described on the list. A provisioning module's capture() sub will take care of everything instead of splitting it up into capture_prepare() and capture_monitor().", 
   "Added code to xCAT.pm::capture() to check if OS module has implemented a pre_capture() sub. If not, it checks if the OS module has implemented a capture_prepare() sub. All OS modules will eventually have pre_capture() subs but this will work through the transition.  If OS::pre_capture() exists and has returned 1, it powers on the computer and proceeds to monitor the capture.", 
   "Added subs to xCAT.pm: power_reset(), power_on(), power_off(), power_status(), wait_for_on(), wait_for_off().", 
   "Made changes to xCAT.pm::_rpower() so it can use either a passed argument or the data structure to determine the computer node name.  It can also be called as an object method or class method."
