   "I saw the potential for a reported bug--where a get returns the wrong item under heavy load from a lateral request.  Although I do not recommend using laterals to get, it should work.", 
   "I put the operations that must occur in order in a synchronized block, insuring that gets from one lateral to another will not get mixed.  Needs to be improved, but should prevent any wrong elements from being returned.  . . .", 
   "Get timeout failures now zombie the lateral and start recovery.  Otherwise, since they do not occur in the background, the cache could grind to a halt.", 
   "The worst case now is that if another lateral gets hung, a caller trying to get will block until the timout.  Removes and puts are all synchronous calls."
