   "HTTPCLIENT-1164: Implemented a new CompressionDecorator aimed at replacing", 
   "the ContentEncodingHttpClient. This reuses the same request/response", 
   "interceptors with some minor additions to make the resulting response", 
   "semantically consistent (i.e. if a response is uncompressed, we mark the", 
   "entity as having an unknown length and remove the Content-Length header", 
   "before passing the response upstream). This allows the CompressionDecorator", 
   "and CachingHttpClient to be wired around a DefaultHttpClient in either order", 
   "and still get cache hits, depending on whether you want to cache compressed", 
   "or uncompressed bodies.", 
   "Minor change to ResponseContentEncoding to set a context variable that the", 
   "uncompression was applied. Only other change was to deprecate the", 
   "ContentEncodingHttpClient."
