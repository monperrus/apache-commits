   "Integrated TLF build 442. This integration required some minor changes to framework code.", 
   "---", 
   "The advanced text format styles for Spark components now include four new inheriting styles corresponding to new TLF formats:", 
   "paragraphSpaceBefore and paragraphSpaceAfter are for adding space before and after a paragraph.", 
   "paragraphStartIndent and paragraphEndIndent are for indenting the entire paragraph (not just its first line), from either the \"starting\" or \"ending\" side, which depend on the direction of the paragraph.", 
   "All four styles are specified in pixels, and have a default value of 0 coming from the global selector.", 
   "You can set these styles on a component and they'll apply to all paragraphs. For example, simply setting <s:TextArea paragraphSpaceAfter=\"20\"> will put 20 pixels of space after each paragraph.", 
   "TLF has removed its old non-inheriting marginXXX formats, so markup like <p marginBottom=\"20\">...</p> is no longer allowed in text content. These formats were in the FXG 1.0 spec, so FXG 1.0 compilation will need to change to map",

   "* API and markup Changes (Fix 2339174)", 
   "-- marginTop, marginBottom, marginLeft and marginRight formats have been renamed to paragraphSpaceBefore, paragraphSpaceAfter, paragraphStartIndent and paragraphEndIndent respectively", 
   "-- paragraphStartIndent and paragraphEndIndent are direction-sensitive. For example, the former applies to the paragraph's left edge for left-to-right text, and to the right edge otherwise", 
   "-- These formats now inherit values from parent flow element if undefined during cascade", 
   "-- The previous names continue to be supported on import of FXG markup (but not TLF markup). FXG export uses the new names.", 
   "* UndoManager and IUndoManager moved from flashx.textLayout.edit into flashx.undo namespace (actually done in build 436)",

   "To make RichText more lightweight, it now uses the same technique as RichEditableText2 for its TLF hostFormat. In particular, it uses an object which is not actually a TextLayoutFormat, but instead simply implements ITextLayoutFormat by pulling the format properties directly from the component's CSS styles using getStyle(). This object is now implemented in a new CSSTextLayoutFormat class. It is smaller because it has only one var (for the object to call getStyle() on) rather than a var for every format property.", 
   "Also, the code in SimpleText, RichText, and RichEditableText2 for handling embedded fonts is now more uniform; all three classes use an identical getEmbeddedFontContext() method, which can eventually be factored into a base class or utility class after we determine the constellation of text classes that we'll ship with. I also made this code more efficient by using only a static instance of EmbeddedFont and TextFormat.",
