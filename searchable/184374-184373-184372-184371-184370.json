   "New feature to allow portlets to control whether the portlet and decorator is viewed", 
   "This required a new method on the Portlet interface, getAllowView(RunData)", 
   "This new method better fills out the obsoleting api; for some reason 'view' was missing from the interface", 
   "where as 'edit' and 'info' were there. Perhaps a more general solution would mirror the Portlet API", 
   "and make the modes and states parameterized",
