   "TUSCANY-3553 - add the SCA spec schema to the system contribution so that users can use SCA schema in property types. I don't know why people would want to do that but this capability seems to be the intention of the spec. This slows down the loading of any contributions that use these types, as the schema are loaded, but has little affect if you don't. I'm still looking at whether the local scheme optimization I added is effective but decided to check in as this fault is stopping the otests from running properly currently."
