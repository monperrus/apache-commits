   "If an element cannot be found in the schema for its namespace, it is also searched in the empty namespace to see if the user mistakenly forgot about undefining the default namespace; in this case a better error report is generated and (if schema processing is allowed to continue) the empty namespace definition is taken. However, even if the empty namespace definition didn't pass a few checks, we ended up silently using it -> we changed the namespace of the element without notifying the user (XERCESC-1819)"
