   "Commit retry... [modem woes, I guess.]", 
   "1) Moved 'run stuff' to it's own directory (to work on splitting out context from model in tree).", 
   "2) Consolidated some pages (to not waste links up top of pages) and not give practically empty pages.", 
   "3) Renamed debug.py (the script to update and build) to redo.py. Can't think of a really good name for those two actions.", 
   "4) Get gumpy.py to delete *.pyc for us (prior to CVS update)", 
   "5) Restored 'timeout' to lanching (lost it when went 'threadsafe'), prior to adding support for 'process groups' (to kill children). Removed 'timeout.c' usage.", 
   "6) Removed obsolete check for pgrep, no longer used."
