   "A patch so that the test plugin can use the test classes directory -  rather than just the test source code directory - for searching for unit test cases to run.", 
   "The default behaviour remains unchanged - however this new feature allows other languages which compile down to bytecode - like Groovy - to be used and found by the default unit test run.", 
   "This mechanism could also be useful if other test classes are copied or code generated into the target/test-classes directory etc."
