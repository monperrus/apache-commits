   "Applied patch for OFBIZ-6522: Potential IndexOutOfBoundsException in CategoryServices.getProductCategoryAndLimitedMembers.", 
   "If view indexes as input parameters of service getProductCategoryAndLimitedMembers get manipulated (e.g. by manipulating URL params or bookmarking an URL with those params and come back later), it can lead to an IndexOutOfBoundsException because of a lowIndex greater list size. The highIndex is checked for that, the lowIndex is not.", 
   "Thanks Martin Becker for reporting the issue and providing the patch."
