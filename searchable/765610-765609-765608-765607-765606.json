   "QPID-1813/QPID-1817 : Removed the new properties from the test-provider as this will affect all tests. The NoLocalAfterRecoveryTest now updates a ConnectionURL based on the JNDI data and uses that to start a connection. NLART also provides a default location for the derbyDB store as the DMS class does not correctly attempt to put the store in QPID_WORK. This will be re-addressed when ServerConfiguration is again available from a VHC object. ConnectionTest was updated to remove the literal values for the BrokerDetail options."
