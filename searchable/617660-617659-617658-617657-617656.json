   "GERONIMO-3764 DeployerReaper fails to cleanup the temp directories left behind by deployer", 
   "o Offline deployer leaves temporary files behind since using URLs with \"jar\" protocol locks the jar file and prevents deletion.  This is prevented by creating a temporary file when the protocol is \"jar\".", 
   "o This behaviour is controlled using a system property \"org.apache.geronimo.deployment.util.DeploymentUtil.jarUrlRewrite\" which is false by default, meaning no change from existing behavior for online-deployer.", 
   "o Offline deployer sets the system property to true.", 
   "o See http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@geronimo.apache.org/msg55811.html"
