   "- InactivityMonitor : Better syncronization so that an inactivty exception is only raised once.", 
   "- Connection: Added serviceExceptionAsync() method and change all methods that are dispatching to use this instead of serviceException() to avoid possible deadlock that can occur during connection shutdown.", 
   "- MockTransport: finer grained sychonization to avoid deadlocks.", 
   "- PrefetchSubscription: it is possible it will get duplicate acks on a failover reconnect"
