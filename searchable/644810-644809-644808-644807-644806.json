   "Patch from Ted Ross (see QPID-902): This patch contains the following improvements for management:\\n1) Schema display cleaned up in the python mgmt-cli\\n2) Locking added automatically to management object accessors (manual locking removed from broker/Queue.cpp)\\n3) Schemas are now pre-registered with the management agent using a package initializer. This allows management consoles to get schema information for a class even if no instances of the class exist."
