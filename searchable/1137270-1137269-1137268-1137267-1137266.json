   "River-142  Slightly different to the original patch, this commit fixes delayed garbage collection synchronization issues by processing expired leases immediately, without locking the entire object table.  Lease has been changed to be responsible for expiry,  notification and processing (on the garbage collection thread),  synchronized internally.  A Lease in the object table must now be replaced once it expires and cannot be renewed, it is removed from the table after it is marked expired, to prevent garbage collection of potentially active leases.  Internal classes have been separated from ObjectTable and BasicExportTable to encapsulate or simplify synchronization and locking.  Target is now more faithful to Exporter.unexport's documented behaviour and interrupts dispatched method calls when force is true when possible.", 
   "I wasn't able to create a test to simulate the original failure condition, to do so requires a large number of leases to be processed (to create a time window to process garbage collection of leases after releasing the table lock) and proper timing of dirty calls, garbage collection and clean calls.  The new code processes the lease immediately and isn't subject to the time window."
