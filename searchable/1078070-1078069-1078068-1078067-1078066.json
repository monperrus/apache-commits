   "Removed array after $authMechs ($affilValFunc, $affilValFuncArgs, $addUserFunc, $addUserFuncArgs, $updateUserFunc, $updateUserFuncArgs) and replaced with some code that automatically generates the arrays.  Entries still need to be manually created for shibboleth only authentication affiliations in the $addUserFunc array. Instructions about that are included."
