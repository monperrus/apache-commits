   "Restructure perl_get_realm_hash() as per perl_parse_require_line() in r1539414/1539487, fixing the test for ab->cb2 and correcting the early return values (we should probably return AUTH_USER_NOT_FOUND in the case that ab->cb2 is NULL since that's currently expected behaviour, but we think AUTH_GENERAL_ERROR is wiser for now so as not to let on that we have a realm hash function; the latter is also correct in the unexpected case that ab is NULL, and will also be correct for the case that ab->cb2 is NULL in the future if PerlAddAuthnProvider ever supports an optional second handler).",
