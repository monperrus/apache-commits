   "Replaced fullNameOfLoggerClass string with callerStackBoundaryDeclaringType. This allows us to perform a more accurate and more performant lookup of the caller location information for a logging event. It also fixes an issue with looking up the location information when using an extension."

   "The TextWriterAppender.PrepareWriter method is called for each message logged if the Writer has not been set.", 
   "FileAppender uses PrepareWriter to attempt to open the file for each message rather than just once at configuration. Once the file has been opened a write lock is held.", 
   "RollingFileAppender moves files before deleting them as this reduces the number of situations where a file cannot be rolled."
