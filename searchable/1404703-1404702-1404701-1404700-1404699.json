   "Remove a redundant and wrong scan_addition call from the move-update editor.", 
   "Before this commit, the editor driver was obtaining the copyfrom revision", 
   "of a moved-away file with scan_addition, which won't return the correct", 
   "result for files which were replaced after being moved. Instead, assume", 
   "the revision of the move op-root, which will be correct unless the user", 
   "runs 'svn move --allow-mixed-revisions'. This is fine since we're currently", 
   "working under the assumption that only single-rev move tree-conflicts will", 
   "be resolvable automatically in Subversion 1.8.", 
   "The driver also verified whether the file does exist in the move destination", 
   "as per scan_addition(), which is a redundant check since the file must be", 
   "part of the move by definition.",
