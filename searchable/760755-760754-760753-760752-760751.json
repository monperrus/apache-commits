   "- PortletWindows are now created even if no corresponding Portlet(Definition) exists, but with status invalid", 
   "This makes resolving and handling these kind of errors much easier and efficient (no more multiple errors/exceptions logged, just one etc.)", 
   "- Errors concerning invalid PortletWindow (PortletDefinition not found) are now logged as a single error message, no longer repeated stacktraces", 
   "- Hardened and simplified invalid PortletWindow handling in JPT", 
   "- Fixed PortletAggregatorImpl: Desktop is working again", 
   "- PortletWindow title is now only stored and access from PortletContent", 
   "DynamicWindowTitleService as used to be required by Pluto 1.0 is now completely removed from the codebase", 
   "- ContentDispatcher and ContentDispatcherCtrl already were \"empty\" shells, now completely removed from the codebase", 
   "- Lots of code cleanup in Aggregator classes (Generics, obsolete methods removed, formatting, etc.)", 
   "- Updated demo content.psml and fileserver.psml: replaced demo::ContentViewer to j2-admin::ContentViewer"
