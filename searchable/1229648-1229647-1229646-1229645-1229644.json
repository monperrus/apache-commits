   "Added the enforcer plugin to ensure the build is running with Maven3.  Unfortunately there is an error in the checkstyles for the myfaces master-pom min checkstyle settings.  As such, I've had to provide a custom checkstyle set in order to compile the examples.  In Maven2, the checkstyle plugin fails to find the appropriate checkstyle file, in Maven3 everything resolves correctly.  Therefore, the enforcer will ensure that we are using Maven3 to build."
