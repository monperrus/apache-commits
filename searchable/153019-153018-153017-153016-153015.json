   "Updated the Kerberos protocol to return explanatory recovery information after a request failure.  By default the Linux krb5 libs will not attempt pre-authentication until they receive a KRB_ERROR noting that pre-authentication is required as well as the preferred encryption types.  Pre-authentication now works with Linux kerberos tools, console logins, and services such as SSHD.  Tested on Fedora Core 2 and 3."
