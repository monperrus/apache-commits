   "Improved the transport test kit to allow testing the transport listener by sending messages through the corresponding transport sender. This allows to build unit tests that check the interoperability between senders and listeners. Implemented these tests for the JMS, VFS and HTTP transports. This provides regression tests for the JMS transport bugs corrected in revisions 680021 and 680023."
