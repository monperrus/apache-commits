   "More rework on the XOP/MTOM support:", 
   "* Defined a proper extension interface for XMLStreamWriter that allows serialization code to submit binary content (as DataHandler or DataHandlerProvider).", 
   "* Added an XOPEncodingStreamWriter class that implements the extension and that handles the XOP encoding.", 
   "* Changed MTOMXMLStreamWriter to use XOPEncodingStreamWriter. The XOPEncodingStreamWriter is configured to apply the settings defined in OMOutputFormat, in particular the MTOM threshold.", 
   "* Added utility methods that fall back to base64 if the XMLStreamWriter doesn't support the extension.", 
   "Result: MTOM is now completely transparent to serialization code. The code simply submits the binary content and lets the stream writer decide what to do with it (encode it as base64 or using xop:Include).", 
   "Also modified OMTextImpl and TextNodeImpl to use this new facility. This greatly simplifies the code in these classes. The change also improves consistency: e.g. DOOM's TextNodeImpl didn't check MTOM thresholds.", 
   "Successfully tested the change for non regression with Axis2 trunk."
