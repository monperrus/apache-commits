   "Several fixes and enhancements to the return process: now a return shipment is automatically created when the return is approved, and when the return is completed an invoice is also created. Added new entity to associate a return item with a shipment.", 
   "Several small enhancements to the ui to link returns with shipments and inventory receipts.", 
   "Still, a lot of works needs to be done in this area (e.g. manual creation of return shipments, improve the ui, verify the code that creates the invoice for the return, verify the code that apply payments to invoices etc...)"
