   "HADOOP-4305. Improves the blacklisting strategy, whereby, tasktrackers that are blacklisted are not given tasks to run from other jobs, subject to the following conditions (all must be met): 1) The TaskTracker has been blacklisted by at least 4 jobs (configurable) 2) The TaskTracker has been blacklisted 50% more number of times than the average (configurable) 3) The cluster has less than 50% trackers blacklisted.  Once in 24 hours, a TaskTracker blacklisted for all jobs is given a chance. Restarting the TaskTracker moves it out of the blacklist. Contributed by Amareshwari Sriramadasu."
