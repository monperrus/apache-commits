   "A rather important refactoring of service related code:", 
   "* new factory interface for LocalDispatcher objects", 
   "* new factory implementation of GenericDispatcher", 
   "* new ServiceContainer container that initializes the factory (based on a configuration parameter)", 
   "* moved the getLocalDispatcher method out of GenericDispatcher and refactored (in a thread safe way) into ServiceContainer/GenericDispatcherFactory", 
   "* ServiceContainer also maintains the cache of LocalDispatchers that was managed by GenericDispatcher", 
   "* added code to ServiceContainer to deregister LocalDispatchers at shutdown: this finally fix the current code that was broken because the thread pool maintained by the JobPoller was never closed because of an issue with LocalDispatchers not being deregistered when not started by the ContextFilter", 
   "* change all code to call the ServiceContainer rather than GenericContainer to get a LocalDispatcher: now the implementation is no more directly referenced by calling code"
