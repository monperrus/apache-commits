   "This has two changes: one is adding index to IItemRenderer and the other is adding handleHighlightBackground to ItemRenderer.  Adding an index property should speed things up a little bit, and it'll help fix a bug with renderers that have index-dependent drawing, like when alternatingItemColors is set.  handleHighlightBackground is a new shortcut property that will automatically handle drawing the background for selection/highlight in an item renderer.  For now, handleHighlightBackground defaults to false, so it shouldn\u2019t affect anything.", 
   "The two new properties still need to be PARBed, and the handleHighlightBackround property in particular may change names and default values.", 
   "QE notes: We'll need to add new tests for this", 
   "Doc notes: We'll need some new documentation around the handleHighlightBackground property and the suggested approach for custom item renderers.",
