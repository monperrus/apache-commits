   "The test \"testDurSubSameMessageSelector\" fails when run against the cpp.noprefetch profile as the queue depth check is fails for the following reason. The test sends 5 matching and non matching messages to the queue alternatively. Since the C++ broker does not implement selectors all 10 messages are in the queue. When run with the noprefetch profile, messages are fetched one at a time. Therefore when the last matching message is read, there is still one more message (one that does not match) left in the queue. Therefore the queue depth check needs to take this into account."
