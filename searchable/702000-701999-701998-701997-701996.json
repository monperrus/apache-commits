   "Work in progress. Started to clean up cross-bundle dependencies on ContributionService implementation class, the various CompositeBuilder implementation classes and the ContributionDependencyBuilder implementation class. Added extension points for ContributionBuilders and CompositeBuilders to have them discovered and loaded by the Equinox ServiceDiscovery like other extension points. Moved injection of monitors and SCA definitions to the build methods instead of the constructors to remove references to these implementation constructors. Simplified NodeImpl a bit to remove references to other runtime implementation classes."
