   "Insidious bug in Base64 that was in essence nullifying isArrayByteBase64 by discarding non-base64 content along with whitespace.  The lesson to learn here is that if you name a function 'discardWhitespace' stick to that name, don't exceed the name of the function.  The only reason we found this bug was because of Clover."
