   "Moved the \"birt\" component out of framework to specialpurpose; moved all the birt reports from the applications to the birt component itself, where the application webapps are overriden to inject the reports; the end result is the same but since all these birt reports are simply a proof of concepts that cannot be used in production (for example they use hardcoded userlogin for authentication) the birt component should be probably disabled by default (but this will be discussed in the dev list).", 
   "Now it will be very easy to extract the birt component (for OFBiz Extras) or to disable it when deploying to production or when interested in sparing some hardware resources. I did some cursory tests but since the work has been challenging and rather complex I would appreciate testing help and also reviews to finds chunks of code that I could have missed and that could be moved out as well."
