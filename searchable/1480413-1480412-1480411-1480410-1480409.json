   "2) I noticed that some of the projects have drivers or main classes which I assume a lot of folks are able to and plan to run pipelines directly from individual projects.  If this is true, then I think it is actually easier to leave it as is and default to have the corresponding -res dependency in the pom.xml.  Since it's maven controlled now, an external app can always add  <exclude ctakes-drug-ner-res/>.  This is just based on observation--  otherwise, each project will need to think about *-res during runtime if it's not in the pom.xml"
