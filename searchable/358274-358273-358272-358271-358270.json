   "1. Updated the codegenerator not to generate seperate classes for databind supporters", 
   "Now the fromOM and toOm methods are generated inside the stub (or the MessageReceiver). The templates  for databind supporters are included inside the main template itself until I figure out the API to pump the template from outside.", 
   "2. Added the -w (wrap classes) option to the commandline option list", 
   "3. Fixed several bugs in the JavaBeanWriter.java", 
   "4. removed some unused writers and templates (updated that in the property file as well)", 
   "The generated test classes need to be amended! However the build is fine even with the generated code in security module"
