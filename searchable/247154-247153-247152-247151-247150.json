   "The following changes were necessary to support overloading", 
   "from skeletons.", 
   "1) Changed the Java Skeleton Map to have", 
   "keys=method names and values=List of OperationDesc.", 
   "This used to be values=OperationDesc, so there was no", 
   "way to stored overloaded method names.", 
   "2) Changed the Java Skeleton writer to assign the", 
   "appropriate type QName and type javaType to each", 
   "ParameterDesc.  I added a new constructor to ParameterDesc", 
   "to simplify the generation.", 
   "3) Changed ServiceDesc code that reads the skeleton's", 
   "OperationDesc objects to conform to the new HashMap changes.", 
   "Also made some minor changes to the parameter processing", 
   "to use the existing javaType (if set).", 
   "4) Changed the roundtrip test case to once again use", 
   "skeletonDeploy.",
