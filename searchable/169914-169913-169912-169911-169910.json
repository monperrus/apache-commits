   "1. remove sanity debug code in RawStore to not write bootpassword in plain text into the service.properties 2. currently the test harness does not seem to pass on the encryption related properties to the MultiTest and with change in #1, encryption wont be used for stress.multi. So changes made to  RunTest to pass on the encryption, testEncryptionAlgorithm values to the MultiTest harness. Also changed mtTestCase to recognize the encryption properties and modify the database url to use for the MultiTest.",
