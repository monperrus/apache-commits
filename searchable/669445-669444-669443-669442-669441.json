   "As I'm using rc.ofbiz I 1st thought it was related to the change I commit here, but it did not fix the issue. Then I tried to launch using startofbiz.bat on my dev machine : same problem but in French. I have tried ant clean-all then ant run-install on both (svn st ok), no way.", 
   "Anyway I think it's needed in release4.0 so I commit the change. I give up for now, no more time to spend on this issue..."
