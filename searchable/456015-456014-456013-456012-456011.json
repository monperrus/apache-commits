   "Added modelChanged() method to Component which is called when setModel() or", 
   "setModelObject() are called.  This method calls onModelChanged() to allow", 
   "subclasses to respond to model changes.  Changed Form to handle onModelChanged()", 
   "by calling the onModelChanged() method of each contained FormComponent that", 
   "uses the same root model as the form, as determined by the new sameRootModel()", 
   "method in Component (which uses the INestedModel interface to look inside", 
   "compound models such as PropertyModel and StringResourceModel to find the", 
   "root model).  The call to FormComponent.onModelChanged() resets any invalid", 
   "state information from user editing since the model must now be correct by", 
   "definition.  For example, AbstractTextComponent overrides onModelChanged()", 
   "and calls onValid() to reset its invalidInput memory."
