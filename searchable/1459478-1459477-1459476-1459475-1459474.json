   "[HBASE-8113] Bring back the seek+read functionality to Pluto.", 
   "Author: manukranthk", 
   "Summary: It was observed that the seek + read gives better performance than pread when performing relatively large scans(scan which cannot be cached). Hence reverting [HBASE-7408] Removes the pread/seek+read option and defaults it to pread(D661385). Currently this feature is intended to be used only with the ClientSideScan(D708638). This can be potentially made configurable in the future.",
