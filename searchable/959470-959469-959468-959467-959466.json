   "Some work on the entity engine:", 
   "1. Removed the conversion framework from the entity engine. Type conversions should be done higher up in the stack. The basic pattern is the same, but instead of each ModelFieldType containing a converter instance, it now contains a JdbcValueHandler instance. The JdbcValueHandler performs the same task as the original switch statement - in effect each ModelFieldType contains its own piece of the switch statement.", 
   "2. Added two new field types: byte[] and Object. Originally, the Blob field type was a catch-all for multiple Java data types. This change disambiguates the field's contents.", 
   "This has been tested on Advantage, Derby, and MySQL. It should be completely backward compatible. I will be monitoring the dev mailing list closely for any problems."
