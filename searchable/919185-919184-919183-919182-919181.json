   "[bundlerepository] fix uri handling which incorrectly change urls for uris which aren't really specified.One problem i found was when parsing some license headers which aren't actually considered URIs, such as the BND one which looks like:   ASL20;name=\"This material is licensed under the Apache Software License, Version 2.0\"; url=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\";distribution=repo The solution is to let the user deal with URI unless the type is actually specified (and for the main resource URI)."
