   "Added a TraX liaison for the <style> task.  This enables Apache's Xalan2", 
   "and Sun's JAXP1.1 implementations to be used.", 
   "I don't expect many developers to have multiple XSLT implementations in", 
   "their classpath, but if they do, I made the TraX liaison the default", 
   "for several reasons:", 
   "1) It is standard", 
   "2) It is the most modern interface", 
   "3) It is designed as an pluggable interface, so in theory (though perhaps", 
   "down the road a bit), it should be the only liaison required."
