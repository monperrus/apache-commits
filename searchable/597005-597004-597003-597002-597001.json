   "While looking at dynamic class loading, I noticed that we create a separate MappingRepository when doing an in-process schema redefinion. This seems to lead to potentially-out-of-sync states in the main configuration MappingRepository; this change shares the Configuration's repository with the MappingTool.", 
   "It looks like the old behavior was somewhat implicit, so I'm hoping that it wasn't necessary, and that this change will be a step forward."
