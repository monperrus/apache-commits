   "The following changes are made to improve", 
   "the extensibility processing of the xsd:any element.", 
   "1) The xsd:any element was being mapped to the xsd:anytype.", 
   "I don't think that this duel use is appropriate.", 
   "Introduced a new XSD_ANY type that maps to java.lang.Object", 
   "and automatically uses the ElementSerializer/ElementDeserializer.", 
   "a) Got rid of the special typemapping registered in", 
   "test/wsdl/extensibility/deploy.wsdd.  No longer needed.", 
   "2) Changed SchemaUtils to use the new XSD_ANY type when an", 
   "xsd:any is identified.  Also sets a flag on the ElementDecl", 
   "to indicate that this ElementDecl is a result of xsd:any.", 
   "3) Changed the symbol table to put an XSD_ANY in the symbol", 
   "table when an xsd:any is encountered.", 
   "4) If an XSD_ANY is referenced, then all complex types are", 
   "generated and deployed (just like the XSD_ANYTYPE case).",
