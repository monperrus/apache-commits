   "Enhancement: UserDatabase interface includes two new methods: getWikiNames() for enumerating the users in the current database, and deleteByLoginName( String ), for removing users. I have implemented these methods to the concrete classes JDBCUserDatabase and XMLUserDatabase. Thanks to Frank Fischer for his patches; they served as the basis for these changes. I have *not* added convenience methods to UserManager... yet."
