   "appender named \"LOGFILE\".  The CONSOLE appender will ignore logging below", 
   "the FATAL threshold (consistent with original use).  The LOGFILE appender", 
   "is not used by default.  If enabled, it captures INFO message or higher.", 
   "The properties file can now be easily modified to capture DEBUG messages",

   "console...", 
   "3.  attachments/MimeUtils.java: minor changes to comments that allowed", 
   "Rational Rose to reverse engineer this file...", 
   "4.  New file TestSrcContent.java.  This is a generic test tool that looks", 
   "for strings to \"avoid\" in the content of the source tree.  It is based on", 
   "TestMessages.java.  Currently it only checks for \"org.apache.log4j\" (which", 
   "covers imports or other references to the package or classes in the", 
   "package).  In the future we might consider adding \"System.out.println\" to", 
   "that...", 
   "5. Added the commons-logging.jar file and license."
