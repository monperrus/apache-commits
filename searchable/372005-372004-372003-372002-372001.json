   "Following the model of Graphics2DAdapter, added a new interface ImageAdapter which can optionally be implemented by Renderers to support painting of RenderedImage or BufferedImage instances from inside XMLHandler implementations. First implementation by the PSRenderer. Barcode4J is going to be extended to use this interface so barcode support can easily be added to the AFP Renderer without having a Graphics2D implementation at first."
