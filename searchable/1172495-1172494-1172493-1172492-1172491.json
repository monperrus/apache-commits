   "back ported path enhancements for Lucene.Net.Tests assembly to fix failing tests under TestBackwardsComptability for indexes.                                                                                            TestEquatableList/System_String_GetHashCode_Exhibits_Inconsistent_Inequality_For_Some_strings fails when it runs under a 64 bit process. It passes when it runs under x86 which is the default for nunit runners.                                                                                                      Test_Search_FieldDoc fails for the wrong reason under Gallio due to a permissions issue & serialization. Created a new exception to explicitly test for the bug it was meant to test for.  Though the security permissions & serialization will probably need to be revisited."
