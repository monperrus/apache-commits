   "TUSCANY-4011 - stop the SCDL callback binding configuration from being overwritten. The JMS binding strangely relied on this so required some surgery. I've also simplified CallbackServiceReference and added a CALLBACK message header and CallbackHandler object to make is simpler to pass the callback address down the message chain. The existing approach of creating a CallbackEndpoint model is still supported at the moment."
