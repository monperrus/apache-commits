   "Added a release() method on MessageExchange to allow the mex to clean the resources they're holding (mostly dao stuff). The in-mem DAOs are now being cleaned up properly once the instance has finished its execution and the mex have been released so that the GC can do its job. Otherwise all in-mem DAOs are just one big memory leak."
