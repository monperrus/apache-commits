   "Bug fix: PermissionTag didn't recognize the new root-like AllPermission. It now accepts it as an argument to the \"permission\" attribute (the first letter is lowercase). Thus, <wiki:Permission permission=\"allPermission\"> will evaluate the tag body if the current user posseses AllPermission for the wiki; if not, the contents will be skipped. Credit: Terry Steichen"
