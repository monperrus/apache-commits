   "Simplified and improved the logic to setup the Tomcat connectors: the logic was overly complex and messed up (probably after all the various upgrades to new Tomcat versions), there were a series of parameters that could not be set, some hardcoded values, some old and no more used (by Tomcat) parameters.", 
   "Improved the information logged about the actual parameters set for the connectors.", 
   "Removed Javolution from CatalinaContainer.", 
   "Cleaned up the connector configuration file: removed no more used parameters, commented out some parameters (that didn't change the default), commented out some parameters in order to use the Tomcat default values that may improve the performance (e.g. maxThreads in OFBiz was set to a lower value than the default one of newer Tomcat releases and this limits the throughput in default OFBiz setups), updated URLs to Tomcat documentation."
