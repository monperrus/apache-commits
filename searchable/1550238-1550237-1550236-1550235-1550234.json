   "[0.89-fb][HBASE-10109] Balance #regions/RS better when creating new table", 
   "Author: adela", 
   "Summary:", 
   "When a new table is created we place the primary locations for", 
   "the regions in a round robin fashion. Because we do this for every newly", 
   "created table it is possible that some regionservers end up with more", 
   "regions than the others and if there are more tables in the cluster the", 
   "difference between a min and max #regions per RS can be larger.", 
   "One small optimization is to sort the RS in ascending order before", 
   "assigning them regions.", 
   "Test Plan: wrote unit test: TestRegionPlacement.testPrimaryPlacement",
