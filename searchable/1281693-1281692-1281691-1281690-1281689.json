   "Set estimated sizes on the renderers based on column width, and use validateClient instead of validateNow so the renderer will use the new estimated size.  This fixes a bug where a long string might measure quite differently from its typical item.  The new layout logic requires that estimated sizes be accurate enough that measurements won't vary too much from actual layout size",
