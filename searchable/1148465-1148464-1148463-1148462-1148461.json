   "Progress on client side support for saving user preferences (RAVE-27) -- this adds an edit prefs button to the title bar and adds the code to dynamically generate the form fields for editing prefs.  Currently clicking save/cancel just closes the edit prefs interface -- the next commit should include the last bit which is persisting the prefs and re-rendering the widget.  I also simplified the metadata object that the OpenSocialWidgetRenderer adds to the widget object so that it is something that can more easily be represented for Wookie widgets as well (at least the userPrefs bit) so that we can work with userPrefs for them too.",
