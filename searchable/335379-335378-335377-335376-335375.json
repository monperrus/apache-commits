   "Fixes inspired by bugzilla bug 2308 (http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2308).  The maximum number of DTMs is calculated based on the number of bits left over for the DTM number.  The m_dtms array is allocated only at this length to avoid generating a DTMId greater than the maximum available.  I changed a sign-extended shift to a non-sign-extended shift to allow access to the upper have of the DTMId range.  Also changed the -1 ^ x syntax to ~x which I find much more understandable."
