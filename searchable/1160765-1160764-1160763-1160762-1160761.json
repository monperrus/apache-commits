   "VCL-503", 
   "Added code to util.pm::run_ssh_command to allow a timeout value to be specified in order to prevent hung SSH processes from hanging for a very long time or indefinitely. The default value for now is 0 meaning that the code never times out the command.", 
   "Added utils.pm kill_child_processes subroutine. If the run_ssh_command timeout value is reached, the SSH process is still running so the kill_child_processes subroutine is called to kill all child processes belonging to the reservation process.", 
   "Added timeout_seconds argument set to 15 seconds to the run_ssh_command call in OS.pm::is_ssh_responding. Also added 20 second timeout argument to the call to execute qwinsta.exe in Windows.pm::user_logged_in. These calls cause an SSH process to hang most often.", 
   "VCL-465", 
   "Updated OS.pm::get_public_interface_name to ignore interfaces named 'lo' and 'sit[0-9]'. Changed logic to not ignore interfaces without a bound IP address. This fixes problems where static addresses are being assigned under Linux. The correct public interface does not come up with an autogenerated IP address as it does under Windows and the code was ignoring this interface because of this.", 
   "Other", 
   "Updated OS.pm::create_text_file to correct the line endings depending on the OS type."
