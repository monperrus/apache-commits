   "[HBASE-5474] Share the multiput thread pool for all the HTable instance", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Currently, each HTable instance will have a thread pool for the multiput", 
   "operation. Each thread pool is actually a cached thread pool, which is", 
   "bounded", 
   "the number of region server. So the maximum number of threads will be (", 
   "server * # htable instance). On the other hand, if all HTable instance", 
   "could",

   "However,", 
   "it will increase the thread pool efficiency.", 
   "Also the single put requests are processed within the current thread", 
   "instead of", 
   "the thread pool.", 
   "Test Plan: run all the unit tests and test it with HBaseLoad test as",
