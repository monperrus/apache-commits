   "bug 4304: in some setups, eg where a plugin implements 'spamd_child_init' with a long-running task, it's possible for child spamd processes to take too long to exit when the parent spamd is killed with SIGINT or SIGTERM.  if the caller then starts a new spamd immediately, it will die with 'address already in use', since the old children are still running.  Fix this race by unblocking the signals as soon as possible in child spamds after they are forked, and before calling the plugin hook; also add test cases"
