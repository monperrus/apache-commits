   "ODE-39 The JNDI usage has been cleaned up. There's still an issue with the transaction manager though, we'll have to use explicit factories to create the initial context so that JOTM doesn't get in the way. And as long as Geronimo won't have a Transaction Manager accessible through JNDI, that won't be possible... Maybe Spring could help though."
