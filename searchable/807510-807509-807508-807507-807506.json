   "Delay processing of initial RMR payload sent from container to gadget. This payload includes an ACK, which signals the gadget to ACK back to the container to complete the handshake. This second ACK was failing, however, due to the fact that the return relay is appended only when document.body exists - onload in the gadget. Thus the process call needs to wait for the return frame to be appended. This makes RMR much more robust to timing issues and hopefully should fix most problems seen with it."
