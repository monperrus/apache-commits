   "Applied patch from jira issue OFBIZ-4267. Disabled attribute for lookup field should be readonly.", 
   "Lookup tag has a attribute \"disabled\" that is used to set disabled=\"disabled\" property for lookup input element and it create also a clear button just after lookup field to clear the field value.", 
   "But if we set disabled=\"disabled\" for any input field then that field does not passes as parameter and we can't accesses it from parameters or request parameters , so it should be \"readonly\".", 
   "If we set readonly-\"readonly\" then user can't change the field value directly, and this field passes as parameters.", 
   "Only difference between readonly and disabled is that in case of disabled field does not passes as parameter buy in case of readonly field passes as a parameter.", 
   "Thanks Deepak for the contribution."
