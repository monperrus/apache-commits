   "Add a String property on the sparse composite that will be included as part of the uniqueness of the client-side Service instance.  This can be used to attach unique configurations (such as policy set) to different instances of the same WSDL Service injected on the client if each service uses a different service ref name for example.  Add associated TDD test also."
