   "fix spamd prefork race condition; if the lowest idle child died or exited while still in the I state, the master spamd would still attempt to assign it tasks and get stuck in an infinite loop trying to write the 'accept' order to the dead child.  avoid this by recomputing the lowest idle child in the signal handler.   also, add some error-handling code to remove out-of-control children from the backchannel's list of kids, on prefork state error."
