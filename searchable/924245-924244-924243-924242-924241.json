   "Fixing JIRA Issue #1248: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1248. Eliminating a static field which was holding on to a text node for mutation notifications. This was not thread-safe and could lead to a memory leak. Fixed thanks to the patch by Ludger B\u00fcnger (which I modified slightly; setting the value field on TextImpl directly instead of calling setNodeValueInternal())."
