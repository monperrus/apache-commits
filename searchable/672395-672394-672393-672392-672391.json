   "Cleaned up gadgets.rpc library implementation, and implemented fast IE transport layer.", 
   "Credit:", 
   "Joseph Schorr (jschorr@google.com) and I implemented this together, but he", 
   "really did all the hard work, as well as developing the NIX technique's", 
   "fundamentals. Huge thanks to Joseph!", 
   "Details:", 
   "* Created a new relayChannel for Firefox frameElement technique,", 
   "making its implementation more linear to read.", 
   "* Consolidated all transport-specific code in setupChannel(), setupFrame(),", 
   "and callX(), where X = relay type. This refactoring makes setup and use", 
   "of each transport more clear, and makes it possible in later revisions", 
   "to separate out each method as its own class. In theory, if we can trust", 
   "things like User-Agent headers, we can use this to reduce rpc.js code", 
   "size significantly by only including the needed transport(s).", 
   "* Implemented \"NIX\" - Native IE XDC. This method exploits the fact", 
   "that in IE6 and IE7 the window.opener property can be both set and", 
   "read across domain boundaries for an IFRAME, and that any object", 
   "can be passed through it. In particular, functions implementing", 
   "message passing can be passed. These can't be JS functions, however,", 
   "since those can leak sender context. So, VBScript (COM) objects", 
   "wrapping these are passed to maintain context isolation.", 
   "- Requires for IE6/7 that rpc.js be included in the container", 
   "at load time, not dynamically. TODO added to consider detecting", 
   "whether dynamic loading is happening (at which point we should", 
   "fall back to IFPC).", 
   "- Message channel handshake *and* message passing validated", 
   "using authToken, as with other channels.", 
   "- Impl requires that gadget call container first - else IFPC", 
   "is used. This is the same as the frameElement technique. We", 
   "could add a setInterval()-based initialization routine later", 
   "if needed. To date, the only gadgets.rpc calls made from", 
   "container to gadget without gadget to container first are", 
   "in theory pubsub messages.", 
   "- Extensive documentation on this technique and the others", 
   "added to the comments, since they're stripped out in the", 
   "majority case.", 
   "* Implemented quick-and-dirty performance testing page verifying", 
   "the library works and giving basic performance metrics.", 
   "This needs to be improved! But does the trick for now...", 
   "Testing/Data:", 
   "Library verified on the following browsers with the RPC test page. For each,", 
   "a \"bandwidth\" measure was taken by averaging the results of 6 G2C and C2G runs", 
   "with 100 messages being passed of 1K apiece. Units are 1K messages/sec.", 
   "The \"latency\" value is the average amount of time taken, over 6 G2C and C2G runs,", 
   "to send 1 1K message. Happily, for all browsers save Safari (soon due to get", 
   "window.postMessage), latency is around or below time required to achieve", 
   "a cross-domain call without user-perceived delay.", 
   "* Firefox 3 (WPM) - bandwidth: 88 kB/sec; latency: 18ms.", 
   "* Firefox 2 (FE)  - bandwidth: 80 kB/sec; latency: 15ms.", 
   "* Opera 9   (WPM) - bandwidth: 85 kB/sec; latency: 7ms.", 
   "* IE6       (NIX) - bandwidth: 64 kB/sec; latency: 18ms.", 
   "* IE7       (NIX) - bandwidth: 64 kB/sec; latency: 22ms.", 
   "* Safari 3 (IFPC) - bandwidth: ?6-8kB/sec; latency: ?100-200ms.", 
   "- Safari is somewhat flaky with the RPC test page, before", 
   "and after the rpc.js change. Multiple messages seem to", 
   "confuse it from time to time."
