   "Deprecated getCurrentTestMethod() and replaced it by getCurrentTestName() which is a better name. In preparation for defining a CactusTestCase interface which will contain the extension to TestCase and that will be implemented by all XXXTestCase (ServletTestCase, etc). The class hierarchy will also be removed in favor of delegates so that we don't have to make the whole hierarchy API-public. In addition that will prevent users using lots of methods they are not even supposed to see such as callBeginMethod(), createConfiguration(), etc."
