   "If a client checks out or updates a tree, a server authz system now", 
   "has the ability to selectively deny read-access on arbitrary files and", 
   "dirs by supplying a authz_read_func to svn_repos_dir_delta().  In this", 
   "situation, dir_delta() will call new absent_[file|dir]() editor", 
   "functions instead of the usual [open|add] functions.  The DAV layer", 
   "now marshals these messages over the network, and libsvn_wc marks the", 
   "appropriate wc entries as 'absent'.  Entries marked 'absent' are", 
   "essentially treated like 'deleted' ones; most client commands can't", 
   "see them at all.  (But 'svn up' *does* report them to the server, in", 
   "case read-access is re-granted.)", 
   "(There are still a couple of small wc bugs, specifically triggered by", 
   "repeated granting/ungranting of read-access to files.  They'll be", 
   "fixed RSN.)", 
   "Final note:  this change upgrades working copies from format 2 to", 
   "format 3 'in place'.  Format 1 wc's are no longer supported."
