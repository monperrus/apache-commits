   "[OFBIZ-6520] When CalculateProductPrice service is called and currency is not passed in IN parameter then, this service picks up default currency from general.properties file which is hard coded to USA. But if some one changes the currency of store, code to return product price does not work. So code should look at ProductStore's defaultCurrencyUomId field first and if that is not set up then code should look for default currency set in general.properties file. This way code to fetch product price will be more database driven. So changing the code accordingly."
