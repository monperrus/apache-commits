   "updating the Planet fetching and updating process for subscriptions to make it more layered and pluggable.  major updates here include ...", 
   "1. Modified FeedFetcher interface to remove old monolithic refreshEntries() method and replace it with just a fetchSubscription(url) method.", 
   "2. Added a new FeedUpdater interface which acts as the feed update processor and utilizes the FeedFetcher in conjunction with the PlanetManager to update all the feed data.  Making this a separate interface allows us to neatly partition logic and provide pluggable implementations based on different updating strategies such as single threaded vs. multi-threaded, etc."
