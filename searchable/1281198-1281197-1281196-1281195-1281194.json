   "- Fixing Binding events properties were using as they were still using the old events rather than the new ones", 
   "- Fixing issues around mute/volume.  Now the video component's definition of mute/volume is the same as Strobe (i.e.-when muted, volume is not neecessarily 0).  However, because of this, extra code had to be added in the VolumeBar and MuteButton to get the user-interaction correct so that when a user clicks on the slider, that automatically unmutes the video.", 
   "- Adding seekToFirstFrame, which needs to be PARBed, but gives us the old video component's behavior when autoPlay = false so that it connects to the server, loads up the first frame, and sizes the video.", 
   "- Fixing up DynamicStreamingVideoSource to have the host property typed as Object instead of a serverURI:String", 
   "- Now I'm exposing mediaPlayerState and videoObject on VideoDisplay and VideoPlayer", 
   "- Fixing a bug where someone clicks on the playPauseButton when no source is loaded and the \"play button\" changes to a \"pause\" when it should just stay as a \"play\" because the video didn't actually start playing.",
