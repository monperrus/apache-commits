   "The type data received off the wire should be used to load a Deserializer.", 
   "However both the BeanDeserializer and ArrayDeserializer were using", 
   "the java class type of the property/array element to construct a Deserializer.", 
   "This works fine if the java class and xml instance data have the same type,", 
   "but does not work at all if the xml instance data is a derived type.", 
   "For example consider a Bean with a property Foo that is an Object.", 
   "The old code would attempt to find a Deserializer for Object when a Foo", 
   "is received off the wire...and fail.  The new code will now use the xml type information", 
   "to determine the Deserializer.", 
   "So I changed the code in the ArrayDeserializer and BeanDeserializer to", 
   "use the xml instance type information to get the Deserializer for contained items.", 
   "This change revealed another problem.  If the contained item has an href, there is no", 
   "type information; thus a generic DeserializerImpl object is used....The href/id", 
   "processing breaks when the DeserializerImpl has value targets.", 
   "Here are some of the additional changes that I made:", 
   "1) Changed the code so that value targets are moved (instead of copied) when", 
   "deserializer fixups are applied.  This is necessary to ensure that only one", 
   "set(..) is invoked per value, and that it is invoked on the correct value.", 
   "This is also a small performance improvement.", 
   "2) For the case of array elements, if an array element definition does not have", 
   "a type attribute, its type can be assumed from the array's arrayType setting.", 
   "Consider the situation where the array has an arrayType of \"Foo[]\", and the", 
   "first element of the array is an href and does not have a type attribute.", 
   "The array deserializer will construct a generic DeserializerImpl for", 
   "the contained array element.  The new setDefaultType(..) method of the", 
   "DeserializerImpl object will be used to indicate that the \"Foo\" deserializer", 
   "should be used if the definition of the array element", 
   "does not have a type attribute.", 
   "3) Changed the roundtrip test to test this new code.", 
   "4) Changed BeanSerializer.writeSchema to use a sequence group instead of", 
   "all group. (Per note from Dave Dunkin)", 
   "(This problem was reported by Thomas Sandholm on axis-user)"
