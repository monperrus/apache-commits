   "1. Added the code from Saliya for the Eclipse TCPMon port (WS-Commons Jira 137 [http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WSCOMMONS-137]). The classes have been refactored to fit the apache packaging and there is still some work to do to get it right since there are a number of classes that can be reused from the existing ones.", 
   "2. Refactored the IDEA components to reflect the same structure as the eclipse one.", 
   "3. Fixed a very minor issue in the original TCPMon window - the tab that should have focus at startup is tab 0 rather than tab 1."
