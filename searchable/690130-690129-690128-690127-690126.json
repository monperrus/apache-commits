   "Merged from Sandesha2/C branch https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/sandesha/tags/sandesha2/c/worker_thread_removed-23may2008. The intention of that branch has been to reinvent sandesha2/C eleminating most of its problems. In doing so it has significantly changed it's thread model. Also database is also used very carefully. Memory leaks problems were also solved greatly. However this keeps the original api unchanged for most of the part."
