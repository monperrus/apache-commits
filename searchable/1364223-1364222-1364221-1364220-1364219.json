   "First pass of a rather relevant cleanup of service related code:", 
   "* removed the support for serviceReaderUrls for local services specified in the WEB-INF folder; this feature was not used in years and OFBiz has better mechanisms to define services in components;", 
   "* as a consequence of the previous point, a lot of code has been cleaned in the DispatchContext class; in this refactoring, I have fixed some non thread safe code (but this is only a first step and this class needs to be enhanced under this aspect)", 
   "* greatly simplified the static instance creator and constructors of ServiceDispatcher and  GenericDispatcher to reflect the changes in DispatchContext but also removed old unused code, simplified code for readability, added some comments to better document it"
