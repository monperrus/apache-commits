   "CreateUrlParam.groovy improvement. The original version had hard-coded parameters for calendar navigation - making it difficult to reuse the calendar screen in other applications. My previous commit removed that restriction, but it introduced bugs in the calendar event edit form. This commit permits applications to specify URL parameters for calendar navigation while preserving backward-compatible behavior."
