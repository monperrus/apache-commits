   "Enhancement: checked in back-end code that removes the restriction on changing login names and user names (\"full names\") after registration. To do this, UserManager emits a new WikiSecurityEvent called PROFILE_NAME_CHANGED that signals when the login name or user name changes. PageManager and GroupManager listen for this event, and will make all appropriate changes to page ACLs and groups that contain the old user name(s). The front-end changes (JSP tweaks) are nearly finished and will be checked in shortly."
