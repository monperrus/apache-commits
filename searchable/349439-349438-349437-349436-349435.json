   "This commit includes new test suites for the ejb and jms system controls. Both suites of tests require that Geronimo (M5 or later) and Cactus are installed on the client system.  Since Geronimo currently does not have a shutdown command it is also required that Geronimo be started and stopped manually instead of automatically by these tests. Once Geronimo has a shutdown command the ant scripts will be modified to include statup and shutdown targets for geronimo.",
