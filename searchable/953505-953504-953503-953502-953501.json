   "Initial check in of replicator that incrementally replicates attachments, so that only attachments that have changed are replicated, and streams attachments, so that buffering for push and pull isn't required. To enable the new replicator, add this to [httpd_global_handlers] in the local.ini file \\n_replicate = {couch_httpd_rep, handle_req}\\n. This isn't robust to dela with common failures, doesn't yet create replica target database when missing, replicate docs by id, or do continuous replication."
