   "BitmapFill and BitmapImage bug fixes", 
   "http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-17477 - only edge pixels expand when resize this bitmapGraphic", 
   "If repeat mode is false, the Player will extend the edge pixels of the bitmap to fill the empty space. The fix is to limit the fill area to the size of the bitmap.", 
   "http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-21980 - BitmapFill repeat property behaves differently than BitmapImage", 
   "If repeat mode is false, the Player will extend the edge pixels of the bitmap to fill the empty space. The fix is to draw the transformed bitmapData into a new bitmapData that is two pixels wider and taller than the source bitmap if repeat is false. There is a caching mechanism that keeps the new bitmapData around unless the source, one of the transform properties or the bounds size have changed.", 
   "There is an additional optimization which only uses the extra bitmapData if it is larger than the bounds or if it has been transformed.", 
   "Unfortunately this means that the BitmapFill will keep around an extra bitmapData object in certain circumstances. This situation will most frequently happen when the bitmap is smaller than the shape being filled and repeat is set to false.",
