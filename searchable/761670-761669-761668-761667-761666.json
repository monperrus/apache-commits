   "QPID-1764 : Update to BaseTransactionLog to create a TestableTransactionLog, which will replace TestableMessageStore. Update to BaseTransactionLog/Test to work correctly with transactions and to fully test that functionality. Updated StoreContext to know when it is in a transaction as relying on a payload being set is not sufficient as that is not set when running with the MessageMemoryStore and so transactional testing in the BTLT was not correct.",
