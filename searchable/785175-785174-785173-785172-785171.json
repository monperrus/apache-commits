   "- ReferenceListProcessor now searches for \"general\" ID first and then wsu:Id, not the other way around...as it should always hit the general ID first", 
   "- I added a boolean to the findElementById method in WSSecurityUtil which controls whether to search the entire message for duplicates or not", 
   "- Message creation functions now do not check for duplicates as this is unnecessary", 
   "- Message processing functions do check for duplicates as before...EnvelopeIdResolver does not, as SignatureProcessor later does check for duplicates", 
   "- This should speed things up a bit....", 
   "- Added a test as well for some signature modification attacks."
