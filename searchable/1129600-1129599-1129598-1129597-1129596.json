   "Add CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org/) support to the JS view server.", 
   "This allows you to write all query server functions in CoffeeScript.", 
   "The implementation re-uses the JS query server and adds an additional,", 
   "optional compilation step. To make the implementation easier for now,", 
   "a new main-coffee.js file is generated that includes the CoffeeScript", 
   "compiler, but I think we can do away with that in a future optimisation", 
   "and just use a single main.js that can handle both.", 
   "The patch includes basic tests for the JS test suite that I tested", 
   "in Firefox and Chrome. I'm no expert in CoffeeScript, so I don't", 
   "know if more complex script will break the implementation. `make", 
   "distcheck` passes.", 
   "Futon picks up the \"coffeescript\" design document lanugage as expected", 
   "and view definition interaction works as usual.", 
   "List functions don't deal well with the implicit return generated by", 
   "CoffeeScript, but J Chris says, this will be easy to fix.", 
   "The patch adds CoffeeScript 1.1.1 which is MIT licensed and updates", 
   "the NOTICE, LICENSE, license.skip and .gitignore files as well as the", 
   "build system accordingly."
