   "Correct a bug in the composition implementation in the case of a component type that contains only optional context entries and no context directive is declared in a block.  Previously this generated a NPE.  The update ensures that a non-null directive is generated and checks for optionality of the entry when processing the meta-model. Version bump on composition-impl and dependent packages."
