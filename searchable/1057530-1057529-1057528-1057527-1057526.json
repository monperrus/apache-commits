   "After the entity-condition element, there's an <if> element, and the iterator is only used when the \"if\" condition is false, i.e. the <else> part is executed.", 
   "My fix is simply to move the <entity-condition>, complete with <use-iterator>, within the <else> element so the condition is evaluated and the iterator created only when the iterator will be used.",
