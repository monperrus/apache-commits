   "When specifying multiple handlers for phases other than the content phase",

   "PythonTransHandler, PythonAuthenHandler, PythonAuthzHandler and", 
   "PythonTypeHandler, as soon as apache.OK is returned, subsequent handlers", 
   "for the phase will be skipped, as the result indicates that any processing",
