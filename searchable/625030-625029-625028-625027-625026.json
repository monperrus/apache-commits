   "Bug fix: changed behavior of AuthorizationManager to prevent privilege escalation with Asserted users. The method AuthorizationManager.hasRoleOrPrincipal() now ALWAYS returns false when the user isn't authenticated, AND the principal/role being queried isn't a built-in role like Anonymous, Asserted etc. Thus, to gain access to pages that name a specific user, that user is now REQUIRED to log in. Ditto for groups he or she belongs to. The exception is for ACLs that contain built-in roles; e.g., \"allow Asserted users to view\" is allowed. Adjusted several unit tests and created a new web unit test to verify."
