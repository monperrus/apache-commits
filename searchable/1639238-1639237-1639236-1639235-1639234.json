The only issue was that the original commit to trunk(subsequent backport to 10.11) changed file java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/ClientResultSet.java which does not exist in 10.10. The corresponding file in 10.10 is java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/ResultSet.java. I have hand done the changes into ResultSet.java to copy the changes made in ClientResultSet.java.",
