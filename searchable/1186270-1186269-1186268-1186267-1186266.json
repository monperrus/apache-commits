   "New tasks added for signing release artifacts.", 
   "Refactored the sub-project builds to use different configurations as defined in the local ivy.xml files. Only the 'publish-maven-release-artifacts' task found in ivy-java-common actually uses the pgp signing task, but now the configurations for publishlocal, publish-snapshot and publish-stagingarea are separated out from each other.  TODO - add this functionality to sign the build found in the release ant script. (At present there is just a batch file to do this)",
