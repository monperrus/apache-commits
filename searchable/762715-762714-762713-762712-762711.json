   "Added a (String,Throwable) constructor to WikiException and WikiSecurityException, and refactored the code so that it is used in preference to the (String) constructor where appropriate. This allows more verbose errors (and better troubleshooting) because the underlying cause of wrapped Exceptions can now be seen. Added some additional stack dumps to the WikiEngine initialization code so that odd fatal errors will be printed in server logs. This change has been forward-ported to the (3.0) trunk."

This means LoginModules used for JSPWiki integrated (custom) authentication can now access the WikiEngine and the HTTP request. Thanks to Lou Peters and many, many others for bringing this issue to my attention. Please test this function! This change has been forward-ported to the (3.0) trunk."
