   "Spark skins for Halo components. WARNING: The appearance of ALL applications is affected by this checkin. If you want to go back to the old skins, there is a new Halo theme (in frameworks/themes/Halo) that can be used to go back to the Flex 3 appearance.", 
   "This checkin introduces a new swc - sparkskins.swc. This swc contains the spark skins for the Halo components. (these skins depend on FXG, which means they cannot live in frameworks.swc).", 
   "This checkin also introduces a new theme - Halo. This is the Flex 3 theme, packaged for easy consumption.", 
   "Known issues:", 
   "* DMV and AIR components are not reskinned yet",

   "* PopUpButton/PopUpMenuButton does not differentiate over/down from popUpOver/popUpDown.", 
   "* Indeterminate progress bar is not final", 
   "* ComboBox/Menu drop shadows are incorrect (missing, actually...)", 
   "* Spark styles are mostly functional, but not entirely.", 
   "* Metadata for spark styles has not been added to the Halo components yet", 
   "* Focus drawing is off for many components", 
   "* Setting compatibilityVersion to 3.0.0 is not yet correctly loading the Halo skins (using 2.0.1 works)", 
   "There are some slight differences in appearance between some Halo and Gumbo components:", 
   "* Scroll thumb minimum size is smaller in Halo", 
   "* Height of text input is slightly different", 
   "* Slider data tips look different (this may be changing...)", 
   "* When using the halo theme and changing themeColor, you must also set rollOverColor and selectionColor", 
   "This checkin also fixes many bugs related to text styles in Gumbo components:",
