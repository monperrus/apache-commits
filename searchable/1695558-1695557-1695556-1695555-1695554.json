   "Updated OS.pm::create_text_file to ensure that text is added on a new line at the end of the file if called with the $append flag. This subroutine should correctly add newlines when necessary. Callers of append_text_file (which calls create_text_file) should not have to ensure a trailing newline exists in the string passed.",
