   "Fixed bug in image retrieval for xCAT.pm and vmware.pm. It wasn't accurately detecting if another image retrieval SCP process was running. It was getting hung up on SCP processes started by vmware.pm which send images to VMware hosts. The pgrep regex was fixed.", 
   "Added short delay before retrieving image for the number of seconds equal to the last digit of the reservation ID.  This prevents multiple reservations for the same image from starting SCP processes at the same time.", 
   "Removed unused $imagemeta_sysprep variable from vmware.pm::capture()."
