   "- http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-247 : Absolute path to strutsMerge file does not get inherited", 
   "- http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-9 : Pageflow annotation processors should extend TwoPhaseAnnotationProcessor", 
   "The latter issue is what most of this checkin is about.  Basically, I've integrated the NetUI Diagnostics class into the Controls TwoPhaseAnnotationProcessor, and changed the NetUI annotation processors to extend TPAP.  In the process, I separated the whole Generator (BaseGenerator) concept from the Checker (BaseChecker).  We no longer ask the Checker for a Generator -- now, the AnnotationProcessor can get both independently, and keeps track of the check-result in a map that's available to the Generator.",
