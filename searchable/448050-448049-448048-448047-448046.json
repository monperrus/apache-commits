   "Attaching the simplest patch possible for this issue--just changes SQLSTATE '42Z78' to a Derby-specific SQLSTATE, 'XML00'. I also moved SQLSTATE '42Z7Z' to 'XML01' since I believe it falls into the same category of \"Derby-specific errors that are not covered by the SQLStandard.\"", 
   "I read through the SQL standard definitions for SQLSTATES and none of them jumped out at me as being more appropriate than '42', so I just created a new set of SQLSTATEs, \"XMLxx\", for this particular issue. As I said, this was just the easiest way to go; if anyone can suggest a better SQLSTATE to fit the errors, please let me know. Otherwise, the d1772_v1.patch should be all it takes to resolve this issue.", 
   "Note: Since we don't currently have any tests for cases where the classpath is missing the required Xalan/JAXP classes, there were no test/master files to update. The need to add tests for such scenarios is filed as part of DERBY-1758."
