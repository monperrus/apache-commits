   "started the development of the long outstanding fundamental change of the tc:tree tag. (The change was announced in the tld-file long time ago.)", 
   "If you are using this tag and you want to update to version 1.0.9-SNAPSHOT of tobago you should change your code by renaming tc:tree to tc:treeOld.", 
   "The tc:treeOld tag will keep the old functionality for the time being.", 
   "The main change is TOBAGO-18: Implement a var attribute for the tree. The change will make the tree more flexible, the current version is very old, and has some disadvantages (e.g. the name of a node can't be set with an usual EL-Expression)."
