   "Revamp parsing code.", 
   "The DeserializationContext class is now the main \"outer\" SAX handler (what", 
   "SOAPSAXHandler used to be), and it uses a much cleaner recursive", 
   "descent style parse, delegating to SOAPHandlers which decide which", 
   "handlers should be pushed onto a stack.", 
   "The BodyBuilder/HeaderBuilder/EnvelopeBuilder handlers take care of", 
   "building up the actual MessageElements inside the SOAPEnvelope.", 
   "The HeaderBuilder is the place where we could consider adding custom", 
   "per-Header parse-time behaviour.", 
   "There is now an \"IDResolver\" interface, which will be used to handle things", 
   "like MIME attachments and URL references eventually - right now the only", 
   "concrete implementation is the LocalIDResolver.", 
   "I switched to James' SAX2EventRecorder class, since it provides a clean", 
   "interface to a \"master\" SAX recording for the whole message, which we've", 
   "talked about needing in various scenarios.  It should also perform pretty", 
   "well, as it builds many less objects than the \"object per event\" model.", 
   "*** JAMES : I had problems getting the SymbolTable to work, so I diked", 
   "out the complex string-management code and simply create a new", 
   "String per symbol - can you take a look at getting the original version to", 
   "work?  (pitfall warning - I had to change the indexes in the characters", 
   "event in the replay() method to account for the String, so the start index", 
   "is always zero at present)", 
   "MessageElements are now mostly divorced from the actual deserialization", 
   "process (i.e. they don't have a value member).", 
   "*** ALL : to handle deserializing HREF/IDs in an efficient way, we should", 
   "always let the Deserializers \"push\" values to us (via callbacks or FieldTargets", 
   "or what have you) rather than trying to \"pull\" the value from the Dser at", 
   "the end of an element.  We might even consider removing the", 
   "Deserializer.getValue() method entirely, to enforce this model.", 
   "I'm still not 100% happy with the modularization of the system, but it's better.", 
   "The code needs more comments and cleanup, but I'm checking it in now so", 
   "Sam can have something to test with.", 
   "Anyways, everything works on my machine, so let's see how it flies on yours!"
