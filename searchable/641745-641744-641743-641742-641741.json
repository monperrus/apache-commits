   "Added support for addressing all glyphs available in a Type 1 font, not just the ones in the font's primary encoding.", 
   "Typeface: getEncoding() changed to getEncodingName() to make clearer what is held here.", 
   "Some cleanup in the font classes to put the various things in more appropriate places.", 
   "Created a common base class for all Base 14 fonts (makes the hierarchy clearer).", 
   "Made PDFTextUtil more universally useful and made use of it in PDFRenderer, too.", 
   "Made PDFStream.add(String) more efficient. The encoding converter is not called for each invocation anymore as the whole thing get buffered by a BufferedWriter (as suggested by the javadoc of OutputStreamWriter)."
