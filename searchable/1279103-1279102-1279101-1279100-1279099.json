DataGroup uses the IList APIs through its dataProvider.  So the equivalent methods are now dataProvider.length, dataProvider, addItem, etc...  This is just the initial split work as there's more to come to get the files up to spec.  We will also have to visit how we deal with graphic elements in DataGroup vs. Group.
