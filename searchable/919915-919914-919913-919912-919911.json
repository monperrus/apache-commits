   "The idea behind this change is to make ELParser aware about isDeferredAsLiteral option.", 
   "Before this change ELParser was used to parse an attribute regardless of isELIgnored or isDeferredSyntaxAllowedAsLiteral values. With this change we do not use ELParser when isELIgnored is true and ELParser does not parse '#{' in expressions when isDeferredSyntaxAllowedAsLiteral is true.", 
   "It simplified the code in many places.", 
   "Also, servlet specification version from web.xml and JSP specification version from TLD file are now taken into account when determining the default values for isELIgnored and isDeferredSyntaxAllowedAsLiteral. As far as I understand the code, previously only isELIgnored was determined by the servlet specification version.", 
   "TstParser.java, bug48668a.jsp:", 
   "I reenabled the tests that now pass with these changes applied."
