   "Improved accuracy of font size selection. The font size is not rounded down to the next integer point value anymore. (Java2D renderers profit from that one, too)", 
   "PCL Renderer:", 
   "Found a use case for that Java2D ascent value (which I call MaxAscent). It is used for painting text as bitmaps and to make sure the image the text is painted on is big enough if the font ascends beyond the em box. For non-Java2D fonts, MaxAscent is the same as ascent.", 
   "Added a check that lets text painting fall back to bitmaps if there are characters that are not in the ISO-8859-1 encoding. This also enables Symbol and ZapfDingbats fonts.", 
   "A \"text-rendering\" setting allows to disable PCL text painting in case the mix of PCL and bitmap text painting should result in unwelcome output. Note: the bitmap rendering is relatively slow (many small bitmaps). In the end we might end up rendering using a BitmapRenderer and only wrapping the whole thing in PCL (much like the Windows PCL drivers do). This would be faster than creating many small bitmaps."
