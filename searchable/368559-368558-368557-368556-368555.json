   "fix the bug that was causing recreate.t to fail in 'make disttest'; sandbox-hstern.pm wasn't in the MANIFEST, so when 'make dist' made the distribution, it wasn't copied into the rules dir along with the rules that loaded it, hence causing parse errors, which triggered the recreate.t test to fail.   Also, add a test script for the mkrules compiler, with a variety of test cases"
