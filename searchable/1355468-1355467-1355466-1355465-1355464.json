   "Moved a few container definitions from the base/config/*-containers.xml files to their own component's ofbiz-component.xml file; this is a demonstration of the usage of the new ability to define component level containers; this is still experimental and there is room for improvements (and I am working on them and going to discuss a few details in the dev list) but this should already give a good idea of how we can remove redundancy from the various *-containers.xml files, remove dependencies between framework components and make the components self deployable."
