   "The VMTransport now let's it's peer know when it's being stopped so that the Peer can give its' transport listener a peer disconnected exception.  Otherwise a VM transport client could disconnect without the server side knowing it disconnected and the server side would not terminate it's side of the connection.  This could be seen as a memory leak on when the static network config is setup and one of the static brokers is not up."
