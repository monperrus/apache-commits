   "-) Shell component was needlessly buffering / delaying writing of important content like stylesheets / js inclusions / etc when there is no need to for the Relation / Style components.  Refactored to write this important content as early as possible as it does have a huge performance impact on the client side.. Even with a partial stream of output coming in to render a page most browsers will agressively download all js / style includes they see as soon as they see them.", 
   "-) The renderTime being captured by Shell was wrong. ..It was only measuring how long it took to render its own content instead of the entire response. Fixed that so people have realisitic numbers to look at."
