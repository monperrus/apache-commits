   "Optimization: cache horizontal scroll bar height and vertical scroll bar width after layout() to increase the accuracy of our guesses in layoutHelper().  In some cases, this will save us an iteration inside layoutHelper(), which in turn saves us a call to view.getPreferred...().  In cases where the view has expensive logic in its preferred size calculations, this savings can be measurable."
