   "Continuing work on classloading and codebase handling.  Now handling configuration files packaged inside the '.ssar' file.  Contained starter-service application (e.g. Reggie) now starts up successfully even though it's packed into a service archive.  Next step - complete the codebase server to map and serve download jar files (currently it starts up but doesn't serve files).  Also need to have the codebase server search for a free port."
