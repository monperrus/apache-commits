   "WikiSession receives several under-the-hood changes to improve session stability. The technique used to detect session status changes now includes an explicit check for prior authentication; this should prevent sudden \"downgrades\" from authenticated status to asserted (cookies). User/login Principals and the status strings (anonymous/asserted/authenticated) are cached now, rather than dynamically calculated. WikiSession gains a new public method, isAsserted() that does what it says. Finally, WikiSession now takes responsibility for populating the JAAS Subject with user profile principals, rather than the various login modules."
