   "Changed the way EntityCondition sub-classes work so they use the javolution Reusable class for recycling objects; now all conditions should be created using the factory methods on the EntityCondition object instead of the direct constructors; there is a small variety of classes available there now for ease of use; also changed a bunch of old code to not use the deprecated constructors; note that still need to do a pass similar to this on EntityExpr"
