   "OPENMEETINGS-460 first iteration of re-factoring of the in-memory HashMap that stores the sessions. Now done in several lists, so that no re-ordering or parsing of the list is needed to get a user by its: streamId, userId, publicSID or to get all users by a server or by a roomId. There is a JUnit test that covers the operations that have been tested and implemented so far. There might be more tests needed. Also there are some views on the list still to be done."
