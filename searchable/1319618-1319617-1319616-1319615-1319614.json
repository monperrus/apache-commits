   "1.  Changed Application.compile and Library.compile to call CompilerSwcContext.close() as one of the last things they do to make sure we clean up any open SWCs.", 
   "2.  Changed SwcLazyReadArchive to hold a pointer to a ZipFileHolder, instead of a ZipFile.  The archive creates a bunch of VirtualZipFiles, which all share a ZipFileHolder in order to share the underlying file handle.  However, if the swc archive has already been closed and the VirtualZipFile is accessed again, then it will create a new file handle that the archive doesn't know about, and so it won't be able to close it.  Now the archive points to the same ZipFileHolder that all it's VirtualZipFiles also point to, so it can be closed when the swc context is closed.",
