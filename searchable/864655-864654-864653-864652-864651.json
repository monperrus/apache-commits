   "Create a new branch for experimental Python bindings based on ctypes.", 
   "These new bindings consist of two parts:", 
   "1) low-level bindings, which are identical to the Subversion C API", 
   "but work from Python", 
   "2) high-level bindings, which are easy to use, well-documented and", 
   "Pythonic", 
   "Fortunately, ctypes ships with a code generator which does a very", 
   "good job of generating low-level bindings. We will need to do a", 
   "bit of work to integrate this code generator with our build system,", 
   "and to allow users to use pregenerated code if the ctypeslib code", 
   "generator is not installed. This work should be relatively easy.", 
   "The harder, and perhaps more important, task for the Python bindings", 
   "is to write some easy to use high level bindings. I've already written", 
   "some simple high-level bindings for the Client module, but we will need", 
   "to do quite a bit of work to finish them.", 
   "This commit was actually performed using the new ctypes bindings, as", 
   "a demonstration of how easy it is to use the new bindings.",
