   "Added DictionaryCreator2.java, which can favor anatomical site term text over equal text for signs/symptoms, disease/disorder, procedure.  Medical term text is separate, preserving drug names such as \"liver\" (live-er?)", 
   "Various static public methods added elsewhere to support DictionaryCreator2 functionality.", 
   "UmlsTermUtil is now less forgiving on things such as function texts ([liver disease]&/or[liver toxicity]), utilizing the new RemovalFunctionTriggers.txt data list.", 
   "UmlsTermUtil also no longer functionally handles template/form terms automatically e.g. \"heartbeat (___bpm)\", instead handling them according to the data/ list files."
