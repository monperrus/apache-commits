   "To support the auth refactoring, we introduce several *temporary* new servlet mock objects for unit testing: TestFilterChain, TestFilterConfig, TestHttpServletResponse, and TestServletContext. These are \"temporary\" because they will be replaced by Stripes mock objects later in the 2.7 release cycle."

Also, responsibilities for web authentication move to WikiServletFilter. Authentication is now configured via jspwiki.properties -- see that file for details. WikiSession API change: getLoginContext() vanishes."
