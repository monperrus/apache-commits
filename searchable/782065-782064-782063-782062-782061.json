   "OPENJPA-1113 - The 2nd level Reflection class cached object (Class -> (String -> Method)) is a Method object, which has a back reference back to the owning Class. The IBM JDK seems to be able to garbage-collect these caches using WeakReferenceHashMap. By forcing the value of the nested HashMap to be WeakReference, using the ConcurrentReferenceHashMap class, the Sun and IBM JDK 5/6 are able to release the cache content, if not needed. With these changes, the trunk maven build time has shortened by 5-10%."
