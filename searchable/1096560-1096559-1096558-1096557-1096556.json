   "Two changes in JAX-WS Endpoint implementation (1) Override setEndpointContext method, (2) Add logic to throw an exception if endpoint publishing is disabled by a property (publishing is enabled by default); per JSR-109 5.3.3 dynamically publishing endpoints in a server environment is non portable and should be disabled.  A server runtime can use the property to disabled dynamically publishing JAX-WS endpoints via Endpoint.publish methods."
