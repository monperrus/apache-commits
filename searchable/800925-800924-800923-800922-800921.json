   "LUCENE-1748: LUCENE-1001 introduced PayloadSpans, but this was a back compat break and caused custom SpanQuery implementations to fail at runtime in a variety of ways. This issue attempts to remedy things by causing a compile time break on custom SpanQuery implementations and removing the PayloadSpans class, with its functionality now moved to Spans."
