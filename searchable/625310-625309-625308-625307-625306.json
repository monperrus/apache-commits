   "Added a new JSP for verifying JSPWiki's security configuartion, admin/SecurityConfig.jsp. This JSP collaborates with a new class, c.e.j.auth.SecurityVerifier. SecurityConfig will verify the presence or absence of the JAAS login config file, the security policy file, and container-managed auth constraints. It will also validate that the correct JAAS login configations exist, and will print a summary table showing the privileges that apply to each role. Much needed, and should help folks get their security working."
