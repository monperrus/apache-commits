   "Fixed build errors for j2-admin PA.", 
   "A revision for 2.1.3 (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=592266) was not properly integrated into the trunk.", 
   "Some classes in j2-admin in the trunk are using new serialization API, but the API and implementation are not in the trunk.", 
   "So, just to build j2-admin PA properly, I overwrote the API with 2.1.3 interfaces and modified just a little in JetspeedSerializerImpl.java.", 
   "Anyway, j2-admin can now run wicket-based portlet.", 
   "For example, you can add a filter/filter mapping in web.xml and wicket portlet in portlet.xml for hello world example with two classes and a html template."
