   "Refactoring of the webtools application: all the remaining region pages have been migrated to screen widgets, with jsp artifacts transformed in bsh/ftl ones. Many thanks to Adrian Crum (et others, see OFBIZ-771 for details) for this work; I've also removed a few more files no more needed after the above changes. This is a Commit-Then-Review commit, I did quick tests and everything looks fine (there is place for improvements on layout, especially in the entity maintenance screens), but since all these changes are about the ui, I think it is not so bad to follow this approach and let the community to do more tests on it."
