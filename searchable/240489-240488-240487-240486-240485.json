   "Patch from \"Jarek Gawor\" <gawor@mcs.anl.gov>", 
   "Notes:", 
   "The attached patches contain an extended version of Axis WSDL2Java tool. It", 
   "works exactly the same as the basic WSDL2Java tool but it generates two more", 
   "classes: <Service>AddressingLocator.java and <Service>Addressing.java", 
   "interface. The <Service>AddressingLocator class can be used to get a Stub", 
   "for the service by passing a EndpointReferenceType. This will pass right", 
   "information to the Stub/Call so that appropriate WS-Addressing headers will", 
   "be set in the request (assuming the AddressingHandler is deployed)", 
   "The patches also contain minor fixes to AddressingHandler and a new test for", 
   "this tooling contribution."

   "1) Modified the code so that it exposes and uses standard JAX-RPC",

   "3) Added support for actors",

   "easier to control actors and mustUnderstand attributes and also so that", 
   "parsing/generating of the elements is done by the end classes.", 
   "5) Fixed some serialization/deserialization bugs with PortType,", 
   "ServiceNameType, RelatesTo (things that dealt with QName).", 
   "6) Also, added better tests."
