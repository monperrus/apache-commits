   "[UIMA-836] Fix doc on website to indicate top level dir for eclipse-home doesn't need to be called \"eclipse\".  Also clarify the need to run \"install\" before eclipse:eclipse, and why (needed for eclipse plugin projects).  Also, clean up formatting to allow browser window to be less wide (some <pre> lines were excessively long, others had breaks indicated with \"\\\" in the wrong places)."
