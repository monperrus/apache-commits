   "Applied the Notifications patch as described in WOOKIE-65. This filters notifications sent to widgets using Comet to ensure that only sibling instances (different user, same context, same widget URI) are notified of each other's changes to shared data/state. A hook is provided for other kinds of notifications (e.g. same user/context but different widget URI) to be implemented."
