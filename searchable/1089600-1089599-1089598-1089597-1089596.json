   "Attempt to get out of the SLF4J dependency hell and to make logging in the integration tests predictable. There is really no sense in having commons-logging, jcl-over-slf4j, log4j-over-slf4j, log4j and slf4j-jdk14 in the class path at the same time and then to configure commons-logging.properties to use SimpleLog. rampart-integration is now set up so that commons-logging and SLF4J both send logs to log4j."
