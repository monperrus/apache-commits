   "POD fix:  Truncated SYNOPSIS lines to 80 chars.  Mostly by removing the default values -- they are in the long description of the option and adding default values for *all* description would make the SYNOPSIS long and complex.  So everybody who wants to know the defaults should read the man page.  (I'm thinking about breaking the SYNOPSIS into several parts to make it less confusing.)"
