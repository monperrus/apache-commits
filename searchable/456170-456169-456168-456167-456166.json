   "throwing an exception for an unregconized boolean is problematic in webapps. E.g. checkboxes can send an empty string, which caused an exception. Returning false when the string is not regconized is consistent with the JDK and most webapp frameworks."

   "Added onBeginRender() and onEndRender() methods to Page as appropriate places to put code instead of overriding render() and calling super.render(), which is unadvisable.  Refactored WicketServlet, RequestCycle, Session, WebRequestCycle and WebSession all somewhat to support clustering.  These changes should affect nobody at the moment except that they may break clustering (I have no way to test it right now)."
