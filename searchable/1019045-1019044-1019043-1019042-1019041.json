   "FacetAbstract now requires that FacetHolder is not null.  To support this, enhanced the logic that reflectively instantiates ValueSemanticsProvider/EncoderDecoder/Parser/DefaultsProvider to look for a constructor that takes a FacetHolder prior to looking for a no-arg constructor.  This therefore supports implementations (such as BigDecimalValueSemanticsProviderFacet) that are also facets.  In addition... renamed ValueOid to AggregatedOid; made Oid extend from Encodeable; converted a couple of tests from JUnit3 to JUnit4; ExecutionContextFactory now accepts the RequestManager from its creating NakedObjectSystem with a view to us being able to inject into fixtures, to support a SessionFixture (this work not yet complete)."
