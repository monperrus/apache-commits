   "For some JVMs, Sun elects to throw a IOException when an InputStreamReader encounters a zero. For example, see http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4684515. This prevents JAMES IMAP from functioning correct when faced with some large emails. Most clients will simply call this method again if zero is returned so I think that this fix should reasonably safe but please review."
