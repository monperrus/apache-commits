   "TUSCANY-2809 Start adding Endpoint and EndpoitReference structures. Named with a 2 at the end so that I can develop in parallel with what is already there. I intend to carry on adding endpoint function but only actually enable if locally until we get to the point where it can replace function that people are already relying on to develop other parts of the code base. At them moment there is some builder support but no activators so the Endpoint structures don't do anything useful yet."
