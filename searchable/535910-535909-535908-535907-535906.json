   "DERBY-1054: NetServlet does not allow binding to non localhost interface", 
   "This change modifies the NetServlet.java class to allow for a \"host\"", 
   "parameter to be passed in via the web.xml file. That way we can control", 
   "the listening interface. The sample web.xml is enhanced with additional", 
   "information about how to set the host parameter.", 
   "Note that there are security implications to setting a non-localhost", 
   "value for the host. Such a server should be properly configured so that", 
   "access to it is authenticated and secured. A separate docs patch enhances", 
   "the NetServlet documentation to note these considerations."
