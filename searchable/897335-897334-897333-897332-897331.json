   "Applied patch for WOOKIE-87 which improves the widget template (Thanks to Ross Gardler for the patch). While checking this over I noticed a few widgets using the deprecated uid attribute rather than id so I've updated these. Wookie's parser is quite lax and does check for uid if no id attribute is found, but its better to use the correct attribute for spec conformance and interoperability with other W3C implementations."
