   "DERBY-766 DERBY-1714 Working method in CodeChunk that splits expressions out of generated methods that are too large. Bumps the number of unions supported in largeCodeGen to over 6,000 from around 800. Also increases the number of rows supported in a VALUES clause. A large number of UNION clauses still requires a large amount of", 
   "memory for optimization (see DERBY-1315). A large number of rows in a VALUES clause fails at some point due to a StackOverflow.", 
   "In 10.1 this completes the merge of changes for DERBY-176/DERBY-766 but I am seeing out of memory exceptions on more at 1800 unions, even when bumping memory to 512M.  I will investigate some more to see if there is another change that needs to go to 10.1 to enable the large number of unions."
