   "Another fairly large change in the DTM architexture (sic)....", 
   "We've changed DTM's internal behavior so it can now assign", 
   "more than one \"DTM ID\" to a single document, cascading from", 
   "one ID to the next. This means that the size of a single DTM is", 
   "no longer limited by the bits available in the low part of the DTM", 
   "Node Handle. This means we can support larger documents.", 
   "That has allowed us to reduce the number of bits reserved", 
   "for that portion of the node addresing scheme... which in turn has", 
   "increased the number of bits available for use in the DTM ID. This", 
   "means we can now have many more documents active at once.", 
   "The trade-off is that huge documents will require more than one", 
   "DTM ID and thus cut into the number of documents, But since we", 
   "now have 16 bits of DTM ID space, I don't think we're really likely", 
   "to run into both limits at once. And the changes are essentially", 
   "limited to the DTM layer; the rest of Xalan should be unaffected.", 
   "In the process of making this change, I've also encapsulated the", 
   "conversions between DTM API node handles and DTMDefaultBase's", 
   "internal node indices. That should be safer all 'round.", 
   "NOTE: One side effect of this change is that the strings", 
   "generated by the key() function have changed again.", 
   "I've updated the IDKEY testcases to reflect this.", 
   "Smoketest is currently passing everything except", 
   "axes109 and the API's TraceListenerTest . But I believe", 
   "those failures are due to a glitch in my test directory", 
   "since they also happen when I run the D13 code there,", 
   "whereas D13 runs fine in the directory where I built it.", 
   "I'm going to assume that \"same result is no new bug\"", 
   "for now."
