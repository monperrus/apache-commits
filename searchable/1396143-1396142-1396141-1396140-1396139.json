   "For some reason, the \"active by default\" equinox38 profile is not executing on the build machine, which means the META-INF/maven/paxexam-config.args file is never generated and causes initialization failures when the test classes annotated with @RunWith(MavenConfiguredJUnit4TestRunner.class) are executed. Everything works fine locally. This commit updates the profiles to specify the same maven-paxexam-plugin version that works locally just in case this is a version mismatch issue."
