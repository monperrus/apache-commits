   "[HBASE-10236] Avoid creating extra connection when locating a region", 
   "Author: gauravm", 
   "Summary:", 
   "In Swift, I found that inside locateRegionInMeta(), we create a connection to meta, before checking if the region's location is in the cache. Most of the time, we expect a hit, hence most of the time, we end up creating a useless connection object. In swift, a lot of these objects caused the thread pool to get exhausted while starting up.", 
   "This might not be a problem in trunk, but still it seems like an improvement.",
