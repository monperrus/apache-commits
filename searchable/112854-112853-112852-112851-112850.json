   "An early implementation of a jellydoc plugin.",

   "Its still fairly simple and basic right now. Its using a doclet (rather than xdoclet or qdox) and doesn't handle DynaTag implementations very well - so I'm sure we can improve this over time. However for now this might help other projects (like Maven itself as well as other projects like Latka, Drools, Werkflow etc) create auto-generated documentation for their tags."
