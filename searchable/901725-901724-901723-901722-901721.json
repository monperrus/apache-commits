   "Changed the default behaviour of the Zookeeper Discovery client back to what it was in CXF-DOSGi 1.1.", 
   "The zookeeper discovery client is dormant until configured. It can be configured through the OSGi Configuration Admin service.", 
   "To enable it, at least the following value needs to be provided for its PID: org.apache.cxf.dosgi.discovery.zookeeper", 
   "zookeeper.host=...", 
   "Also fixed the updated() method on the Activator (ManagedService) to update the service registration properties of the ManagedService once a configuration update is made.", 
   "Additionally, changed the zookeeper-server-config/src/main/java/org/apache/cxf/dosgi/discovery/zookeeper/server/config/Activator.java which is used in the CT to set the zookeeper.host to 127.0.0.1 for the test runs."
