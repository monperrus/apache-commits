   "Yet more improvements for JSSE 1.1.x", 
   "The timeout is still problematic.  The settings here work-for-me, but I'm open to tweaking.  The old settings were too strict, since they didn't give enough time for non-MSIE browsers to finish the client interaction.  The new settings are still a little slow however.", 
   "The main fix is that since JSSE 1.1.x already computes X509Certificates, we don't have to waste cycles computing them again."
