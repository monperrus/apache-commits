   "DERBY-3373: SQL distinct and order by needed together.", 
   "Derby was issuing the error message \"The ORDER BY clause may not specify", 
   "an expression, since the query specifies DISTINCT\" in situations where", 
   "the message was not appropriate. An example of a query that should have",

   "statement cannot distinguish between valid expressions and invalid ones,",
