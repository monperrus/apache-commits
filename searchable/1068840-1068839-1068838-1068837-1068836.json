   "In revision 1064727 the integration-test module was enabled for stanbol enhancer (see STANBOL-19 for details). However the dependency of the integration-test module to the launchers/full module caused the build order to be changed. Specifically the launchers/full module was build before the clerezza/clerezza-sparql module.", 
   "Because of that the build process was broken if the bundle created by the clerezza/clerezza-sparql module was not already present in the local maven represitory (e.g. from a previous build).", 
   "This change moves the integration-module after the launchers (and the clerezza/clerezza-sparql module) and therefore restores the intended build order."
