   "- correct error with md5 checksums all being the same (each needs unique property name, as the checksum task doesn't reset the property if it already has a value).", 
   "- change ant build to automatically download jars.", 
   "- change javadocs directory from \"api\" to \"apidocs\" so that its the same as the maven build.", 
   "- change ant/maven builds to skip jsdoc and dojo tasks if their jars can't be found.", 
   "- change release notes to be html and link to local (rather than online) changes-report.html.", 
   "- remove jdepend plugin report (removes one repeat of the tests by maven).", 
   "- make dojo task part of jar goal, rather than compile (maven repeats compile goal 3 times!)."
