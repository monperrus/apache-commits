   "QPID-3911: Fix deadlock on concurrent invocation of MessageConsumer#close() and Session#rollback() from consumer MessageListener", 
   "This patch contains the following changes:", 
   "- Add synchronization on AMSession#_messageDeliveryLock into MessageConsumer#close() in order to block until message listener in progress has completed(as required in JMS javadoc for MessageConsumer#close()).", 
   "- Change the session dispatcher to stop messages delivery into consumer local message queue if the consumer in the process of closing. This eliminates the need to stop the dispatcher on rejecting pending messages for closing consumer.", 
   "- Remove the synchronization on the dispatcher lock from AMQSession.Dispatcher#rejectPending and code to stop the dispatcher, as we are synchronizing on the deliveryLock now and incoming messages are not dispatched into closing consumers anymore.", 
   "- Add a system test to reproduce the deadlock and verify its resolution.", 
   "Applied patch from Oleksandr Rudyy <orudyy@gmail.com>", 
   "merged from trunk r1310275"
