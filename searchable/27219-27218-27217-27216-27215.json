   "- fixed some bugs like missing repository.xml and EmployeeImpl.class;", 
   "- renamed EmployeeImpl to EmployeeDAO (data access object) as it is not an implementation of an interface as one would expect;", 
   "- classes to be enhanced into additional package \"bean\"", 
   "- moved java files from conf and conf/java to src/java/**/samples/ (what hacks have that been!!), so the default samples build can be used;", 
   "- made \"personnel\" datasource the default in repository.xml as \"default\" is not available in cocoon.xconf and so does not work;", 
   "Please never so much hacks in a build again! It was a hard work to get that working!"
