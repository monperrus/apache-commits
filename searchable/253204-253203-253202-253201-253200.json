   "1) The Java2WSDL and WSDL2Java emitters contained many references to literal strings representing",

   "namespace uris will automatically be reflected in the emitters.", 
   "2) Added additional namespace and namespace prefix constants to org.apache.axis.Constants.", 
   "(i.e. WSDL & WSDD constants)", 
   "3) Added static methods (like isSchemaXSD(string)) to Constants to query whether a string matches",
