   "Resolves issue OODT-319. \"--skipIngest\" is now available as a command line option. This will cause the crawler to skip the ingestion step and ignore any post ingest actions. While looking at the code involved with ingest it was observed that if a preingest action fails then postingest fail actions will be called. This was left this way to preserve behavior of existing systems but the question should be addressed as to whether or not failing preingest actions means that ingest failed."
