   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3253 - Support Temporary Destinations in a network without advisories. Allow the connection id generator prefix to be set via a connection factory such that temp identies can be configured such that they are suitable for inclusion in a network list of statically included destintions. Allow auto recreation of temp destinations by a new producer and tie lifecycle to the producers connection. This allows configurable support for request reply with temps in a network with advisory support disabled"
