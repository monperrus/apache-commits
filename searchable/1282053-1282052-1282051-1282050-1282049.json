   "The partAdded() and partRemoved() methods of Spark components now dispatch new events named \"partAdded\" and \"partRemoved\", of type SkinPartEvent. The accessibility implementation classes will soon use these events to know when skin parts are added and removed so that they can attach and remove event handlers appropriately. This mechanism may change in a future release, so developers should not depend on these undocumented events.",
