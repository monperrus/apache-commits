   "Major improvements to the BundleInstaller (Sling Installer Provider plugin for installing resources provided by OSGI bundles)", 
   "* fixes STANBOL-530: Resources are now correctly uninstalled even if the Bundle is already in the UNINSTALLED state and Resources within the Bundle are no longer accessible", 
   "* fixes STANBOL-531: the ID of resources is now correctly parsed even if the configured  Install-Path is also contained within the name of the resource", 
   "* implements STANBOL-532: Resources are once again uninstalled if Bundles are STOPPED. However the BundleInstaller now checks if those events are caused by a User or the OSGI environment shutting down."
