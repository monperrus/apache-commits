   "This commit has 2 simple fixes (DERBY-2951 which gives assert failure and DERBY-2959 The table will have collation type UCS_BASIC which is different than the collation of the schema TERRITORY_BASED hence this operation is not supported.)", 
   "The failure in DERBY-2951 is because in store, we were not using correct format id and hence collation information was not getting written out and read from disk. Added a test case for this in CollationTest.", 
   "The failure in DERBY-2959 was because of the bug that we were comparing collation type for non-character types. Collation is only applicable to character types and hence we should check for character types before comparing the collation info. Added a test case for this one too."
