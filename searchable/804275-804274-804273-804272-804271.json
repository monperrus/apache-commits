   "DERBY-4330 NullPointerException or assert failure when re-executing PreparedStatement after lock timeout",

   "happens (or a deadlock), the result set tree for prepared statements", 
   "for some queries is partically in a closed, partially in an open", 
   "state. (The issue was reported for a join query, but exists for others",

   "being reused, i.e. when the prpared statement is attempted re-executed", 
   "after the timeout, since the tree is expected to be fully closed at", 
   "that time, cuasing the assert or NPE.", 
   "The fix ensures that the tree is left in a fully closed state in such",
