   "After the recent changes in the servlet service fw and changed the logging bundle the OSGi samples work.", 
   "* Changed from the ordinary Commons Logging and Log4J bundles to OPS4J Pax Logging, as the classloader handling in Commons Logging is really hard to get working with OSGi. Pax Logging supports all popular logging frameworks and works well with OSGi.", 
   "* The Eclipse Equinox bundles are downloaded from the OPS4J Maven repository, so no manual downloads are needed anymore.", 
   "* The Cocoon bundles are started at a higher start level than the Spring OSGi extender, which ensures that the Spring bean services are started automatically."
