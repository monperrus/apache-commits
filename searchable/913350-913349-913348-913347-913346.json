   "Made changes to Ingester and to ProductCrawler's usage of Ingesters", 
   "- ProductCrawler now can accept any Ingester which controls how communication with a back end database is controlled.  Currently there are now two Ingesters: StdIngester and CacheIngester.  CacheIngester still communicates with the file manager in the same way as StdIngester however it keeps a local cache of ingested files so that queries to the file manager are limited.",
