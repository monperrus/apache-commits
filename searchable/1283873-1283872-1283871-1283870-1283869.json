   "First checkin for the \"Arbitrary Type Interpolation\" feature. This feature has a rewritten Tween class (now named flex.effects.Animation). This class supports the old Tween capabilities, but adds functionality such as the ability to supply alternate interpolation objects (to allow animation of non-Number types), a new Easing API, and new 'repeat behavior' that will allow terser looping or reversing animations. The existing new effects were slightly changed to use the new Animation class (instead of Tween), and the superclass of the new effects, AnimateProperties (renamed 'Animate'), is now a subclass of Effect (not TweenEffect).", 
   "Added various new interpolation and easing classes, along with the new packages flex.effects.interpolation and flex.effects.easing. Also added new color-interpolation effect, 'Tint'.", 
   "Expect slight tweaks to the API during i7, but the bulk of the functionality and API changes are being checked in now.",
