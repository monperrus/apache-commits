   "make handling of OJB in managed environments more flexible, introduce methods is/setManaged in PBImpl. Now the ConnectionManager can decide (using the new 'managed' flag) when it's allowed to change the autoCommit state and to commit/rollback a connection (in managed environment it's not allowed to do this). A specific ConnectionFactory implementation (ConnectionFactoryManagedImpl) is no longer needed"
