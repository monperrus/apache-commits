   "Implemented support for License element in Widget as a separate bean class; also included bidirectional text support, and implemented associated conformance tests. License is now also displayed in widget metadata (e.g. GET /wookie/widgets/) to enable conformance testing. However we may wish to limit this in future releases to reduce potential vulnerabilities (e.g. malicious code embedded in license text) - I'll create a new issue for this one."
