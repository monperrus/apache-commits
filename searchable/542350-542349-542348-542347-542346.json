   "Significant upgrade the VS Addin: 1) Exception handling and logging; 2) Shutdown of maven embedder on IDE exit; 3) you no longer need to shut down the IDE when switching solutions. Downside of cleanup: required leakage of MS api into core IDE classes (breaking #develop). Also cleaned up build."

   "some cleanup work on trackback processing to fix ROL-1350.", 
   "This commit creates a general utility class for representing trackbacks, triggering a trackback request over http, and retrieving good response messaging.  We move the trackback sending logic out of the WeblogManager interface because there is really no reason why trackbacks need to be part of the WeblogManager because it doesn't require any persistence.  The new trackback implementation makes use of the commons httpclient to help with the trackback sending."
