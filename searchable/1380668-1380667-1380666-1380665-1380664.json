   "ARIES-910: Attempts to fix the one remaining subsystems test failure on the build machine (e.g.see https://builds.apache.org/job/Aries/org.apache.aries.subsystem$org.apache.aries.subsystem.itests/1658/testReport/org.apache.aries.subsystem.itests/RootSubsystemTest/testServiceEvents__equinox_3_8_0_V20120529_1548_/). The issue does not occur in a local build and seems to be happening when the version of the requested artifact to install is computed. This fix bypasses the computation and specifies the version explicitly."
