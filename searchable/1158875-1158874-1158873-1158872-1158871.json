   "GERONIMO-6055 This change limits the ClassLoader searching (getWiredBundle, etc) that will occur during BeanValidation application startup. ValidatorFactory creation time becomes nearly zero. Bean Validation TCK tests passed for me. Would like some validation of this. Will also need to keep an eye out for any potential side effects. There may be better ways of doing this. So, alternatives welcome."
