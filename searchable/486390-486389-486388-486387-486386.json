   "Added some doc from RFC 4517 & RFC 4512. Added m-extensionSyntax and m-extensionMatchingRule AT. Fixed some types. Removed the MUST (m-oid) when the OC inherit from metaTop, where the m-oid is already declared in MUST. Removed the m-description from MUST and moved it to MAY in metaTop. Fixed Syntax OC which was totally buggy"
