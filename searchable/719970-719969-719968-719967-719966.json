   "Made the code formatting style consistent with the java implementation, this patch basically does a --php-shindig ++php-shindig, but other then formatting there are no changes to the code (else this patch would be impossible to audit). It was something that was already considered and talked about for a long time, but with a release just around the corner, it was now or never.. To make the transission to the new formatting slightly less painful I've included both a style guide document and a Zend Studio formatting xml file export which detail the new code formatting style. My apologies for the commit spam, confusion and bandwidth consumption this will undoubtedly cause"
