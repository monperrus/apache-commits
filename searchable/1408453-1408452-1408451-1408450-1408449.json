   "Reworked Linux code which configures the sshd and ext_sshd services including the modification of rc.local. Changed flow so sshd configuration is reverted to normal before an image is captured. When the image is loaded, sshd listens on all interfaces. Once sshd responds, the vcld code configures ext_sshd and implements security measures such as locking down sshd so that it only responds to the management node.", 
   "Separated out calls to the different init daemon into separate init modules. The ones currently implmented are SysV, systemd, and Upstart. Updated Ubuntu.pm to use the Upstart.pm module."
