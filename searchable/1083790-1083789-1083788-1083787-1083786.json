   "Added a client API for the Whitelist admin functions. See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WOOKIE/Wookie+Admin+REST+API for information on how to use this with an admin client. Combined with the WARP API this starts to decouple the administration interface of Wookie from the built-in JSP/servlets so we can use Widgets to manage a Wookie server instance using any kind of container."
