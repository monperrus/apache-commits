   "OPENJPA-182. Moved to API-based model. Query.setHint() can still be used via the query hint => fetch plan binding.", 
   "Removed the logic to override the forUpdate value, since the calling code already incorporates fetch configuration data into its decision about how to invoke toSelect(). Added a test case to assert this behavior.", 
   "Also cleaned up some minor whitespace issues, and reduced code duplication by moving a couple of concepts up into DBDictionary. Removed some seemingly-unnecessary overrides from H2Dictionary.", 
   "Added a test case for isolation level configuration. For non-DB2 dictionaries, it asserts that an exception is thrown during execution. Someone with DB2 knowledge / access should fill in the test case for the DB2 cases. As we add support for per-query isolation level configuration for other databases, we should change this test case."
