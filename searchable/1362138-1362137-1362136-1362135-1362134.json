   "[jira] [HBASE-6387] [89-fb] Cache DNS lookups in HServerAddress", 
   "Summary:", 
   "We have noticed that we rely on DNS lookups in some critical paths by using HServerAddress, and Java only seems to be caching DNS data for 30 seconds by default. Also, if DNS is down, Java's negative cache of DNS will ensure that many successive attempts fail. However, we cannot just increase networkaddress.cache.ttl to a large value, because e.g. namenode failover may require resolving the same DNS name differently. Therefore I propose that we add a DNS lookup cache in HServerAddress.",
