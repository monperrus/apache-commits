   "Recompile JSPs if last modified time of the source or any of its dependencies changes either forwards or backwards. Note that this introduces an incompatible change to the code generated for JSPs. Tomcat will automatically re-compile any JSPs and tag files found in the work directory when upgrading from 7.0.16 or earlier to 7.0.17 or later. If you later downgrade from 7.0.17 or later to 7.0.16 or earlier, you must empty the work directory as part of the downgrade process."
