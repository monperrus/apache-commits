   "QPID-2104: LVQ enhancement", 
   "These both required some refactoring of the Queue class to allow cleaner implementation of different types of behaviour. The in-memory storage of messages is now abstracted out behind an interface specified by qpid::broker::Messages which qpid::broker::Queue uses. Different implementations of that are available for the standard FIFO queue, priority queues and LVQ (I have also separated out the 'legacy' implementation of LVQ from the new version driven by QPID-2104)."
