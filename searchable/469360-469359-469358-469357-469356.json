   "Fix bug 37458 where concurrent attempts to load the same class could set entry.manifest to null in one thread whilst the other thread(s) were operating under the assumption it was still non-null.", 
   "I had to add a largish sync block to do this (since the package sealing check also uses entry) but it is on <code>entry</code> rather than <code>this</code> so the impact should be minimal.", 
   "I also fixed a rare but possible IAE in the package definition section. Looking at the dev archive, at least one user has seen this problem so it isn't entirely theoretical."
