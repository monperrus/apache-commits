   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",

For layouts that don't try and set the post transform bounds (i.e., absolute layout without constraints), the layout scale and rotation will be centered on this point.  The offset transform will also be centered around this point.", 
   "- layering is now decoupled from item order.  By default, components now render in order based on the value of their 'layer' property.  All components' layers default to 0.  components with the same layer render in the order they appear in their parent group's item list.", 
   "- setting transform.matrix on UIComponent is now supported, and is roughly the same as setting the convenience layout properties on the component.",
