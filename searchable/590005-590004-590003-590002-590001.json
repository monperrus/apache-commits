   "A few changes to the way auto marketing packages are handled:", 
   "1.  No longer producing for the current order only, all orders are taken into account, so we're now trying to produce whatever will get the ATP back to zero.", 
   "2.  Only producing what the available components will allow, ie. if we need to produce 10 units but only have enough components for 5 then that's all we'll produce.", 
   "3.  Because of (1) no longer associating the production run to the order item via WorkOrderItemFulfillment.", 
   "4.  Moved the call to createProductionRunForMktgPackage so that it is called when an order is edited as well (Fixes OFBIZ-714, the marketing package was decomposed when cancelling inventory reservations but not reproduced afterwards)."
