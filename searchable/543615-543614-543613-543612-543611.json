   "removing templateAdd action and moving its method into the templates action.  this is basically needed because we can't do proper validation in templateAdd because the way it works is to always dispatch to the templates action for display.  however, struts2 validation works by simply detecting action errors, even if they were set on a different action, and thus the action chain gets messed up when the templateAdd action would report any errors.  this approach is the easiest solution."
