   "- Added new <code>maven.ejb.build.dir</code> property that specifies the location where the EJBs are generated.", 
   "- Modified existing <code>maven.ejb.final.name</code> property (and exposed it as a public property) so that it doesn't include the path (the path is now provided by the new <code>maven.ejb.build.dir</code> property). This allows aligning the WAR and EJB plugin properties. Note: This is a breaking change for all those using the <code>maven.ejb.final.name</code> property (which was not a public property).", 
   "- Made the <code>maven.ejb.final.name</code> property public as it is required by several other plugins and before this change the only way is for these plugins was to call the non-public <code>ejb:init</code> goal."
