   "This commit speed up tests and should avoid lookup on on-line resources (STANBOL-177, STANBOL-178). Problem was related both to a not efficient implementation of the test initialization. Also testing the handling of non existent and anonymous ontologies resulted in an on-line lookup. Those kind of resources have been commented in the onology registry used by RegistryTest (krestest.owl)."
