   "- Fixed a case similar to http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-960, where loading a JAR resource through an URL could cause Tomcat 5.5.x redeploy issues because of file-locking on Windows.  For the original bug, I entered http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37034 on Commons Digester (and provided a patch), which would provide a workaround for the issue (a JDK bug, really).",
