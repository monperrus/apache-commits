   "WSCOMMONS-58: added test harness to 'round trip test' *all* the valid schemas from the W3C xsts-2002-01-16.tar.gz test bucket. The list of schemas to test is taken from the three .testSet files in the xmlschema2002-01-16 directory of the extracted xsts-2002-01-16.tar.gz.", 
   "There is one .testSet file for each of NIST, Microsoft and Sun test schemas. A single junit test is created for each schema tested - so the report is now much more detailed.", 
   "I've removed NISTSchemaTest.java - tests.w3c.TestW3CSchemaTestSet will by default run the same set (except it creates and runs a separate junit test case for each schema in the NIST set.",

   "'ant test' runs the NIST bucket but now uses tests.w3c.TestW3CSchemaTestSet to do that instead of NISTSchemaTest",
