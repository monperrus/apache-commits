   "o Created non-abstract base class for DefaultArtifactFactory to extend, called ArtifactConstructionSupport, which provides centralized means for constructing artifacts consistently without all the maven-core specific methods. These maven-core specifics not delegate to the generic methods provided in this new class.", 
   "o Adjusted the maven-archetype stuff to work with the new artifact creation/resolution/etc. methods in maven-artifact and maven-core.", 
   "o Removed all direct construction of DefaultArtifact and replaced with ArtifactConstructionSupport where it would have involved putting the DefaultArtifactFactory in the plexus.xml, and where the code doesn't need dependency-oriented methods.", 
   "o Archetype works now, using the example provided in plexus/plexus-site/src/site/apt/building-plexus-applications.apt"
