   "- Changed how a shared displayObject is positioned in a GraphicElement. Previously, it was always placed at (x,y). Now, it is placed at (0,0) if the displayObject can be shared (ie. it has no transforms). This solves the problem of a sharedDisplayObject getting repositioned without the GraphicElement being aware of it.", 
   "- Optimized Group.updateDisplayList so that we only redraw the GraphicElement's that share a displayObject that needs to be updated. Added a new class called InvalidatingSprite which has a single property called \"invalid\". If a GraphicElement needs to be redrawn, it marks its shared or unshared displayObject as invalid. Group will then only update the GraphicElements whose displayObject is marked invalid. Added invalidateDisplayList calls in a few missing places.", 
   "QE Notes: Some of the mustella bitmaps need to be regenerated. The player renders differently two transformed sprites that draw the same visuals. For example, a rotated sprite at (0,0) with a drawRect at (20,20) will look from a rotated sprite at (20,20) with a drawRect at (0,0).",
