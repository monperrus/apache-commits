   "[master] Let OldLogsCleaner find out whether logs are archived to hourly directory", 
   "Author: fan", 
   "Summary: There was a static boolean initialized by HLog constructor to indicate whether logs should be archived to hourly directory. But OldLogsCleaner only runs on HMaster, which does not have HLog instance. It could not get the correct configuration so cleanup was still using the legacy way.", 
   "Test Plan:",

   "2. Replaced jar on master of os 8. The cleaner has expected behavior now.",
