   "Added a warning that appears when you override validate() on a class that extends the (deprecated) FormData.  If you do this, declarative validation annotations won't work unless you call super.validate().",

   "- The file that contains expected warnings/errors had everything concatenated to a single line, with no delimiter between each line.  This made it really difficult to figure out what went wrong when there was a diff.  In addition, the expected/actual output files were compared by chopping up the single-line output into pieces using ',' as the delimiter (not sure why), then sorting it.  I changed all this so that the files contain multiple lines, just like the real compiler output.", 
   "- Fixed to clear the warningsorerrors.actual file before each run of apt.  Without this, you had to run 'test.clean test.build' before 'compiler.bvt' each time.",
