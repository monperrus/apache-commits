   "MAHOUT-479: This commit refactors Cluster to inherit from Model<VectorWritable> instead of AbstractCluster", 
   "which now inherits just Cluster. The existing Dirichlet models also now inherit from Cluster, simplifying the use", 
   "of generics and cleaning up a lot of the code.", 
   "Since Dirichlet now can iterate over arbitrary Clusters as its models, this opens up the entire set of DistanceMeasure", 
   "based clusters for Dirichlet processing. This should allow the output of e.g. Canopy to become the prior model", 
   "distribution in a subsequent Dirichlet step. Is this a feature?", 
   "The AbstractCluster hierarchy has been adjusted allowing GaussianClusterDistribution and", 
   "DistanceMeasureClusterDistribution to instantiate its subclasses. Both have tests and seem to work as expected.", 
   "All unit tests run. More to follow"
