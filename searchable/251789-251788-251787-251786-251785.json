   "object is an InputStream pointing at some XML which should be in the", 
   "body of the SOAP envelope.  New subtype of SOAPBodyElement called", 
   "InputStreamBody which encapsulates this input stream.  When asked to", 
   "output() to the SerializationContext, it just writes the stream.", 
   "(NOTE: there are potential problems embedding XML inside XML like this,", 
   "but we'll leave them for theorizing about later)", 
   "There is also a new body type called \"DOMBody\" which encapsulates a", 
   "DOM Element, and walks the element to output XML during serialization.", 
   "This is to allow programmatic construction of bodies (such as we do in", 
   "MsgDispatchHandler).", 
   "To be able to distinguish which kind of body to create, I threaded the", 
   "ServiceDescription down through the Message object and the", 
   "SOAPSAXHandler so that clients can set it before the SOAP envelope", 
   "gets parsed.  Then at parse time, if the service is registered as RPC,", 
   "we make an RPCBody, otherwise a plain old SOAPBodyElement.  This", 
   "needs some more thinking, both in terms of cleaning up the design and", 
   "also potentially dealing with a situation where you don't know if it's an", 
   "RPC until after you parse (i.e. when doing dispatch based on the body", 
   "element's namespace).", 
   "Also did some general cleanup, removed a few debugging printlns, etc."
