   "Provide a mechanism for dealing with commonly used (X)HTML entity references.  entities can be registered", 
   "using ParserOptions.  All the default HTML entities are preregistered.", 
   "The one downside to this mechanism is that it changes the xml infoset of the parsed objects so that digital signatures computed over documents that contain the unresolved entities are unverifiable.  To deal with this, there is a mechanism for turning off the replacement so that the current behavior of throwing an error is preserved."
