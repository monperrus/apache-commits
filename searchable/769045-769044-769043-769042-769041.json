   "[vysper] VYSPER-17 (was: LABS-354): storage service reg, sustantial changes. Changing storage between in-memory and JCR is changing only one line of code now. all storages share a common interface and registry in the runtime context. two one-method interfaces AccountCreation and AccountVerification have been merged to make this more elegantly possible. UserAuthorization need no longer be exposed through the server runtime context. Adding users is now possible for in-memory user authorization, too. A bug when installing a single module has been fixed (initialize() not called)."
