   "Refactor CouchDbObject into DefaultNoSqlObject.", 
   "- Back when I was looking into the APIs for some other NoSQL drivers, I noticed that almost all of them use Map<String, Object> as their document type. Only MongoDB uses a more specific class. Therefore, I've renamed the CouchDbObject class due to its versatility in supporting more NoSQL drivers in the future.",
