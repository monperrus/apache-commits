   "Updated Windows.pm::set_password to better handle the updating of scheduled task passwords. It now specifies the username when issuing the schtasks.exe command in case the username stored in the task contains an old computer name.  The code was changed to not return false if it fails to set a scheduled task password because of Windows 7 bug which causes \"ERROR: The parameter is incorrect\" to be returned if schtasks.exe is used to change the password of a task created using the GUI.  There was also a problem caused by utils.pm::run_ssh_command().  The output it returned included carriage returns at the end of the lines of Windows command output.  It was updated to remove these.", 
   "VCL-164", 
   "There were 2 get_user_info subroutines in utils.pm.  These were consolidated and the calls to get_user_info() in image.pm. and blockrequest.pm were updated accordingly."
