   "QPID-1817 : Update to QpidTestCase to use setUp to start the broker this allows tests to update the _configFile that is being used before the broker is started. By default the etc/config-systests.xml is used. This differs from the stock config.xml only in that it disables the Managment JMX interface by default. If a test requires this functionality it can provided an edited configuration. An example of how that might be done can be seen in SyncWaitDelayTest and will additionally be provided for QPID-1813.", 
   "A couple of tests were modified to remove their setUp/tearDown where the code did no additional work. This made the tests cleaner. Additionally FrameworkBaseCase never actually called super.setUp() so that was fixed."
