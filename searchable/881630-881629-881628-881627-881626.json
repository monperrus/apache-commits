   "Fixes accommodating more Neko 1.9.13 behavior.", 
   "1. Reintroduces document normalization behavior, in particular ensuring that <body> exists in the returned document.", 
   "2. Pushes all <script> elements in parsed HTML <head> element to the start of <body>, in order. This ensures that gadget scripts referencing document.body work appropriately. This may have odd side-effects if a particular gadget server installation oscillates between String- and DOM-based rewriters, since each String-to-DOM conversion (in MutableContent) will see <head><script> moved to <body>. Still, this change should be functionally intact.", 
   "I'm working on a GadgetHtmlParser subclass using Caja's non-validating/rejiggering parser now, which better fits with Shindig's use case. This code will hopefully tide us over until that time."
