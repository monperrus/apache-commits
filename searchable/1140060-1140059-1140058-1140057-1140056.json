   "huge Graph refactory, a big step back to the initial graph version. current APIs model the Graph in the wrong way, above all because they suggest users to insert, for Undirected graphs, the same Edge info, twice, and that's absolutely wrong, according to math definitions.", 
   "Especially, the following tense in that article[1] suggests that the current model is wrong:", 
   "\"Notice that because an edge in an undirected graph is a set, {a, b}={b, a}, and since E4  is also a set, it cannot contain more than one instance of a given edge. Another consequence of Definition  is that there cannot be an edge from a node to itself in an undirected graph because an edge is a set of size two and a set cannot contain duplicates\"",
