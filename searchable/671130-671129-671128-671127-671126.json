   "Modified HttpCoreNIOListener such that when the start() method returns, it is guaranteed that the listener is ready to accept requests. This was not the case previously because the whole startup procedure was executed in a separate thread. Now the initialization is done in the thread executing the start method and only the I/O reactor's execute method is executed in a separate thread. After starting this thread, start() waits for the endpoint to become ready (using ListenerEndpoint#waitFor) so that the postcondition of the start method is that the listener accepts requests. This change allows unit tests to have a more predictable behavior. It also allows the listener to report problems during startup back to the listener manager."
