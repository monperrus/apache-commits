   "Instead of building a bundled signature JAR for forbidden-apis, package our own Maven plugin based on forbidden-apis. This is more convenient and works around the issue described in https://code.google.com/p/forbidden-apis/issues/detail?id=13. Note that for this we need to create a shaded JAR for forbidden-apis with the existing Mojos removed."
