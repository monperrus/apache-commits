   "Improve calculation in the 'get all other items' methods. If an item is not preferred by anybody who has at least one item coocurring with the current user, then it can't possibly be recommended by any existing algorithm. By building up the set of possibilities more intelligently, a lot of work can be saved. Speed up was 50-400% in a couple tests using an item-based recommender. Made similar changes and refinements to related code across the board. (Thanks Gokhan)"
