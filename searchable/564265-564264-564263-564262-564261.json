   "Refactored revision control: clean up XML reading+writing. RCML objects are now singletons per source URI. This allows to synchronize access per RCML object, avoiding synchronization issues which occured when running load tests. UnitOfWork.commit() and rollback() are now synchronized via the class object to avoid inter-usecase commit synchronization issues (also occured during load tests)."
