   "OPENJPA-1491 When used in an OSGi environment with Apache Aries, the org.apache.openjpa.kernel.Bootstrap should use the OpenJPA bundle classloader instead of the application bundle classloader to instatiate a BrokerFactory.  Also moved our BundleActivator from the openjpa module to openjpa-persistence module with a BundleUtils wrapper to remove direct OSGi class refs, so the BundleContext in it could be accessed by PersistenceProviderImpl."
