   "Two bugs are fixed in this patch:", 
   "1) A plug-in module with no configuration options caused the broker to crash when the module was loaded.", 
   "2) Failure to load a module called out in --load-module now causes the broker to exit. Failure to load a module via --load-dir is logged but does not cause the broker to exit."

   "Added support for the natural language indentifier (\"Lang\" in the document catalog) for PDF documents based on the language/country values on fo:page-sequence. This required a few changes in the AreaTreeModel and the Renderer interface because it didn't support passing through the PageSequence object, only its title. Now, we can put other values on the PageSequence and transport them to the renderers."
