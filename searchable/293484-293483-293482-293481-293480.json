   "DERBY-558: Fix optimizer hang seen for large queries with exists-joins.", 
   "The patch does the following:", 
   "1) Fixes the logic in OptimizerImpl.java that was causing the hang (an indirect infinite loop).", 
   "2) Adds some comments describing the \"JUMPING\" logic that is in OptimizerImpl so that developers looking at the code can (hopefully) figure out what's going on more quickly in the future.", 
   "3) Adds a test case to the lang/subqueryFlattening.sql test for verification of the fix. The test case is based on the repro attached to this issue. NOTE: I had to set the \"derby.optimizer.noTimeout\" property to true for this entire test--I think this is okay since everything still passes (on my machine), but if anyone feels otherwise, please let me know...",
