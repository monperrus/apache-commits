   "Partial fix for CONNECTORS-109.  The full fix requires a feature in Derby that is on Derby's trunk but not yet in a release.  Fix the report queries for queue status and result report that were due to use of the postgresql-only function 'SUBSTRING'.  I also needed to restructure these queries because the GROUP BY columns are not allowed to be return column names in Derby."
