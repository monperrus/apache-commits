   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JS2-660", 
   "I am checking Woonsan's patch, as his team has been doing in-depth parallel load testing and uncovered issues related to 660.", 
   "Summary:", 
   "- added getAttributeNames() method and removeAttribute() method for org.apache.jetspeed.engine.servlet.ServletRequestImpl.", 
   "- added cachedAttributes member to cache request attribute map.", 
   "If no attribute is added, changed, or removed, the cached map will be used in jsp pages.", 
   "- added another routine for getting attribute in getAttribute() method.", 
   "Because PortletRequestImpl class of pluto encodes the name of attribute before calling setAttribute(), we have to check the encoded name also.", 
   "I reviewed Nicolas's patch. It is close to Woonsan's code, but there is extra code (2 lines) from Nicolas...", 
   "Not clear to me why this is needed, as \"pr\" is not used. Commenting out for now...", 
   "PortletRequest pr = (PortletRequest) super.getAttribute(\"javax.portlet.request\");", 
   "if (pr != null)"
