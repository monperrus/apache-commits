   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQNET-471", 
   "Resolve issues around transaction rollback during normal operation or during a failure detected with the FailoverTransport handling reconnection.  Issues involving false positives of duplicate redelivery and messages not being properly re-added to the unconsumed channel after rollback were fixed.  Also added logic to attempt to detect delivery of rolled back messages to another consumer on the same connection which requires the TX be rolled back as invalid."
