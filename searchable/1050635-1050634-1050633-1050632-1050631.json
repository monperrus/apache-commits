   "The HTTP transport makes the assumption that if useSeparateListener=true, then the response is always a 202. This is not always true, e.g. when WS-RM is used. Fixed to code so that the HttpMethod is always stored in the MessageContext if the response code is not 202. This is necessary (but maybe not sufficient) to ensure proper cleanup of the connection."
