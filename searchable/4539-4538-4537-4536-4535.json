   "bug 1460: bayes_expiry_use_scan_count is now the default, using a method that should not be much slower than using the time.  This now means that expiry can take place during a mass-check, which is very important.  Implementation uses a separate file, bayes_msgcount, to track scan-count.  This will not require rescanning the bayes dbs."
