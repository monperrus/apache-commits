   "TRINIDAD-1383: Update to support latest changes in portlet-bridge.", 
   "This patch fixes the above Portal related bugs for Trinidad.  Here is what was done:", 
   "* The portlet bridge api was added to the Trinidad API project which now uses the bridge's @ExcludeFromManagedRequestScope annotaton on the RequestStateMap", 
   "* Added a new RequestStateMap utility that has a request map which spans one action request and the following render request.  Most of the configurator state was enhanced to use this map.", 
   "* Fixed a problem in ExternalContextUtils where it was incorrectly identifying action requests in a portal environment if the RenderRequest was a subclass of the ServletRequest object", 
   "* Fixed an encoding issue before the redirect in the CoreRenderkit", 
   "Thanks to Felix, Robert, and Nathan for finding these issues, submitting patches, and helping to test the final fixes."
