   "Final patch to migrate common code from \"gadgets\" to \"common\" artifact. This patch moves the actual source from java/gadgets to java/common. Moved ContentFetcher bindings back into gadgets since they are not a common dependency any longer, and removed unnecessary dependency on gadgets.http.HttpGuiceModule from social-api test cases.", 
   "All common code from this point forward belongs in common. The \"gadgets\" artifact should never depend on \"social-api\", and \"social-api\" should never depend on \"gadgets\"."
