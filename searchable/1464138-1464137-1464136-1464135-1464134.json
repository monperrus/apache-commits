   "[HBASE-8245] Throttle region opens", 
   "Author: manukranthk", 
   "Summary: By throttling the region reassignments when a region server come back up after his regions are spread out, we can reduce the spiked in get latencies caused due to multiple region opens on the same region server at round about the same time.", 
   "Test Plan: Push onto Titan Shadow's master and cause a RegionServer failure and bring him up after a while. By going through the logs we can understand the working of the idea.",

   "[0.89-fb] [HBASE-8228] grab HLog.cacheFlushLock.writeLock() only while swapping the writers", 
   "Author: aaiyer", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Saw a few scenarios in TitanShadow025 where the snapshot() took long. In all", 
   "the cases that I saw, this was because there was a RollWriter happening in", 
   "parallel. And, the rollWriter itself was blocked on a NN-failover.", 
   "We do not expect NN failover to be happening in prod. But there is no reason", 
   "why the rollWriter() should be holding the writeLock() when trying to create", 
   "the new HLog/DUMMY write. This is done outside the updatesLock because it", 
   "is not crutial.", 
   "The crutial part is when we swap the oldWriter for the newWriter, created.", 
   "We need to ensure that we grab the HLog.cacheFlushLock.writeLock() also for", 
   "this period only.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "MR unit tests; push to titanshadow and look for the times it takes", 
   "to cause snapshots.",
