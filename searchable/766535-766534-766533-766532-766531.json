   "WikiPageTypeConverter's behavior changed. Unless the string passed to convert() is a special page, WikiPageTypeConverter is now guaranteed to return a WikiPage (which may or may not be persisted in the repository). SpecialPage names still cause the converter to return null, by design. The result of this change is that editing/viewing functions don't \"break\" if the page doesn't exist."
