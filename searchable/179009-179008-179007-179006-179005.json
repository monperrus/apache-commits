   "Added the multipart support. Note: The WSDL 2.0 does not identify a notion of Multipart. It has a messagereference which will point to a QName in the schema types section of the WSDL. If the parsing WSDL 1.1 has a multipart how it will be handled is in the following manner. The type or the element of the individual parts will be extracted and a new complex type will be formed containing those elements as the complexcontent. If a given message is reused in a operation then the same Qname will be used which refer to the same complextype. THe name of the New Complextype will be that of the WSDl 1.1 Message."
