   "This patch implements a new SAX's entity resolver that will re-direct any remote schema/dtd locally. The patch  implements a workaround for the warning problem when using Xerces 2.0.1. It also supports the current Xerces nightly build. I was unable to find a workaround for the StackOverflowException when using Xerces 2.0.2. At least we have one Xerces released version that work (very slow, that's why I am going to start adding validation switch on/off :-)).",
