   "Applied patch from Karl Eilebrecht, cleaned up by Adrian Crum, to fix startup issues in SQL Server and other databases, including the latest version of Derby which I'll now put in here; after the patch I made a few changes to keep the stuff that tries to get data for all tables in one call as that tends to perform MUCH faster on certain databases, but now checks for errors and will try other methods as needed; right now this is only being done for primary key info, but the same pattern could be applied in other places if needed (and it may very well be); this should close Jira #OFBIZ-1020"
