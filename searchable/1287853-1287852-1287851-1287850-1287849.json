To turn TLF markup -- in either String or XML form -- into a TextFlow, use the static importFromString() and importFromXML() methods in the TextFlowUtil class. These are bindable methods so that if the markup parameter changes they will re-evaluate. To turn the TextFlow back into markup, use TextFLowUtil.export(...) to produce XML.", 
   "The 'content' property is now intended only for use by the MXML compiler. It is set-only and only supports being set to what MXML markup produces: a String (which will be treated as the text of an implicit span in an implicit paragraph), a FlowElement, or an Array of Strings and FlowElements.", 
   "The 'text', 'textFlow', and 'content' properties are interacting properties. For example, you can set 'textFlow' and then get the 'text', and vice versa. In fact, you can now do this immediately, without waiting for the component to undergo a LayoutManager pass. Of these three properties, the last one set in ActionScript wins; if more than one is set in MXML the results are undefined since MXML does not guarantee the order in which properties are set. Setting any of them to null is equivalent to setting the 'text' to the empty String, which is the initial state of the component.",

   "The default for the 'dominantBaseline' style, as set in the global selector, is now \"auto\", as it is now in TLF, instead of \"roman\". In TLF, a value of \"auto\" means \"ideographicCenter\" if the 'locale' is Japanese (i.e., starts with \"ja\") or Chinese (i.e., starts with \"zh\"), and \"roman\" otherwise. SimpleText now implements this same logic.",

   "The default for the 'justificationStyle' style, as set in the global selector, is now \"auto\", as it is now in TLF, instead of \"pushInKinsoku\".

   "The default for the 'tabStops' style, as set in the global selector, is now null. Previously it was omitted from the global selector and the default value was therefore undefined.", 
   "The 'tracking' style has been removed. (The 'trackingLeft' and 'trackingRight' styles remain.) A 'tracking' attribute was defined in FXG 1.0 but FTE instead implemented trackingLeft and trackingRight properties. So when compiling FXG 1.0, the compiler will (soon) map 'tracking' to 'trackingRight', and 'tracking' will not be supported in MXML. SimpleText no longer pays any attention to a 'tracking' style.", 
   "The 'leadingModel' style can now be set to \"ascentDescentUp\", as in TLF. The default remains \"auto\".",
