   "cleaned up compound mappers. deprecated convenience mount methods in application; they no longer make sense since request mappers can be chained in front of each other potentially providing multiple mounting points in the url scheme so the application can no longer know where to mount the page. this change does require the users to know about MountedMapper directly but i dont think it is a big deal"
