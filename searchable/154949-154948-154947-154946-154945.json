   "first batch of fixes based on link-checking script. Configuration had a typo 'commons-commons'. Daemon doesn't have commons- at the front. DBCP had typo of version number, I did 2.1.1 instead of 1.2.1. JEXL doesn't have binaries/source directories. Modeler doesn't have commons- at front. Transaction uses .tgz. ECS had -src in wrong place. JMeter uses _src. Lucene had -src in wrong place. ORO doesn't have a -src at all in its src download. Slide had duplicated extra bad lines and the jca link was typo'd."
