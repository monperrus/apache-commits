   "present OR if there is no other mapping registered in that direction.", 
   "* Mapping from xmlsoap:Map is now to HashMap, not Map.  We still happily", 
   "serialize any Map to an xmlsoap:Map, but the deser mapping goes to the", 
   "concrete class.", 
   "* Add \"isConvertable()\" method to JavaUtils.", 
   "* ServiceDesc is now much smarter about introspecting.  We introspect once", 
   "for each method that we're interested in, and methods which never get called", 
   "typically won't ever get introspected for.", 
   "* Implement \"synchronizing\" OperationDescs which have been generated from",

   "in the OperationDesc.  See next couple of bullets for why this is cool.", 
   "* RPCProvider method search + dispatch code is now *much* cleaner.  We rely", 
   "on \"early binding\" to dispatch to the correct method via a ServiceDesc,", 
   "so by the time we've deserialized the RPCElement successfully, we know", 
   "exactly which OperationDesc (and hence which Java Method) we're dealing with.", 
   "That enables us to simply set up the parameters and call it.", 
   "* RPCHandler now checks any actually received xsi:types against what is", 
   "expected/desired by the appropriate ParameterDesc, and throws a fault", 
   "if it can't map them.", 
   "* RPCElement doesn't try to introspect every time anymore, it just makes sure", 
   "the ServiceDesc has the right typemapping and implementation class if", 
   "appropriate.  Then getOperationsByName() will introspect if necessary.", 
   "* JavaDeployWriter now writes out <parameter> information into the WSDD", 
   "* Put in missing mapping in samples/echo service, and put an <operation>", 
   "into the deploy.wsdd so we get the OUT parameters right for", 
   "echoStructAsSimpleTypes()", 
   "* Enable accessing a Call's TypeMapping via getTypeMapping() - relies on the", 
   "encodingStyle being set correctly.", 
   "* Remove various try/catch blocks which were obscuring exceptions in tests.", 
   "Tests in general should throw exceptions (and their associated stack traces)", 
   "instead of eating them, unless there's a good reason to eat them.", 
   "* Move code which understands primitives/wrappers into JavaUtils, since it's", 
   "generally handy"
