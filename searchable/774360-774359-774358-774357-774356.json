   "- Some misc code improvements as well in this area", 
   "- In particular, WSDataRef now holds a reference to the decrypted DOM element", 
   "- The \"URI\" of WSDataRef is now the *referencing* URI. I removed the practise of appending the wsu:Id to the decrypted element as this is bad practise IMO."
