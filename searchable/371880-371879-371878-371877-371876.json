   "- Added task to browse a queue for messages that includes the ability to query for selected messages only, and specify the properties to view. (Still considering adding one for topics too)", 
   "- Redesigned the querying mechanism to allow easy insertion and/or extension of specific querying filters", 
   "- Redesigned the output mechanism to allow easy inclusion of different output formatters (i.e. output in command shell friendly format, script friendly format, xml format, etc.)", 
   "- Currently have just included a not-so-friendly command shell formatter. :) Have plans to modify this and maybe include an xml formatter and/or script friendly formatter.", 
   "PS: I plan to move the console package outside activemq-core and include some unit tests with it sometime in the very near future. I know its kinda messy right know. :)"
