   "The dataGroup skin part holds the layout value. The layout was null when the DropDownList was closed because the dataGroup only exists when the DropDownList is open. The fix is to override the layout getter and return VerticalLayout if the dataGroup doesn't exist.", 
   "SDK-20850 - DropDownList dispatches open event before dropDown is visible on screen", 
   "The skin update was changed from synchronous to asynchronous, so the open event was dispatched too early. We now wait for UPDATE_COMPLETE before sending the open or close events.",

   "The skin update was changed from synchronous to asynchronous, so the dataGroup skin part didn't exist when we tried to auto-scroll. We now wait for UPDATE_COMPLETE before auto-scrolling.", 
   "SDK-20810 - DropDownList does not display color style correctly when set to white", 
   "The labelElement was getting colorized to the baseColor. The DropDownListSkin has been changed to subclass Skin instead of SparkSkin. There are no visuals in the DropDownListSkin that need any of the SparkSkin functionality.",
