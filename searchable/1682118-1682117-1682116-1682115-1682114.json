   "This closes \"Replace bsh code with Groovy code\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-6332 with all its subtasks and more.", 
   "jleroux: I suspected it was only a matter of replacing \"${bsh\" by \"${groovy\" in *.xml. But I had not the guts to get into 11(!) sub tasks.", 
   "So, in Eclipse, I simply did a S/R in *.xml and compared parts of my changes with some Pierre's most \"complex\" patches respectively product, ebaystore, projectmgr and scrum.", 
   "They were totally similar (just revisions number changed) so here is the whole.", 
   "I will later improve these changes by removing HTML entities when possible, this is a bit more delicate because in some cases the XML schema are not complete (or/and for other still obscure to me reasons) and if you simply replace HTML entities by simple code (eg &Amp; by &) you get issues in logs when the XML parser cross them...", 
   "Note: only menus, screen and forms are changed here."
