   "Moved the bi component from specialpurpose to the framework folder; moved artifacts from the bi component to the proper components.", 
   "Everything should be in place now, except for a convenience service (in the bi component) that quickly initializes the datawarehouse for demo purposes: this service calls two services from the applications (wrong dependency); I will fix this soon by moving it in some other places... however it is not a big deal for now because the service is really only useful to quickly test the prototype."
