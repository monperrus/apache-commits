   "Adding ApachConUS2009 info on portals homepage with images and descriptions for the Jetspeed Training by myself and Presentation by David.", 
   "NB: I also tried to add the same to the Jetspeed-2 homepage, but that is generated with maven-2 (2.0.x), and maven 2.0.x doxia plugin screws it up because it strips all style/class attributes from images :(", 
   "Seems newer doxia plugin used by maven 2.1.x has this resolved but migrating jetspeed-2 site generation for just this purpose was a bit too much work to do right now.", 
   "So, I resorted to manually add this to the generated index.html ...", 
   "I've uploaded the modified index.html and images for both portals general and jetspeed-2 site so this should become live and visible in a few hours."
