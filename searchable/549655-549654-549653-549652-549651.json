   "In summary, the followings are expected:", 
   "- One can add a portlet preferences validator class into the portlet.xml. The class is a wrapper class for groovy script.", 
   "- The wrapper class reads (read-only) preferences to find the script file and auto-refresh mode.", 
   "- When auto-refresh mode is true, the modification of the validator script should be applied instantly.", 
   "- Also, one can write a groovy portlet to support pre-286 header phase. Currently Jetspeed-2 API provides this interface. So the script developer implements SupportsHeaderPhase interface of Jetspeed-2 to provide header phase.", 
   "- In such case, the developer can set the portlet-class to another wrapper class."
