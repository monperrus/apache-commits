   "The basedir system property is the one property that Maven passes through to unit tests.  It is the full path to the projects base directory so information tests need can be referenced easily.  Changed the MavenTools test to use the property instead of assuming the test was being executed in the projects basedir.  Emacs/jde uses -find on the ant command-line and therefore the cwd may not be the same directory where build.xml is."
