   "Fix for bugs in many of the MyFaces website pages that causes a horizontal scroll bar to be displayed even though there should be enough space to not have one.", 
   "The problem is that the \"Apache MyFaces\" image being displayed inside of the \"banner\" element is 210px wide but the container DIV that is floated to the right was being set to 200px so there will always be 10 few pixels and thus a horizontal scroll bar:",

   "http://myfaces.apache.org/img/banners/apache_banner.png", 
   "Now, with 210px being allocated to this \"banner\" element, there will always be enough space regardless of which image is being placed in the DIV."
