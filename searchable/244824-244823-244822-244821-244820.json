   "avoiding classpath problems for deployers.", 
   "3) Introduce a custom post-complilation build step which will", 
   "invoke the \"post-compile.xml\" file if it's present.  This allows", 
   "developers to do custom work (primarily copying the jar,", 
   "perhaps restarting servers, etc) after the axis.jar is built."
