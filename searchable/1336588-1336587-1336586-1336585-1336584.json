   "#119125# Completely changed XFillBitmapItem to work wit GraphicObject, removed XOBitmap class, adapted all usages (also the pretty old 8x8 pixel editor). All Bitmap fill styles will now accept transparent bitmaps as fillings in all variations (tiled, etc.). LoadSave is no problem, ODF defines graphic as content for fill. Backward means that OOs before this change will use a white background ofr fill with transparent, same as the fallback all the time when using a transparent fill. This is also a preparation to e.g. offer SVG or Metafiles as fill style."
