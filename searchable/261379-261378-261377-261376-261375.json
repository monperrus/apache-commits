   "AXISCPP-657 Load the channel libraries during ModuleInitialize. This improves performance by avoiding unnecessary loading and unloading and solves stress test problems on AIX with dlopen. SOAPTransportFactory::initialize calls preloadChannels which is a C-style function on the transport library. preloadChannels calls ChannelFactory::preloadChannels which is static and so can be called long before the transport object exists."
