   "CAMEL-806: Introduced isLenientProperties() on Endpoint to allow http based components to run in non strict URI parameter mode, so you are able to add dynamic URI reguest parameters on the URI configured endpoint. This of course also applies for other types of components that needs this kind of behavior. Thanks to Stephan for the unit test to verify the bug."
