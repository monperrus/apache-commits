   "Introduce the notion of a DialogStateMapper which maps dialog state IDs to JSF view IDs.", 
   "* The current FacesContext is available to this mapping, so it is possible to support multiple sets of views over user agents, modalities, locales, user roles etc. (ofcourse, the latter two on rare occassions) and share the same dialog \"controller\".", 
   "* The default behavior is an identity transform, the state ID is used as-is as the view ID (a leading slash is added, if needed)", 
   "* That behavior can be changed by replacing the application scope bean (which implements DialogStateMapper) at key \"org$apache$shale$dialog$scxml$STATE_MAPPER\"",
