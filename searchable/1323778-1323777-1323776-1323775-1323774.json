   "* The bulk of speedup comes from Parser.java and Scanner.java (easily the 99% case) -- when parsing AS3.", 
   "* Makes IO more consistent, we no longer have any instances of StringBuffer, and no longer need to think about whether there is a perf benefit of using one or the other. Always use StringBuilder.", 
   "* As Sun improves the JREs, synchronization overhead will decrease, and the benefit of this change will become less apparent. However, this is not the case with Java 1.5, our target JRE.",
