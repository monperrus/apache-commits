   "Workaround for \"Lookups (layered mode) and dropdown menus overlap\" (in BizznessTime Theme) https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-5519", 
   "A good example is in order creation page, open the customer lookup and then try to close it.", 
   "I think we should not fiddle with the theme, there is a faster and easier solution: center all lookups in the screen by default. It will not fix but hide the issue for now. Anyway the awful dropdown menu behaviour must be fixed and i will open another Jira for that.", 
   "You may ask why I'm concerned with a theme which is no longer bundled in future releases? It's because some custom projects still use it..."
