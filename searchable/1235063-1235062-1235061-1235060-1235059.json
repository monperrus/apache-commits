   "Fixed an issue in Rampart that occured because it was implicitly relying on a non-conformance of DOOM's DOM implementation.", 
   "The issue occurs if all of the following conditions are satisfied:", 
   "1. The service uses DOOM to create the response message.", 
   "2. The content of the response message is prepared using the DOM API and no provisions are made to ensure that the object model is well formed with respect to namespaces (i.e. that all namespace declarations are present).", 
   "3. The response message is signed or encrypted by WSS4J/Santuario.", 
   "In practice these conditions are only satisfied by Rampart's STS."
