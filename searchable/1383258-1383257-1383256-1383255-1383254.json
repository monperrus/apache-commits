   "AXIS-2875: Set the appropriate system properties so that the SAAJ unit tests can be executed on Java 1.6 (and actually test the Axis SAAJ implementation). This is necessary because Axis doesn't contain META-INF/services/* resources for SAAJ. Note that we don't want to add these files because this would likely cause issues for applications that use both Axis 1.x and SAAJ 1.3."
