   "Added RAT report generation tasks as part of the release build tasks (see WOOKIE-201); to avoid duplication in the configuration I also put the \"includes\" list for the source build into a separate Ant patterns file referenced by both the zip and RAT report tasks. Note that the RAT report tasks require the RAT jars and their dependencies to be available in ANT HOME."
