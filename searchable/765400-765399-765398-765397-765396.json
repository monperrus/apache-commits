   "Adding a convenience method getAllFeatures() to Gadget, which returns a dependency-ordered list, in \"ascending\" (root dependencies first) order. Will assist in making it possible for gadgets to include transitive dependencies and have them pull in dependent functionality when such functionality isn't JS-based (eg. locked-domain). Resolves SHINDIG-969.",
