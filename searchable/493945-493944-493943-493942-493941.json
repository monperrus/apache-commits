   "Use a <resource> element to include the LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files in the jar. The antrun plugin (which was copying in those files) has a bug that causes it execute twice if used in both a parent and dependant pom. The only downside to using a <resource> element is that its not inherited if dependant poms also specify any <resource> elements and therefore needs to be duplicated in dependant poms in that scenario"
