   "Update gadgets.rpc Flash transport implementation to use a combination of child ID and rpc token for communication. A type coercion bug is also fixed. These updates ensure that cross-domain messages don't get mis-delivered or confused, as Flash's runtime spans not only tabs/Windows but browsers as well. All communication tests in the rpc tests (slight edits to it as well) now work, including child-in-child, echo, and batched requests."
