   "Moreover, there are some other cleanups.  We now support null items.  Item renderers are strongly typed as IVisualElements now (an item renderer must be an IVisualElement and a DisplayObject).  We also don't dispatch events when changing the itemRenderer or itemRendererFunction anymore as there's no need to do it and no need to make these properties bindable.",

   "This change will allow us to handle having the same items multiple times in the list, for example \u201cRyan Frishberg\u201d can now be in the list twice.", 
   "In order to do it, rather than using the item to find the itemRenderer or to tell the list that an item\u2019s been selected, we need to use the index instead.  Methods like getItemRenderer and getRendererItem were changed to accept an index rather than an item.  Other methods were added, like isItemIndexSelected() because I felt isItemSelected() is still a useful method to have, even though it\u2019s ambiguous when multiple items come in to play.", 
   "For now, I just tried to change the parameters where needed.  Some of the names of the methods were updated to reflect the change, but others weren\u2019t because PARB is going to review a lot of this on Thursday, so it\u2019s easier to make a name change only once (and after PARB approves it).", 
   "I also added properties to ItemExistanceChangeEvent.as.  In a later checkin, I\u2019ll create a separate RendererExistanceChangeEvent.as for DataGroups and use ItemExistanceChangeEvents only for IVisualElementContainers (Halo containers  will also dispatch these events).  However, this needs to be PARB reviewed, so I figured it\u2019s best to hold off on this change until later.", 
   "Also included in this checkin are some small ASDoc updates to no longer use any of the \u201caddItem(), numItems\u201d, and instead use addElement() or numElements where appropriate.",

   "Mostly rename changes.  IVisualItem -> IVisualElement.  IVisualContainer -> IVisualElementContainer.  Also changed the APIs so that it's addElement, removeElement, etc.. instead of addItem, removeItem, etc...  Moreover, all of these APIs have been added to IVisualElementContainer (not just the read-only ones).  Now there's a common interface for all containers (even Halo's Container class implements it).  There's no more need to do:", 
   "if (x is Group || x is FxContainer)", 
   "Just use the IVisualElementContainer interface.", 
   "Some classes, like FxScroller (and perhaps DataGroup/FxDataContainer), will only implement the \"getter\" part of the API.  For now, if you call the mutation methods, we will throw an exception.  Perhaps later we'll add a separate interface for the read-only portion and the mutator interface will extend that one.", 
   "There might be a few more places in the code that need to be updated to use the new names for the methods.  I know Mustella needs cleaning up so it doesn't use getItem and uses getElement instead.  I've left the old APIs in there exactly for this purpose, so we can gradually move over to the new names (esp. QA).", 
   "At some point soon, we will remove the old methods as well as type them more strictly to only accept IVisualElements, for example addElement(element:IVisualElement).  Part of this work is dependent on updating the Flash Component Kit so that it implements IVisualElement (and perhaps IVisualElementContainer for containers).",
