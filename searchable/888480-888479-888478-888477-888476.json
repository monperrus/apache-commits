   "Provided test in JMSDestintationTest. This test requires a broker that supports both 0-8/9 and 0-10 as we must first use a 0-10 connection to send a message, which does not set JMS_QPID_DESTTYPE, then receive the message on 0-8/9. This allows us to validate that messages recieved without JMS_QPID_DESTTYPE set will can correctly set the value without a BufferOverflow Exception when simply forwarding the message.",
