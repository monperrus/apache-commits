   "when scale is applied", 
   "UITextField and UIFTETextField were returning incorrect values for measuredHeight and measuredWidth when an ancestor was scaled.", 
   "UITextField works around a quirk of a scaled TextField. When using device fonts, textWidth and textHeight return a value modified by scale (when it really shouldn't).", 
   "I\u2019ll use the term \"scaledWidth\" and \"scaledHeight\" to represent the actual pixel dimensions of a scaled textField. This is the dimensions of the textField as it appears on the screen.", 
   "textWidth = scaledWidth / scaleX", 
   "textHeight = scaledHeight / scaleX", 
   "To calculate the unscaled textWidth and textHeight, we need to multiply textWidth and textHeight by scaleX / scaleY.", 
   "unscaled textWidth = textWidth * scaleX / scaleY", 
   "unscaled textHeight = textHeight * scaleX / scaleY", 
   "UIFTETextField properly returns textWidth and textHeight properties even when scaled. So measuredWidth and measuredHeight can just use textWidth and textHeight when using device or embedded fonts.", 
   "DateChooser was measuring and laying itself out before it was added to the stage (which is true for all components in an application). Thus it was not getting the correct measurements for the month and year textFields. The fix is to listen for the addedToStage event and invalidate our size if scaleX or scaleY != 1.",
