   "Updated OS.pm::create_text_file to create a temporary file on the management node and copy it to the computer if the file is large or if the initial echo command attempt fails.", 
   "Added create_text_file and get_file_contents subroutines to ManagementNode.pm. These use Perl's IO methods rather than calling cat or echo on the OS. This allows larger file sizes than the echo method.", 
   "Added a warning handler to the eval block in run_ssh_command. This should catch some errors such as 'Argument list too long'. Also added a check to make sure $ssh_output is defined after the eval block executes.", 
   "Updated OS.pm::set_text_file_line_endings to retrieve the contents of the file, update lines, then recreate the file instead of using sed. The sed command was producing inconsistent line endings.", 
   "Other", 
   "Updated code in OS.pm::execute and utils.pm::run_ssh_command that relates to calling execute_new. It will not use execute_new for shutdown and reboot commands."
