   "Refactored GenericDelegator:", 
   "1. Converted GenericDelegator to an interface. We already have DelegatorInterface, but it isn't being used anywhere. Removed DelegatorInterface.java.", 
   "2. Extracted the static, cached data from the GenericDelegator implementation and put it in its own class - DelegatorData. The GenericDelegator implementation holds a reference to the DelegatorData instance. This makes it possible to have per-thread instances of GenericDelegator.", 
   "3. Replaced the ThreadLocal variables with regular variables. ThreadLocal variables are no longer needed. Client code doesn't need to be concerned with pushing and popping the GenericDelegator state.", 
   "This commit paves the way for the forthcoming ExecutionContext.", 
   "User modifications will have to replace GenericDelegator.getGenericDelegator(...) with DelegatorFactory.getGenericDelegator(...). Also, replace the push code with the new setXxx methods, and remove the pop code. If modifications used DelegatorInterface, replace that with GenericDelegator.", 
   "Aside from those changes, this commit is backwards compatible."
