   "QPID-2924 Refactor WinSDK to create separate debug and release /bin directories", 
   "This checkin gets rid of the \"d\" in the debug version of the .NET Binding org.apache.qpid.messaging.dll. It applies to the project that creates the dll and to twelve CSharp projects that use the dll.", 
   "This simple change greatly reduces the burden on customers that QPID-2924 tries to address. Now to switch between debug and release for .NET examples, the customer unpacks the correct DLLs into the \\bin directory and relinks the examples. The user does not have to remove and restore project references to the correct DLL for each project.", 
   "Note that these name changes have zero effect on a developer's view of the examples. In those .csproj files the DLL reference is resolved by a _project_ reeference and not by a DLL reference."
