   "The Clay component was previously defined as an naming container.  The html templates also assumed a naming container.  Assuming the naming container plays havoc with some components.  As part of issue SHALE-316, I've removed the requirement that Clay realizes the NamingContainer interface.  This means the developer will have to be more aware of the included template widgets making sure there are not duplicate id's.  The result will be that the html templates will be more inline with JSP Tag created views."
