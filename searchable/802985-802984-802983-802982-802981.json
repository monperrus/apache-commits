   "This patch enhances the Derby ALTER TABLE command so that it allows the", 
   "maximum length limit of a BLOB or CLOB column to be increased. The patch also", 
   "adds some new regression tests verifying the new functionality, and adjusts", 
   "the text of the ALTER TABLE error message to make it more clear that it is", 
   "legal to increase the length of a VARCHAR, BLOB, or CLOB column."
