   "The @SpamProtect annotation and SpamProtect tag are now fully functional. Any JSP that submits to a WikiActionBean whose handler method is annotated with @SpamProtect receives the protection automatically, thanks to SpamInterceptor and collaborating SpamFilter. All that is needed is to add the tag <wiki:SpamProtect /> as a child element to the <form> or <s:form> elements. The same three-way check used in the old Edit.jsp is still done: random \"trap\" parameter; random \"token\" parameter; UTF-8 check parameter. To help ActionBean unit test classes run with \"protected\" handler events, the static method TestEngine.addSpamProtectParams(MockRoundtrip) was created."
