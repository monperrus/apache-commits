   "Apply patch from Dan Armstrong for bug #55608 <fmt:bundle> tag unnecessarily buffers body content", 
   "This change prevents double buffering by returning EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE so the content is written directly to the JSP writer's buffer rather than being held in an unbounded buffer in bodyContent until doEndTag(). This reduces memory consumption especially with large bodies. As a consequence of this change, the body content may now be flushed before the end of the tag thereby committing the response. Users relying on the buffering side-effect to recover from Exceptions raised in the body should now handle them explicitly."
