   "Improvements to ConcurrentPermissions, has justified replacing Permissions in ConcurrentPolicyFile since this is now more reliable with concurrent code.  Still having problems with PolicyParser parsing standard java policy file, because of this it doesn't grant any permissions to the jar files in the jre/lib/ext directory, so it's having trouble with encryption providers.  Otherwise ConcurrentPolicyFile passes all policy based tests.  I expect the problem will be solved soon and it will then pass all qa tests.  The next step will be to replace RMISecurityManager with a DelegateSecurityManager and test that.  Then add logging to the security manager to record failed permission checks."
