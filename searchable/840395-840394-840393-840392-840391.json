   "A bunch of buildsystem fixes:", 
   "1) Fix handling of --enable and --disable arguments to configure.  Patch", 
   "submitted by Yoshiki Hayashi <yoshiki@xemacs.org>, but adapted and expanded", 
   "by me.", 
   "2) Remove garbage output from which on systems that print output when nothing", 
   "is found.  Patch submitted by Mo Dejong <supermo@bayarea.net>", 
   "3) Fix VPATH builds after breaking them when we allowed system versions of", 
   "neon and APR.  Patch submitted by Philip Martin <philip_martin@ntlworld.com>.", 
   "Tested with apr, neon, and db in tree, and with them system system installed.", 
   "4) Moved running of apr's buildconf back to autogen.sh, since it doesn't need", 
   "to be run everytime we configure.", 
   "Still to be done: fix 'make check' for vpath builds.", 
   "* ac-helpers/apr.m4: Reference the buildir and srcdir as appropriate to", 
   "allow vpath builds.  Remove running of apr/buildconf, now done by", 
   "autogen.sh if apr/buildconf exists and is executable.", 
   "* ac-helpers/svn-macros.m4: Rename variable since autoconf generated one of", 
   "the same name.  Warn if skipping a subdir config.", 
   "* ac-helpers/neon.m4: Use the sourcedir when checking neon version.  Remove", 
   "check for subdir configuration, now done by SVN_SUBDIR_CONFIG.", 
   "* autogen.sh: Supress error output from which.  Run apr/buildconf if", 
   "it exists and is executable.", 
   "* buildcheck.sh: Suppress error output from which.", 
   "* configure.in: Move setting of INSTALL and MKDIR to top, so that they", 
   "are set before being used. Test $enableval to see if --disable-subdir-config", 
   "or --enable-subdir-config were passed.  Rename variable to avoid autoconf", 
   "internal variable.  Test $enableval to see if --enable-debug or", 
   "--disable-debug was passed.  Same for maintainer-mode.  Don't allow", 
   "--disable-debug --enable-maintainer-mode. Remove -O flags globally, in case", 
   "of duplicates in --enable-maintainer-mode.  New code to remove -g flags", 
   "if --disable-debug is passed."
