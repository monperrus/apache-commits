   "Lots of improvements to the Butterfly widget including: better mobile experience using media queries viewport tag, nicer colour palette buttons, custom crayon pointer, widget resizes nicely to fill larger screens (e.g. mobile in portrait mode) with larger buttons for easier touch control. Tested on Safari, Chrome, Opera, FF, Opera Mobile. Doesn't yet work on Android Browser (but then it didn't before, either)"
