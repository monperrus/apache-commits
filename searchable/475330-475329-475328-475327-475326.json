   "OFBIZ-446: Change allocation of payment applications to invoices so that only those which are SENT or RECEIVED are applied to DISBURSEMENTS or RECEIPTS respectively.  Previously, the allocation was blind and would apply any PaymentApplication to its invoice without checking status or paymentTypeId. The use of PaymentAndApplication simplified some related code, this whole section of InvoiceServices could use a good refactoring."
