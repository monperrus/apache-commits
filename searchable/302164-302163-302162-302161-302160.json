This may break other components that were depending on them.  However that is why I'm committing now (so I can get more eyes to find the broken components).", 
   "I've kludged getScheme for now, so that Tomcat is more or less functional.  However, it looks like there is still a fair amount of cleanup to do in getting the default values set for the protocols."
