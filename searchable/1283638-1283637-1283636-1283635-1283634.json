   "New Transform effects to handle correctly doing Move, Rotate, and Scale operations simultaneously. Also, added keyframe capabilities to new effects system (necessary for the transform effects, shouldn't affect operation of other effects). Fixed various issues with effects/transition infrastructure as necessary. Added transform utility functions to UIComponent, AdvancedLayoutFeatures, and GraphicElement.",
