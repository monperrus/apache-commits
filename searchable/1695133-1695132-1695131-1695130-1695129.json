   "After r1695126, I found that most of the Java files have svn:eol-style=native. So only 116 Java files were missing svn:eol-style=native. I guess those have been added by committers who are not using the OFBiz svn config file on their machines. So rather than removing svn:eol-style=native, this commits add the property to the files which miss it. Here 116+89=205 files have their svn:eol-style property changed to native."
