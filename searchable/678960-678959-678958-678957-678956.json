   "o Fixed a big bug in SchemaInterceptor : it was possible to inject entries where the RDN attribute were not present as an attribute.", 
   "o Modified the rename() method in the SchemaInterceptor to store the \"cn=schema\" dn in the entry, otherwise the check() was failing", 
   "o Fixed the tests to forbid the creation of entries with a RDN but no associated attribute."
