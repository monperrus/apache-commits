   "* MessageBodyWriter for OWLOntology now supports n3, nt and text/plain (as n3). Code is also much slimmer. This resolves STANBOL-382", 
   "* Fixed KRType for the turtle format (text/turtle as well as application/x-turtle for pre-registration)", 
   "* Every OntoNet ontology collector resource, and ontologies therein, now respond to requests that accept RDF/XML, RDF/JSON, JSON-LD, OWL/XML, Manchester OWL, OWL Functional Syntax, Turtle, N-Triple, N3 and plain text (as N3)", 
   "* Fixed some cases where OntoNet was returning an HTTP response before it could set CORS origin (STANBOL-105)", 
   "* OntoNet root resource can now store ontologies as POST payload (first essential step of STANBOL-534)"
