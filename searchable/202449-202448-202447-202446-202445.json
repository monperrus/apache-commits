   "Resolution for http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-400 : Nice to have a way to inheriate all its JSPs members when inheriating a pageflow", 
   "This follows a thread on beehive-dev.  The basic idea is that you have a base page flow A and derived page flow B, and B sets inheritLocalPaths=true in its @Jpf.Controller.  If you go through any @Jpf.Forward or @Jpf.SimpleAction that's comes from A, and if the referenced path is local (doesn't start with '/'), then the path will be relative to A.  *The page is still run in the context of B -- B is not destroyed, and a separate instance of A is not created.*",
