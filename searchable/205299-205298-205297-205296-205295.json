   "Provided a possibility to optimize the output of the PropFindMethod, means instead of creating a large JDOM document first and then outputting the document to the response stream, any piece of the output is written to the stream as soon as it is available. This will reduce memory consumption in the case of large responses (PROPFIND on many resources). Since the output differs slightly, there is a switch in the web.xml to turn it off.",
