   "In NIX, ensures that window.location of a given call (ultimately made through the process(...) method) is equivalent to the executor of the call rather than the caller. This fixes a scenario whereby, for instance, a container on C.com with gadget on G.com provides an IFRAME-based history solution, which accesses a same-domain IFRAME on C.com. A call from G.com causing a C.com history update fails since IE thinks window.location is G.com at this point w/o the setTimeout."
