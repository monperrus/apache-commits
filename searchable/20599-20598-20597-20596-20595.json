   "* Even though the code looks different, hostnames for -i never worked. Those also fell back to 127.0.0.1 silently. Now the first available IP-address is used (or spamd dies if none is available).", 
   "* Added feature: ports can now be specified as names, too.", 
   "* Added feature: giving just the -i switch without a value will make spamd listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0). That's still limited by the host filter (given by -A)."
