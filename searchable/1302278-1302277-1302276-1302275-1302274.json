It is always good to use Debug.* statements that are having log level setup in debug.properties file. The real problem comes with Debug.log( statement when you are printing any list or map object that contains so many records(or data) in it. Here I am changing all the occurrence of Debug.log( with Debug.logInfo(, Debug.logError( or Debug.logWarning( so that we can have better control of Debug.* statements on production system. :-)"
