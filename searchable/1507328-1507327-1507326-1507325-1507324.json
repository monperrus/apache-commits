   "Introduced a 'hold until refresh' event, that can be used by listeners to defer processing events until either a 'login' or 'refresh' event occurs. The stateful target repository, which has relatively expensive refresh operations, uses this to not update its internal state whil logging in or checking out. Also, we now clean up after ourselves after logout, not holding on to checked out workspaces beyond a session. Improved some error messages and added a toString for repository objects."
