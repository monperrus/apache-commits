   "Enhanced Form Widget hyperlink type field to support a link-type of hidden-form and to be able to put parameters in a sub-element with name/value (or from-field) pairs; used the EditProductPrices page in the catalog manager as a test case, especially for the Delete ProductPrice links; also improved the URLs there with request-redirect; this is part of the effort to make things generally more secure as parameters are passed in the body and under https will be encrypted; note that this doesn't support multi type forms yet"
