   "[master] Fix map-reduce-related HBase tests", 
   "Author: mbautin", 
   "Summary: Map-reduce tests in HBase appear to be failing since the upgrade to the Alligator Hadoop branch because of Corona's dependency on Netty. Since we install the Hadoop jar into Maven in a hacky way and don't add all proper dependencies from ivy, the simplest thing to do seems to be to add Netty as a dependency to HBase directly.",
