   "* Fixed the kernel to support module version numbers in the x.y.z-qualifier format (and not just SNAPSHOT and floats). This should avoid issues like AXIS2-4034 (caused by the fact that we had to use 1.41 as version numbers for the modules released with Axis2 1.4.1) and should also allow us to get rid of the xxx.mar.version properties introduced in r553898.", 
   "* Some general cleanup of the code related to module versions.", 
   "Note that the patch changes the type of the version property in AxisModule and therefore breaks compatibility with previous versions. This is acceptable because code that uses this part of the API should be revised anyway to make sure that it uses module version numbers in the correct way."
