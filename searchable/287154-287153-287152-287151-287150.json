   "Reversed previous revision and moved server.await() into the same try/catch block as server.start(). This change, which forces Tomcat to immediately shutdown if an exception is thrown by server.initialize() or server.start(), was recommended by Remy Maucherat. Immediate shutdown of Tomcat is preferred because this behavior is consistent no matter what types of Connectors are configured for Tomcat whereas, in the previous revision, the behavior was dependent on the order of the Connectors within server.xml."
