   "The Grid Selection API will now set the caret position as well as the selection.  For SET, ADD or REMOVE ROW/CELL caret is set to that row or cell and for SET_ROWS/CELLS caret is set to the last row in indicies or the last cell (rowIndex + rowCount, columnIndex + columnCount).  I'm not sure the selection API should be setting the caret position but this is consistent with how spark list works.",
