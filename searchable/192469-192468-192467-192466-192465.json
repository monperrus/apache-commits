   "When a call is made to fetch resource list from a collection without a filer", 
   "(like the database root collection) an error is thrown. The makes writing a", 
   "generic collection browser most bothersome as you have to \"know\" that the root", 
   "collection will throw exceptions with you ask for the number of resource it", 
   "contains. A better option is to return empty constants in these cases. For", 
   "example getResourceCount() will always return 0 when called on a collection", 
   "without a filer. This patch enables that."
