   "Adapted by hand from Lon F. Binder \"CatalinaContainer Doesn't Respect <distributable/> Node for web.xml files.\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4242", 
   "Per the servlet specification, the web.xml file should allow an optional <distributable/> node to indicate that the application is clusterable. Currently, OFBiz does not respect this setting and assumes all applications should be distributed if any cluster configuration is provided in the ofbiz-containers.xml file. As a result, if, for example, the DeltaManager is enable, all applications attempt to cluster and communicate via DeltaManager.", 
   "The expected and proper functionality is to check the individual application's web.xml file for the <distributable/> node and only use the DeltaManager if found; otherwise the StandardManager should be used for sessions.", 
   "jleroux: replaced some tabs, reformatted, added a comment about <distributable/> in the *-containers.file"
