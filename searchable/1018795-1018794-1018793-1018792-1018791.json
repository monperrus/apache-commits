   "Consent#getReason now only returns non-null for a veto; the use of setReason() for allows is replaced by setDescription/getDescription; in addition if a Consent#getReason is non-null it is also guaranteed to be non-empty; InteractionResult - which is used to create consents - now behaves similarly and will return a null reason if is empty; also a NPE fix for JavaCollectionFacet; also moved some test classes around closer to the code they test and deleted empty test packages"
