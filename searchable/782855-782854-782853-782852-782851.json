   "In the past week and a half, we have had significant pain integrating the updated (RMR, early-message queueing, refactored) rpc.js into our existing deployments. The process has been extremely illuminating, highlighting the need for greatly-improved end-to-end testing of every conceivable configuration and use of this library.", 
   "I am temporarily rolling back the change to take an opportunity to review the improved version in its entirety and message some of the integration challenges we've faced - and that others may as well (the one that was ultimately most difficult for us: some containers chose to cache a many-versions-old rpc.js that, for subtle reasons, proved incompatible w/ the latest)."
