   "New feature - Page Layout Best Practices demonstration and visual theme test jig.", 
   "Based on a recent dev mailing list discussion, I added a page to the Example component that demonstrates some basic layout concepts. The idea is to display the page, then look at the screen widget definition and the HTML markup to see how the page is constructed.", 
   "The page can also be used for visual theme development - because most of the common UI elements are all on one page.", 
   "This could be improved - it needs a multi-column layout example, a tree widget example, and a form widget field group example.", 
   "Internationalization note: This commit contains new UI labels."
