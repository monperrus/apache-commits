   "Improved the ConfUtils so that it will look for all resources of the requested name, sort them by which is closest to the openejb.base, and then pick the first one.  What this does is allow for a more deterministic way to select things like users.properties, groups.properties, login.config, or embedded.logging.properties to be in the classpath severl times (perhaps once per each module being tested) and if the openejb.base is set to the path of the module currently being tested, it's files will always be chosen first."
