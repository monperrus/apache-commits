   "I am moderately concerned about the java competence level of many of the ant-user postings. While it is good that people new to java are rushing to Apache products, I feel it is important they know what a ClassNF Exception is, what a 404 error is (we do  need to fix AdminClient to be more explanatory here :), and generally people should know how to write server side code before they start writing web services.", 
   "This patch spells out the prerequisite knowledge people need. It does try and scare people, because some of these people need to know that they cannot learn these things on a big project; it is like learning crampon, ice axe and glacier skills on a heavily crevassed, high-objective-hazard alpine peak.", 
   "Also I try and get my retaliation in early on what Axis and SOAP is, and what soap isnt (RMI over XML)."
