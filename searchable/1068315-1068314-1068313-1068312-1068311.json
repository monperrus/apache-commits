   "QPID-2900: Changed SimpleAMQQueue to avoid race condition in the updating atomic QueueContext._releasedEntry. Race was between thread SubFlushRunner (or QueueRunner) executing method SimpleAMQQueue.setLastSeenEntry and the thread executing the MessageRelase command executing method SimpleAMQQueue.updateSubRequeueEntry. Bolstered the unit tests surrounding the area of change to reduce risk of regression. Overrode TestableMemoryMessageStore#close() to avoid a NPE during tearDown silently cluttering some unit test logs (including SimpleAMQQueueTest).",
