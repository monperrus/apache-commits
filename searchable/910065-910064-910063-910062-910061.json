   "Installed StripesURLContructor as the default (and only) URL constructor. URLs are constructed according to the @UrlBinding annotations in the ActionBeans. Because of the checkins svn-201 through -203, the generated URLs are identical to the ones previously generated by DefaultURLConstructor (with one or two exceptions are previously noted). In the Beta timeframe, the FileBasedActionResolver will allow URL bindings to be externalized. The other URLConstructors will be removed before Beta... but not today."
