   "Improved text hiliting.", 
   "Text selections in TextView now hilite using three CSS-settable colors. And you can control whether the selection is shown when the component doesn't have focus, and when the window isn't active.", 
   "The visibility of the selection is determined by a new 'selectionVisibility' property on TextView and FxTextBase. The allowed values -- \"whenFocused\", \"whenActive\", and \"always\" -- are available in the new TextSelectionVisibility enum class. This is similar to TextField's 'alwaysShowSelection' property but more general.", 
   "The hilite color in each of the three states is determined by the three styles selectionColor, unfocusedSelectionColor, and inactiveSelectionColor. The latter two are new in Gumbo. Note that the existing selectionColor style now applies to selected text as well as to selected list items, etc. We may decide to have unfocusedSelectionColor and inactiveSelectionColor apply to things like list items as well, but that isn't part of this checkin.", 
   "QE Notes: The blinking insertion point is now barely visible because it is the selection hilite color. I'll work with the TLF team to get it drawn in a highly-visible way. Also, the selectionColor is not getting properly computed based on the themeColor for FxApplications.",
