   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3694 - Blocked/Slow advisory consumers in duplex network connector, eventually breaks request/reply with temps. The duplex case was not acking advisory messages, so we were limited to 750! Also revisit association of producer created temp with connection as this can still get deleted before an advisory. Solution is to let gc pick up temps created in this way, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2571. Resolve contention on destination creation for producer/advisory race condition. Additional tests"
