   "LUCENE-1778: Add support for log.step setting per task type. Perviously, if you included a log.step line in the .alg file, it had been applied to all tasks. Now, you can include a log.step.AddDoc, or log.step.DeleteDoc (for example) to control logging for just these tasks. If you want to ommit logging for any other task, include log.step=-1. The syntax is \"log.step.\" together with the Task's 'short' name (i.e., without the 'Task' part)."
