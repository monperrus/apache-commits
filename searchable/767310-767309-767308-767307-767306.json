   "Change the String marshaling code to write strings in Modified UTF-8 so that the strings sent by this client are compatible with Java and C++ clients.  The Strings are encoded with a short or an int depending on size of the string and where it is being marshaled.  The strings keys or the primitive map are always written with the short size prefix, strings in the values of the map are written with an int or a short depending on length of the string.  Strings in the body of the TextMessage are written using the int size prefix always."
