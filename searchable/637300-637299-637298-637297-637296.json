   "TUSCANY-1863, TUSCANY-1907, I've added most of the files attached to these two JIRA. I've taken the liberty of removing what seem to be work files, and I've added ASF headers where I can. There are some rules files that I'm not sure about yet. I've not added the new projects to the build as we need to work with Giorgio to bring them up to speed with the latest trunk and integrate them with new features such as workspace."
