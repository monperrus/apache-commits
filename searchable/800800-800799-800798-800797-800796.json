   "LUCENE-1685: The position aware SpanScorer has become the default scorer for Highlighting. The SpanScorer implementation has replaced QueryScorer and the old term highlighting QueryScorer has been renamed to QueryTermScorer. Multi-term queries are also now expanded by default. If you were previously rewritting the query for multi-term query highlighting, you should no longer do that (unless you switch to using QueryTermScorer). The SpanScorer API (now QueryScorer) has also been improved to more closely match the API of the previous QueryScorer implementation."
