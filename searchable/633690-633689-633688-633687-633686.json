   "2. A new target 'junit-single-codeline-jars' which mirrors the 'junit-all-codeline-jars' and 'junit-system-mini-codeline-jars' targets. This target sets the classpath to your compiled jarfiles and runs 'junit-single', so if you don't want to set the classpath manually this target could be used.",
