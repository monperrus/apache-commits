   "Adding better support for deferred instantiation and states. State overrides can now correctly override targets that are instantiated after a state change.  Moving the commitment of the initial state to earlier (during commit properties), this should avoid the secondary layout pass that used to occur after applicationComplete.

Fixing an issue in Group that was causing blendMode to be stuck as 'layered' when setting alpha to 0 then resetting it to a non zero value.",
