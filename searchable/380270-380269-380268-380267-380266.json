   "Completed. This stripped version is fully compatible with the existing 5.5.15 server.xml config.", 
   "It will serve as a base line.", 
   "My plan is to maintain 5.5.x compatibility with server.xml until we start TC6 development.", 
   "However, this uses the new groupcom module, so alot of the queueing and messaging features that exists in the DeltaManager can now be safely removed and replaced with smart interceptors."
