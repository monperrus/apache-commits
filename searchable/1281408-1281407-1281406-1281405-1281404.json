   "Fix batch of bugs in DataGrid and also add basic border and background styles.", 
   "DataGrid.as - Added style metadata for borderAlpha, borderColor, borderVisible, contentBackgroundAlpha, and contentBackgroundColor.", 
   "Grid.as - Add backing variable for variableRowHeight so it doesn't depend on gridDimensions.fixedRowHeight anymore.", 
   "GridLayout.as - Modified updateTypicalCellSizes() to set the fixedRowHeight to the maximum height of the typical cells when no rowHeight is set and variableRowHeight is false. Also, measuredHeight is now calculated only using the typical item instead of the content.", 
   "GridDimensions.as - Added getTypicalContentHeight() for GridLayout to calculate the measuredHeight. Also, we now reset the data structure when the columnCount is 0.", 
   "GridColumn.as - Invalidate the grid when dataField and labelFunction are set.", 
   "GridEvent.as - Fixed misspelled event constants.", 
   "DataGridSkin.mxml - Changed background color to white, caret color to dark blue, and removed the rowBackground.",
