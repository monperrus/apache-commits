In the bug\u2019s scenario the Window component\u2019s visibility is initialized to false. Next the Window is activated. The NativeWindow\u2019s activate() method makes the NativeWindow visible. The problem is the Window component is not visible. The Window activate() function was changed to set the component\u2019s visibility to true to fix the bug.",
