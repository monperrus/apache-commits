   "Fixing a few issues with attribute handling", 
   "1. Updated the StreamingOMSerializer.java to handle attributes that do not have declared namespaces.", 
   "2. Changed the order of serializing attributes and namespaces so that namespace serializing comes first", 
   "3. StAXBuilder ignores the attribute namespace if it cannot find it through the findnamespace method. This is changed so that the namespace is declared if it is not found.", 
   "All these issues arise when using a third party pull parser such as the XMLbeans pull parser (XmlObject.newXmlStreamReader()). I'm not so keen in adding an Xbeans dependency to axiom so my guess is a relevant test case is more suitable inside Axis2 rather than Axiom!"
