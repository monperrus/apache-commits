   "Currently the JSONP binding shouldn't directly rely on the HTTP binding runtime as there is work to do to ensure that the HTTP binding has reference support and JSONP wire format support (assuming we want to go that way). For now I've ranked the JSONP provider higher than the HTTP provider so that the JSONP runtime will always pick up the JSONP provider now that the JSONP model is an instanceof both the HTTP model and the JSONP model. This should fix the NPE reported on the ML for the short term."
