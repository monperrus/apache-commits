   "Added a new org.apache.activemq.kaha.impl.asyc package that holds data manager/journal that implements both the Kaha DataManager and ActiveIO Journal interfaces.", 
   "- Initial bench marks show it to be as fast or faster than the default ActiveIO Journal.", 
   "- The bigest differentiator is that this implementation of the journal was built to also provide fast reads.", 
   "- The DataManager interface was extracted and now the KahaStore can switch between the original DataManager implementation and the new implementation in the kaha.impl.async packagge.", 
   "- Simplified the original implementation by removing the AsyncDataWriters stuff since this is largely what the new package is based on."
