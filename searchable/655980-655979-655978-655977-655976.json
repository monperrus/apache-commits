   "This commit is for DERBY-1062. Currently SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE is implemented on it's own in", 
   "OnlineCompress.java It will be nice for us to share the existing code for ALTER TABLE so we do all the", 
   "necessary checks that are already done in ALTER TABLE rather than repeat the code in OnlineCompress.", 
   "Another procedure similar to SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE is SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE and", 
   "SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE is written using the ALTER TABLE code. With this commit, I am getting rid of", 
   "OnlineCompress.java and moving the necessary code into ALTER TABLE related classes. One thing that", 
   "SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE allows is compressing tables in SYSTEM schemas. The compile code currently", 
   "throws an exception if the operation is being done on system schema for DDLs. I had to make changes", 
   "such that we allow SYSTEM schema handling in DDL.", 
   "This sharing of code also fixes the GRANT/REVOKE code for SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE. Earlier we didn't", 
   "look for permissions when letting a user issue SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE. But now since we use the", 
   "existing code in ALTER TABLE, it already handles the permission issues."
