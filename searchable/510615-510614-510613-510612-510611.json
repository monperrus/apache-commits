   "* Outbound client side policy interceptor to store the assertions of the chosen alternative in the message so that they are available to subsequent interceptors.",

   "The latter check is performed only once per endpoint, results are cached.", 
   "* Logical addressing interceptor to run after OutgoingChainSetupInterceptor to that property propagation works correctly.", 
   "* Added system test that uses a plain wsdl model (no usingAddressing attribute, no Policy attachments) and external attachments as well as minimal configuration (PolicyEngine.registerInterceptors = true) to automatically engage the addressing interceptors."
