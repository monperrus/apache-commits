   "DERBY-766 (partial) Add code to the byte code compiler to enable it to",

   "and compare the calculated max stack depth with the existing generated value.",

   "the JVM's limit into a number of smaller methods. This will replace the existing mechanisms", 
   "which are reactive, non-optimal and only work in a limited number of situations."
