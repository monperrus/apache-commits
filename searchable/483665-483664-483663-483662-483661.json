   "The dependency location report is not compatible with any released version of maven, since it requires wagon 1.0-beta-2. In order to avoid making all the project info report plugin requiring maven 2.1 do a simple check on the wagon version before enabling the dependency location section. Also add a check on to be sure that the version of the wagon provider used supports this new method. Maybe it's time to release wagon 1.0-beta-2 and include it in maven 2.0.5?"
