   "Using the traditional way of declaring Lua functions does not seem to work with NetWare (and possibly Windows too?)", 
   "Thus, at least until we find a smarter way, we have to move the r:* functions into lua_request.c and connect them from there.", 
   "The only functional change is that the transferred functions are now called through the request object instead of the apache2 package.", 
   "The distinction between what merited it to be in either structure seems very vague, so for now, we'll keep the HTTP return codes in the apache2 table, and the request/server functions in the request object."
