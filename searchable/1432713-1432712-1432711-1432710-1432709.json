   "Build destabilized by 'SPOOFED_URL_HOST depends on T_URL_SHORTENER which is nonexistent' - split khopesh URL_SHORTENER into __subrule and scored rule and fix dependencies to stabilize the build. KAM, darxus and Adam please review these rules. Also, URL_SHORTENER is explicitly marked 'nopublish' so this problem should have manifested much earlier - 'nopublish' rules appear to still be leaking out."
