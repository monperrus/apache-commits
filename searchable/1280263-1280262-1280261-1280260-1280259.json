   "1)  Changed the text getter to get the text cached in the textContainerManager rather than the text cached in RichEditableText in all cases except when displayAsPassword is true since the textContainerManager has the password char and not the text and when there is a pending text, textFlow or content change which means the textContainerManager doesn't have the current text.    This change will fix all the IME bugs having to do with a missing character since the caches were not in sync when the IME was used.", 
   "2)  Changed the behavior of the text setter to preserve the selection if FlexVersion.compatibilityVersion > FlexVersion.VERSION_4_5.  selectRange will clamp the selection to valid anchor and active positions so it handles the case where the amount of text decreases.  Glenn ok'ed this change in behavior.  TLF is going to add this behavior for us in TLF3 and I will rework the code in RET to use that instead.  SDK-30948 is the tracking bug for this.  A side-effect of this change is that the numeric stepper looks much better now since the cursor isn't reset to 0 on each step.", 
   "3)  Changed CURRENT_VERSION in FlexVersion to 4.6 for now.  There is an open bug on this to track this so if the final version ends up being different we can change it later.", 
   "QE notes: need some IME testing done - 2 text tests excluded have to be updated for new behavior", 
   "Doc notes: Change in behavior of text setter.  Selection is now maintained as it is for TextField.",
