  "msg": [
   "Added ability to highlight search match text in the table (per-log panel preference, enabled by default)", 
   "- modified the Rule.evaluate method to accept a Map argument.  If the map argument is not null, the map will be populated with text matches resulting from the rule evaluation - the keys are the field names containing text matches discovered during rule evaluation, the values are the (possibly multiple) text matches", 
   "- updated Chainsaw & receivers pom.xml to require log4j-extras 1.1 snapshot due to the change to the Rule API", 
   "- renamed JEditorPaneFormatter to JTextComponentFormatter", 
   "- modified the Search match color in the table from black background to grey background, from white foreground to black foreground", 
   "- reworked concurrency & use of event lists in ChainsawCyclicBufferTableModel", 
   "- added search matches to extendedloggingevent (used during rendering)", 
   "- updated findnext/previous logic to handle no selected row, better handling of wrapping forward & back", 
   "- reworked tablecellrenderer logic to support bolding of search-match text in the table (required changing multiline fields to use a jtextpane)", 
   "- updated all Rules to accept a Map which is populated by String keys representing the fields providing a text match, and Set values containing the one or more text matches for that field (if the map is null, no collection of results is performed)", 
   "- updated And, Or and Not rules to correctly aggregate text match results of their child rules", 
   "- updated ExpressionRule to allow definition of expressions containing keywords as text (must be single-quoted)"
