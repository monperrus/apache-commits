   "Patch from HARMONY-4801 ([classlib][awt] Performance improvement for java.awt.Color.ColorPaintContext) was applied. Since the patch itself is small and obvious I don't think it should be considered as a real \"improvement\" or \"feature\". The phrase \"performance fix\" better describes it. This way, our feature freeze should not affect it IMO."
