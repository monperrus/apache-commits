   "TUSCANY-2931 - allow separate request and response wire formats in binding.jms. The tuscany binding.jms XSD has been extended to allow a response wireFormat element to be specified. The knock on effect of all this is that the Operation interface has been changed to allow input and output wrapper info to be held separately. Also Interface has some new operations. There are changes across the code base to take account of this interface change."
