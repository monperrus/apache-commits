   "[master] [89-fb] Make HBase compile without Snappy and pull TestCompressionTest from trunk", 
   "Author: mbautin", 
   "Summary:", 
   "In order to be able to compile HBase with our current HDFS release branch that does not have Snappy we need to lazily instantiate SnappyCodec via reflection. Also pulling in TestCompressionTest that tests all compression codecs.", 
   "Reviewing this internally because the HBase part of Snappy Hadoop integration requires to be manually ported to hbase-89-fb-apache.", 
   "Tagged as [master] but this is really an 89-fb-only change that is not applicable to hbase-apache-trunk.",

   "[master] gracefully shutdown log-syncer", 
   "Author: pkhemani", 
   "Summary:", 
   "HLog.close() was interrupting the log-syncer. That will lead to dfs sync being interrupted. And then log sync fails and jvm aborts. What was going to be a nice shutdown will now require log splitting.", 
   "HLog.close() will now drain all log edits before exiting.", 
   "Also fixed some error windows where the client would have received success without it's edits being successfully synced.", 
   "Test Plan: running unit tests.",
