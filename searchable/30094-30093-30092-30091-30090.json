   "\"Collecting data is only the first step toward wisdom. But sharing data is the first step toward community.\"", 
   "With this words, we like to share our knowledges of using OJB with JDO with the rest of the Cocoon community. We know this is just the first step in the integration of a O/R mapping tool with Cocoon. We choiced OJB because it is a project with a good looking future and bacause it is under the Apache Software Fundation umbrella. For these reason I guess we can work better together. I encourage all of you to review the half working samples and post any questions to the mail list about this interesting topic. Of course that help is wanted and welcomed :-D"
