   "Updated handling of annotation type-valued properties to resolve BEEHIVE-149.  The setter method now takes an instance of the annotation type, and the PropertyMap interface exposes a helper method (getPropertySet) that returns an annotation type proxy instance based upon map contents.  There is also a new constructor for BeanPropertyMap class that takes an annotation type instance, to fully enable get property -> create property map -> update property map -> set property use case."
