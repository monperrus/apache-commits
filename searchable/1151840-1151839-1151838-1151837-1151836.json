   "STANBOL-299: Added around 30 Integration Tests for the /find and /query interfaces of the Entityhub. In addition this includes some bug fixes and clarifications about how Query Responses have to look like. Especially the Query as returned by the result list now always corresponds to the query as executed and not the query as parsed to the entityhub.", 
   "Entityhub:", 
   "* The Query and FieldQuery interfaces now include the clone() method.", 
   "* The Implementations of the SiteManager now uses the Query as processed by the first ReferencedSite contributing a result as Query to be included in the ResultSet. NOTE that there might be the possibility that different Sites will execute different variants of an query.", 
   "* Corrected a bug in the getShorName(..) method of the NamespaceEnum", 
   "* Added support for Integration Tests to the entityhub.test module", 
   "* Added support for Testing /find and /query requests to the entityhub.test module", 
   "* Several small fixes and improvements to the FieldQuery <-> JSON converters", 
   "SolrYard:", 
   "* The SolrYard now uses xsd:int instead of xsd:integer for java.lang.Integer values. This does not have any influence on how data are stored it only changes the xsd:datatype reported for values stored as Integer.", 
   "* The SolrYard now reports the query as executed when creating QueryResultLists", 
   "Integration Tests", 
   "* Added Tests for the /find and /query interfaces of the Entityhub based on the dbpedia default dataset.", 
   "* Together with the dataset agnostic tests defined by the entityhub.test module there are now about 30 tests for the Query functionality of the Entityhub."
