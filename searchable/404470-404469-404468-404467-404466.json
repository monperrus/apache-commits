   "1. Completely redfining QueryResponse interface to avoid mapping by query", 
   "2. Changing the access stack to push the logic of converting query results to objects (or transferring those objects to a higher level Context) down to the lower level... This allows for nested channels and keeping DataRow logic at the DataDomain level where it belongs", 
   "3. Intercepting SingleObjectQuery and RelationshipQuery - thus fault resilution logic doesn't have to be hardcoded (and assume a certain stack structure)... it works just like a query.", 
   "4. OPP idea (as a single protocol for local and remote context chaining) didn't work out... So OPPChannel is now simply a DataChannel... OPP package will probably be renamed to \"remote\" or something."
