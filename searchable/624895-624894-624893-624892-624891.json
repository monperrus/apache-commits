   "WikiSession receives a series of new methods for stashing, retrieving and clearing UI messages. These are used primarily for auth-related messages but are generic. All of the JSP pages that previously stashed \"msg\" objects in the HttpSession now use these methods. A companion JSP tag <wiki:Messages> makes printing messages dead-simple."

   "Lots of cleanup to the top-level JSP pages: all of the permission-checking is now in a new WikiContext method called checkAccess(HttpServletResponse). The workflow now goes like this: if a non-authenticated user tries to access an unauthorized page, he or she is redirected to the login page. If already logged in, JSPWiki returns a standard 403 (forbidden) code. We will likely use a nicer error page in the future. LoginError.txt goes away; it is not needed any more."
