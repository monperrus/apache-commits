   "DERBY-2805: Fix FromVTI to not throw an ASSERT when sort elimination occurs.", 
   "In particular this patch does the following:", 
   "1 - Renames the \"markOrderingDependent()\" method and related variables to", 
   "reflect their use, which is to indicate that the optimizer has eliminated", 
   "a sort and thus that the underlying result sets *may* need to make", 
   "adjustments to compensate for the dropped sort.  At the moment the only", 
   "result set node which needs to make such an adjustment is", 
   "IndexRowToBaseRowNode.", 
   "2 - Updates comments where appropriate to more explicitly describe the", 
   "intended use of the \"adjustForSortElimination()\" method (which is", 
   "what \"markOrderingDependent()\" was renamed to).", 
   "3 - Adds a void implementation of \"adjustForSortElimination()\" to the", 
   "FromVTI class since that class doesn't need to make any adjustments.", 
   "This void method is what solves the failure reported in DERBY-2805.", 
   "4 - Adds appropriate test cases to a new fixture in the existing", 
   "lang/SysDiagVTIMappingTest JUnit test."
