   "Fix for hanging compliance test JCA_11017. In some cases Axis doesn't have the \"In\" context available at the point at which the outgoing message is sent. There is already code in TransportReferenceInterceptor to capture the \"In\" context when a response is received. The test was hanging as this was causing a crash so the client waited for ever for a response which never came."
