   "Consolidated the code that handles large text payloads. There is now a class ElementHelper with methods getTextAsStream and writeTextTo that can be used as alternatives to OMElement#getText() but that work with streams and guarantee constant memory usage and optimal efficiency. Note that the intention is to move these two methods to the corresponding class in Axiom, but this is not possible for the moment because of the release schedule."
