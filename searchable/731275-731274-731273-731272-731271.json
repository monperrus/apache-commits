   "o the release plugin manages to somehow get its own instance of a Settings so the SettingsAdapter which I use everywhere else gets used except in the release plugin so I have to jack back in the hardcoded RuntimeInfo until I figure out why. not a big deal, i'll list it in the compatibility notes. on another note if you start the release process using release:prepare and it fails, you make code changes, it will happily let you continue and not check the status again."

Somewhat limited by the JSON data at this stage - e.g. only author ID is passed in JSON, not the author name. For now, this is a reasonable proof-of-concept for further building on."
