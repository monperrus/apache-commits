   "Added src/python/scxml/cgf/target symlink, which was needed to provide access to built xsl resources from python modules.", 
   "Added topo-sort.xsl and custom dependency annotations to stylesheets. This should solve the problem of having to maintain a separate list of transformations for each compilation strategy, and each language. Now there is one canonical list for each compilation strategy, which gets constructed at compile-time."
