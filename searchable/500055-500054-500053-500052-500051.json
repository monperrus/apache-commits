   "Added QueryTemplateManager.java to aid construction of XML queries from form input by using XSL templates. A Junit test provides examples of use. This approach offers a convenient way of externalizing and changing how user input is turned into Lucene queries. Database applications often adopt similar practices by externalizing SQL in template files that can be easily changed/optimized by a DBA."
