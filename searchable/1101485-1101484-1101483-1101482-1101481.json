   "QPID-2759: Remove defunct jmxremote.access file user management rights manipulation abilities. 1) Removed remaining jmx access functionality. 2) Removed references to security/jmx/access from all existing configuration files. 3) Made ServerConfiguration#validateConfiguration reject config files that still contain the security/jmx/access element in order to promote good end-user understanding of configuration.",
