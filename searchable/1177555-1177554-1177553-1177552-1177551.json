   "Implemented a new Label Matching algorithm for Keyword Extraction:", 
   "Now the matching of Labels with the Text is fully based on Tokens. The Tokens following the current position in the Text are matched with the Tokens of the Label.", 
   "* Matching of Tokens do no longer use equals, but checks the common prefix/suffix. If the common part is > 0.75 than the Token is marked as matched.", 
   "* Matching does no longer enforce the correct order. However matches in the wrong oder still use exact matches and get a core lowerd to 0.75. This ensures that a text mentioning \"Berlusconi, Silvio\" is linked with the entity \"Silvio Berlusconi\". However it also means that a text mentioning the person \"Jack Black\" also matches \"Black Jack\". However Black Jack will only get a confidence of about 0.5.", 
   "* The score algorithm does no longer use the number of matched tokens. Now it uses the sum of the Token matches. So if a label matches 3 Tokens in the text however the 2nd tokens matches only 9 out of 10 chars and the 3rd token is in the wrong oder the sum of the token matches would be 1+0.9+0.75= 2,65 instead of 3."
