   "Fix for sdk-16496. Now transitions on targets that are not included in the 'to' state can be simple <Fade> effects, without requiring a Sequence that also has RemoveAction. We add back the target objects into the initial state for the duration of the effect, then remove it when finished. RemoveAction will still work if removal needs to be explicitly choreographed, but a simple Fade will at least do the job now.",

   "1) nonzero startDelay caused us to sometimes set the visible flag immediately, but not also send in the first alpha value (this only happens when the animation actually begins, after the startDelay duration). Fix is to set alpha=0 when first setting up animation, to ensure that if we set a fading-in object to be visible, it stays invisible until the fade actually starts.", 
   "2) composite effects do not restore the end state values until after the last child effect finishes, so we were sometimes restoring an alpha value without also making the item visible/invisible, thinking that the state-setting mechanism would handle it for us (which it does ... but not until other effects finish). Fix is to ensure that we set the object to be invisible if we are restoring alpha to 1, for fading-out effects.",

   "Fix for SDK-16608 and SDK-16445, plus Animation API cleanup.", 
   "I've removed the class and concept of IAnimationTarget, which was a duplicate, and more direct, way of listening to animation events. But to simplify the API, I've eliminated the target concept and, instead, require users of Animation to add themselves as listeners to the various AnimationEvent event types. This fixed SDK-16445 because final values were not being sent to targets, although they were being sent to event listeners (which Animate and other new effects benefit from now).", 
   "This also fixes SDK-16608, which was caused by assuming that any target of Fade must have the 'visible' property, which is not necessarily the case (such as for the Fill object).",

   "First checkin for the \"Arbitrary Type Interpolation\" feature. This feature has a rewritten Tween class (now named flex.effects.Animation). This class supports the old Tween capabilities, but adds functionality such as the ability to supply alternate interpolation objects (to allow animation of non-Number types), a new Easing API, and new 'repeat behavior' that will allow terser looping or reversing animations. The existing new effects were slightly changed to use the new Animation class (instead of Tween), and the superclass of the new effects, AnimateProperties (renamed 'Animate'), is now a subclass of Effect (not TweenEffect).", 
   "Added various new interpolation and easing classes, along with the new packages flex.effects.interpolation and flex.effects.easing. Also added new color-interpolation effect, 'Tint'.", 
   "Expect slight tweaks to the API during i7, but the bulk of the functionality and API changes are being checked in now.",
