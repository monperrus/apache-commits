   "Some changes to how Validators are used", 
   "- The processors do not now set default Validators, if the RequestData does not supply a Validator instance, then no validation is done", 
   "- Added a tag to WSSecurityEngineResult to indicate whether the token was validated or not", 
   "- Added support for the use-case of a Signature KeyInfo pointing to a BinarySecurityToken, which has been validated by a custom validator. Trust verification will pass for this case."
