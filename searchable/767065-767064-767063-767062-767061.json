   "CAMEL-1548: Fixed how error handler is wrapped in the route. Now every node is wrapped, also the children in a pipeline or aggregator. The JMX instrumentation code is however a bit flawed and will need an overhaul as well. The result is that redelivery with DLC now works as expected. The error handler notion of Around AOP is now truely correct."
