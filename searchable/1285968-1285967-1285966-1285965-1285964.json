This way if a user pauses the video and wants to start it up again at the same point, we can call play(null) on the underlying FLVPlayback videoPlayer.  However, anytime the souce changes, we want to null out sourceLastPlayed.  This was causing a bug when someone set the source to null and then reset it to it\u2019s previous value.", 
   "SDK-23034 (GUMBO_PRIORITY): This deals with some FLVPlayback quirks around sizing.  I had put in a fix so we weren\u2019t setting width/height on the underlying videoPlayer too many times, but apparently we need to make sure it always gets called once.  Hopefully when switching to Strobe we can cleanup this logic...I put a FIXME in to do this.", 
   "SDK-21947/ SDK-22533 - some video files don\u2019t always send out a metadata event.  I\u2019m not quite sure why this is, but in case this happens, we do a check in the ready handler to see whether we should call invalidateSize() to make sure it gets sized properly.",
