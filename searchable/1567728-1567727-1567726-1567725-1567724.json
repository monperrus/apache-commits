   "I found that the hashing algorithm that we use is the 32-bit MurmurHash version 2.", 
   "It seems there is a newer hash function in the same family, which according to the authors is about 25-30% faster. (https://code.google.com/p/smhasher/source/browse/wiki/MurmurHash3.wiki)",

   "I will write another benchmark to verify the collision resistance of MurmurHash3 when I get some bandwidth, and check how it improves/worsens the performance of ByteBloomFilter.",
