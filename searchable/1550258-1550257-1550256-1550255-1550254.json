   "Cancelled ship groups show incorrect quantities on the edit order items page.  I cancelled a ship group with a quantity of 2 for an order item but the quantity was still set to 2 when entering edit mode again.  Because its not set to 0 or blank, all cancelled ship groups must manually be set to one of those values in order for the quantity not to be added back after updating the order items.",
