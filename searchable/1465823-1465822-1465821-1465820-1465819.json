   "Added support for CPU hard limits via CFS Bandwidth Control.", 
   "CFS is unique relative to existing Mesos cgroups support in that it", 
   "is a \"subfeature\" of an already supported cgroups subsystem, cpu.", 
   "Also, there are two \"tunables\" for configuring CFS bandwidth", 
   "limiting.", 
   "There are 4 approaches one could take:", 
   "1) Use the CFS bandwidth limiting if the feature is present.", 
   "2) Expose as separate flag, eg \"cpu,cfs,memory,freezer\".", 
   "3) Add feature flag support to subsystems via an additional delimiter,", 
   "e.g., \"cpu+cfs,memory,freezer\".", 
   "4) Add an additional control flag via some other means.", 
   "Option 2's downside breaks the 1:1 mapping between cgroups subsystems", 
   "and a cgroups resource flag.", 
   "Option 3's downside is it greatly increases complexity of parsing", 
   "cgroups subsystem flags.", 
   "This diff takes option 1.",
