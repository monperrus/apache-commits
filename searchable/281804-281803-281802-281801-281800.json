   "Added the (old, experimental) ajp23 worker.", 
   "Ajp23 was used to test bi-directional communication between apache", 
   "and tomcat - the main difference from ajp12 is that the response is", 
   "sent as a sequence of blocks ( prefixed by length ) as oposed to a stream", 
   "terminated by socket close.", 
   "That allows the reuse of the connection and bi-directional communication.", 
   "Apache will start by sending a MsgBuff containing the request and wait for", 
   "a MsgBuff from tomcat. As soon as it receives one it will start processing it", 
   "and send back a response ( if needed ), and so on.", 
   "It seems jk_ framework is very easy to work with, but I still have to figure", 
   "how to keep the session open ( in a multithreaded environment ) - probably", 
   "we need a per/thread cache or something.",
