   "Some work on Start.java - Try to have better control over loading/starting/unloading loaders. The shutdown hook is set before the loaders are loaded, so they can be unloaded if the OFBiz process terminates during loading. Also, thread synchronization was added so that loaders can't be loaded and unloaded simultaneously.", 
   "This commit might cause some loaders to throw exceptions during premature shutdown - that's because some loaders are not designed to be unloaded asynchronously."
