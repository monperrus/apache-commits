   "DERBY-4107: Clarify description of DATE function with integer argument.", 
   "This change clarifies the description of the DATE function when it is", 
   "given an integer argument. The previous text stated that the DATE function", 
   "took the argument as the number of days since the year 0001, but this is", 
   "incorrect; the function uses 1970 as the reference year and computes the", 
   "number of days since then.", 
   "The change also adds an example of the result of DATE(789)."
