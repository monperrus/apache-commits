   "When destinations are removed via JMX or by auto remove of inactive destinations an existing producer registration can be left with a reference to a resource that no longer exists but appears valid.  The destination should be marked as disposed so that a producer send can check to see if it should discard its current reference to the destination and either recreate it or update its cache to point to the currect destination resource."
