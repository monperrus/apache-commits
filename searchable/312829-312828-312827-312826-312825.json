   "Resolving: MNG-449, MNG-152, MNG-1090, MNG-1089, MNG-1122", 
   "o Removed -cpl and related command line switches for controlling use of LATEST metadata for resolving plugin versions", 
   "o Made LATEST the only metadata used to resolve plugin versions, since this is also available when releases are performed", 
   "o Added various error diagnostics for project build exceptions", 
   "o Enhanced artifact not found error diagnostics", 
   "o Removed maven-project and added maven-artifact to maven-surefire-plugin's pom", 
   "o Removed the stanza that added pluginArtifacts to the test-booter's classpath...they are already covered by the classpathElements", 
   "o Fixed ITs in connection to the removal of -cpl", 
   "o Changed the plugin manager to detect whether a plugin's artifact file has changed since the plugin container was created...if so, reload it.", 
   "o Took the projecthelp plugin out of the build until I can diagnose the problems with its build (probably tomorrow)."
