   "1) Introduced prepared statement caching.   We need lots of testing for this one.  It's easy to remove if it doesn't work out, but DON'T do an SVN revert from this version.  Unfortunately I ended up doing some cosmetic changes too, which will make a reversion after a succeeding commit a bit messy.  I ran both the iBATIS unit tests, as well as JPetStore and external tests against SQL Server."
