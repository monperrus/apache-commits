   "Compilation of the Solr-core module under the Maven build has been broken since SOLR-2378 was committed on April 14th (the Google Guava dependency was declared with <scope>test</scope>, but SOLR-2378 uses it in non-test classes).  The fix: remove the test scope declaration on the dependency, so that it is also a non-test dependency."

The nightly Maven build scripts, both of which include this script, failed to identify the compilation failure because the Ant build output was not being cleared before starting the Maven build.  Adding 'clean' to the 'mvn install' invocation will force Maven to do its own compilation."
