   "Changed some test cases to use the simpler form of SCADomain.newInstance(). Minor cleanup of SCADomain and DefaultSCADomain. Fixed reflection based construction of SCADomain to use the correct set of parameters. Added logic to use META-INF/sca-deployables as another hint to determine the location of an SCA contribution if the other hints fail."
