   "- OntoNet meta graph also keeps track of collector-ontology relations (TODO still need to use it for rebuilding ontology networks) (STANBOL-518, STANBOL-571)", 
   "- I am undoing part of the work done for STANBOL-524 and STANBOL-572. OWL versionIRI is still used, but only when exporting the ontologies to OWL. Internally, we should use a different ownership mechanism (modifying the versionIRI in the graph can cause a new naming for the meta graph)."
