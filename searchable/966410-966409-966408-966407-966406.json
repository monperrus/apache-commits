   "Added VIM_SSH.pm which can manage a host using calls to vim-cmd via SSH.", 
   "VMware.pm:", 
   "-Removed \"use\" calls to the API/SDK modules at the beginning of the file. These modules are now imported dynamically when needed.", 
   "-Added default scsi-virtualDev values to %VM_OS_CONFIGURATION hash. These are used if the disk adapter type cannot be determined by querying the virtual disk.", 
   "-Added support for the new VIM_SSH.pm module. Added check to see if SSH is available if the vSphere SDK cannot be used.", 
   "-Commented out support for the VIX_API.pm module since VIM_SSH.pm can do everything it can do.", 
   "-Added exception check in get_vmhost_datastructure because the DataStructure constructor may return a true value even if it fails.", 
   "-Added support to use the API/SDK's copy_virtual_disk", 
   "-Added mount_repository_datastore subroutine.  This is not called yet.  It will eventually allow the host to mount an NFS datastore pointing to the image repository.", 
   "vSphere_SDK.pm:", 
   "-Changed default disk type to thin in copy_virtual_disk. Sparse disks don't seem to work with ESXi 4.", 
   "-Changed get_vmware_product_name to return the full product name so that its output matches running vmware -v from the console.", 
   "-Added get_network_names subroutine.  This isn't called yet but will allow the VM's network adapters to be dynamically created in the future rather than having to define virtual switches in the database.", 
   "Made minor fixes to VIX_API.pm."
