   "[MNG-2054] make it0096 test the problem properly by going to enough depth. Rollback the \"fix\" for MNG-2130 as it didn't appear to be correct - it caused it0096, and it0099 passes anyway. I suspect there were other circumstances in the codebase causing 99 to fail at the time. You should not use a cached project for inheritence - it will accumulate inherited elements as was the case with MNG-2054."
