   "When you set the 'text' property of RichText to a String that has line-ending sequences such as LF or CR+LF, a TextFlow with multiple paragraph is now produced as the 'content'. The splitting is done using TLF's importer for PLAIN_TEXT_FORMAT if the 'text' is found to contain \\r or \\n.", 
   "Previously, all of the multi-line text got stuffed into one span in one paragraph. But when you have a large paragraph (i.e., a large TextBlock), FTE is slow to break the first TextLine because it analyzes all of the text first. And if the text has lots of CR+LF line endings, the current player is horribly slow because of excessive mem-copying as the two characters get replaced by one glyph.", 
   "Furthermore, as Peter found, there is precedent for doing this: when you set the 'text' of TextField and get the 'htmlText', it splits the text into paragraphs.", 
   "With this change, you can display a large line-oriented file like the 12000-line source for UIComponent (on Windows, which uses CR+LF) in a few seconds instead of many minutes.",
