   "Splitted LocalDelivery in 2 mailets. Mantained a wrapper LocalDelivery that works like before. (#4 and part of #5 in JAMES-414)", 
   "I named the storing mailet \"ToMultiRepository\" because I want to make it more generic later.", 
   "The only difference between the refactored LocalDelivery and the original is in the Delivered-To header: the old mailet added a Delivered-To with the address entering the mailet while the new one put in the Delivered-To the actual mailbox (e.g: After aliasing).", 
   "More documentation on new configurations will come later too."
