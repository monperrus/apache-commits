   "AXISCPP-479 HandlerTest4 fails on AIX. This is not a fix to this JIRA. Instead this test fails intermittently on AIX. I cannot reproduce this problem myself, although it regularly fails during the overnight build. It fails in ~DeserializerPool immediately after it has deleted the last (and only) IWrapperSoapDeSerializer. It is not clear to me why this is happening. Consequently I am adding in extra trace into DeserializerPool and making the code more defensive. Also I have removed some unnecessary casts in the testcase. I hope that if the test continues to fail, I will be able to diagnose the problem from the extra trace."
