   "Changing the lifecycle of the layout object in GroupBase.  Before, we\u2019d always instantiate one in GroupBase\u2019s constructor.  Now, we wait until createChildren() time to instantiate the default.  This means if people set the layout object, we won\u2019t be creating this extra BasicLayout we don\u2019t need.  There was an assumption in GroupBase around some of the proxied properties that the layout object was always going to be present.  These are cleaned up for when the layout object doesn\u2019t always exist.  Also, now when the layout object is swapped at runtime, the verticalScrollPosition and horizontalScrollPosition don\u2019t get pushed into the new layout object, as they may not translate correctly.  We discussed the possibility of sending in a \u201cfirst item in view\u201d for when the layout object is swapped, but for now, we don\u2019t do anything like that.",
