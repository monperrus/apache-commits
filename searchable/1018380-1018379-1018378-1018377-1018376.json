   "Broken out nos-bootstrap from nos-system; simplifying/rationalizing the pom.xml dependencies; renamed ReflectorEnhancement/ReflectorPeer to ReflectorDecorator; updated copyright dates; fixed prob with ImageServlet in html viewer (I think) introduced by upgrading to newer version of Jetty; renamed ImageServlet to ResourceServlet + now picks up .css resources; minor reworking of NakedObjectSystem/InstallerLookup with latter now passed into former (rather than being instantiated by it) ... this possibly gives us more control on where we read framework.properties from."
