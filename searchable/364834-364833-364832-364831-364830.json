   "add new enhanced store/delete methods in PBI which allow only to perform the specified object without take care of referenced objects. Think in OJB 1.x we should introduce a better separation of methods supporting store/delete operations based on the auto-xxx settings and methods only handle a single object, this allows to use the auto-xxx settings in top-level api independent from the PB-api."
