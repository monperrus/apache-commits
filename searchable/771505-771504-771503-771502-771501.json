It also changes the method signatures for getRefersTo and getReferredBy to return lists of WikiPath. Several plugins were changed to accommodate this."

   "To prevent wiki paths that have space prefixes from being interpreted as inter-wiki links,  JSPWikiMarkupParser prioritizes these first. This means that that wiki space names can't be the same as those for an interwiki prefixes. (Which is ok: when you think about it, an outside wiki is really just a space managed by someone else.) This fix was needed prevent various unit tests from bombing."

WikiEngine also gains a method getSpaces(), which today only returns the default space. In the future this will be configurable."
