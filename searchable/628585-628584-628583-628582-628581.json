   "DERBY-3424 (partial) Improve JMXManagementService to spearate registering of mbeans with Derby's management service from registering with the JMX service. This allows the ManagementMBEan to correctly implement the stop and start management service to unregister (from the platform mbean server) Derby's MBean when the stopManagement() is called and then re-register them when startManagement() is called."
