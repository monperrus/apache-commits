   "Modified the grammar for the declarative validation of a custom rule. The ValidateCustomGrammar no longer requires either \"message\" or \"messageKey\" attributes in the @ValidateCustomRule annotation. The msg attribute of the custom rule <validator> element (in validation-rules.xml) is the default message key to use when this validator fails. The \"message\" and \"messageKey\" attributes can be used to override the msg.",
