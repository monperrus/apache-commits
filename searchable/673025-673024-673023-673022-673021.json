   "Changed FindGeneric to not do 2 queries, ie instead of doing a find count and then a find, now just does the find and gets the count using the new EntityListIterator method to seek to the end and get the index; that should be faster, though not totally sure; also changed FindGeneric and ViewGeneric from bsh to groovy and did some cleanups/fixes"
