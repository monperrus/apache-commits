   "TUSCANY-3653 - Add a slot to store the contribution that was used to resolve the class that the class reference points to. This is used when WSDL files, that the Class may point to via JAXWS @WebService or @WebServiceProvider annotations need to be resolved within the same contribution that holds the Java class. What we maybe could do is have a better model of Java class, and a related processor, that is able to look for annotations and do the resolution at the time the Java class is resolved."
