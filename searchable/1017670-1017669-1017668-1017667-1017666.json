   "Introduced a new ValueSemanticsProvider capability, modelled after (and which wraps) Parser and EncoderDecoder.  This removes the duplication we had in the previous design regarding immutable/equalByContent flags being specified in two places.  It also means that we don't need to provide the class name twice (once as a Parser, once as an EncoderDecoder).  Very peachy!"
