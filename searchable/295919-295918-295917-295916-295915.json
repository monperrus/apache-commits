   "A small change in the mechanism used to register workers.", 
   "Jk is 'object oriented', but so far the only 'interface' with multiple implementations", 
   "are 'jk_worker'. ( well, also the server adapter - but at runtime you have a single", 
   "one, depending on what server you use ).", 
   "In order to 'play' with different channels and optimizations _without_ affecting the", 
   "stability of jk we need to enhance the config mechanism to support other object types.", 
   "( for example different types of channel ).", 
   "This is also a first step in using APR - again, the current code will remain as", 
   "the 'stable' implementation ( after some minimal refactoring ), while objects using", 
   "APR can be configured-in at runtime ( on Apache2.0 or if apr is available ).", 
   "Before this, we had an array of workers that was used to create the worker_list.", 
   "This changes add a 'registerFactory' method that could be used for any kind of", 
   "object  ( right now we don't check for type, the factory method will be able to do", 
   "this ). This is similar with how hooks are registered in 2.0 ( using explicit method", 
   "calls )", 
   "An additional benefit is that we can split jk in multiple modules - the 'main' module", 
   "will contain the common code, and additional modules could plug in alternative", 
   "workers, channels, loggers, etc.", 
   "The jk_env will grow to provide a simpler access to loggers, pools, etc.", 
   "The code change is minimal - and everything seems to work fine, but it would be nice if", 
   "someone can verify."
