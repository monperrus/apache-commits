   "Add mouseWheelChanging event to VScrollBar, HScrollBar and Scroller.  The event is dispatched before the mouseWheel event modifies the scroll position.  The event can be canceled to prevent the mouseWheel handler's default behavior or the event's delta can be modified and that value will be used by the mouseWheel handler when calculating the new scroll position.  In RichEditableText, when pasting, add null check before accessing the TextScrap.  There is a bug in one or more version of the player such that this can be null at times.",
