   "Added a very basic file download function for responding to a GET request for an exported widget instance (\"flatpack\"). This gets around various configuration issues associated with \"default servlets\" on different servlet containers (e.g. Jetty vs Tomcat) - see WOOKIE-231 and WOOKIE-182. Limitations in terms of security have also been noted in the code comments, and associated functional tests were also updated. Note that requests for flatpacks are now targeted at GET /flatpack/{id} and not /exports/{id}, but that exported files are still physically located in /exports - however the /exports folder itself is not published."
