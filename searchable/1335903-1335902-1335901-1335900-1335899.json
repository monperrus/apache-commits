   "Clean up the mess I made yesterday with PLAYERGLOBAL/PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME.  It turns out that playerglobal.swc and airglobal.swc are magic strings in the compiler and swfs don't run if the swcs don't have these names. Since the playerglobal swc must be named playerglobal.swc we're back to PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME which should point to the directory which contains playerglobal.swc.  Also fix build_framework.xml so it work with these changes."
