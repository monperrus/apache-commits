   "TUSCANY-2501 reference should either be all annotated or all not annotated. Here change the vtests to test these cases separately. Currently mixing annotated and unannotated fields as references causes any unannotated reference to be overlooked. Change the reference not found warning to an error to catch cases where they are mixed by accident. Changes to other tests to take account of this. Also change implementation.widget to pick up the string name of the reference in javascript rather than the name of the variable to which the reference is assigned."
