   "Completely reimplemented the PDFTextPainter. All SVG text (including flow text, but excluding special cases with filters) is now painted in PDF text primitives.", 
   "The whole thing compiles against and runs with Batik 1.6 but was developed against Batik Trunk (1.7). The TextBridge for SVG 1.2 text is omitted because we're still on Batik 1.6 and FOP wouldn't compile with it. The full feature set is only available with Batik 1.7, of course. With Batik 1.6, font selection may not work as expected."
