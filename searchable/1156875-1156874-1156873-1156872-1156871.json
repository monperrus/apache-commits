   "- Fixed log messages. SLF4J doesn't do the right thing with log(string, object, throwable). - Fixed a bug (in a really gross way) where we didn't close a sink if a source failed to open. - Improved ChannelDriver unit tests to ensure the number of events from a source match those successfully delivered to the sink. - Added tests for both flakey next and append methods in the source and sink respectively."
