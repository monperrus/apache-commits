   "multicast (and broadcast (and brute force poll)) discovery for web services, dynamically bound to Axis; also works as standalone. Currently uses Castor; I should move to a pure dom or sax binding.", 
   "The protocol itself is an XML version of Service Location Protocol; at this stage we could actually plug in a new wire format and the discovery service would *really* be SLP, though we dont scope ourselves properly (its polite to get scope from DHCP servers), and I deliberately throttle back the TTL from 255 to something lower. We need more experimentation there.", 
   "Documentation is docbook format, XSLTs to HTML, FOPs to PDF. We need more docs, and a better way of integrating with Axis than hacking a new service into axis's web.xml."
