   "QPID-2274 : Addressed initial issues with Async compressing deleting log files", 
   "QPID-2275: Update so that CountDirection +ve,-ve work correctly in conjunction with exiting log files and MaxSizeRollBackups", 
   "Adding .n to the end of the name and calculating the .n value based on existing log files.", 
   "QPID-2275 : Update to address CountDirection 0 increments when MaxFileSize kicks in before DatePattern.", 
   "Now it is possible to specify a DatePattern with small units (seconds/minutes) and not lose log file date when the MaxFileSize causes the file to roll over", 
   "QPID-2155 : Update addressing issues with compression and maintaining backup counts.", 
   "Because a compressed file is renamed the .n value is not recognised so this update makes it check for the COMPRESSION_EXTENSION (.gz)", 
   "QPID-2155 : Added NPE checks for path errors, updated to check the backup location for existing backup files to initialise the .n count", 
   "QPID-2155 : Updated log4j file with more sensible default values for the QpidRollingFileAppender appender.", 
   "Also added more local documentation explaining the more obscure params"
