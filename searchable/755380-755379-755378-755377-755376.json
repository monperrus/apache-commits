   "Added auto option for link-type that will figure out if a hidden-form is needed or not; the hidden-form option will only work for intra-app links that refer to a request that calls an event; changed the ProductForms hyperlink defs to not specify a link-type any more and just use the auto; note that for targets with parameters inline in the URL and not in the parameter sub-element the parameters will still be in the form action and not in hidden fields, so those need to be changed for this to be effective"
