   "[UIMA-1119] improve error message for xmi deserialization.  Applied Burn's patch, but changed the new message to indicate it is coming from xmi deserialization.  Didn't change the other messages, which still say XCAS, (which is wrong if they are issued by the xmi deserializer), in case other (test?) code might depend on these messages."
