   "Updated new.pm to call OS.pm::update_public_ip_address() rather than getdynamicaddress.  Rearranged if/else structure in process() to remove duplicate calls to update_currentimage.  Removed call to update_public_ip_address() in Windows.pm::post_load() because it is now called by new.pm.",

   "Changed initial time to wait from 120 seconds to 15 seconds in Windows.pm after a computer is powered on before checking for SSH to respond. VM images configured to not use Sysprep may respond much quicker than 120 seconds."
