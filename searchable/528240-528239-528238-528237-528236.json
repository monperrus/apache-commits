   "Removed those pesky sessions directory when the unittests run that were created in the project root folder. Now the context work dir is created inside the target folder (only for unittests). This fix assumes you run using maven or in an eclipse project generated by maven (and if not, then the only thing different is that you'll now get a target/sessions folder instead of a sessions/ folder)."
