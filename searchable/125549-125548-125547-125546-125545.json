   "Significant rework of the Beehive build.", 
   "The BUILDING.txt file has the best description of how to setup a new build environment.", 
   "Major changes:", 
   "- remove Ant from the build", 
   "- remove Tomcat from the build", 
   "- note, this is still required as it's the default Servlet container, but Beehive doesn't install this", 
   "- remove the BEEHIVE_HOME environment variables from the SVN and distribution builds", 
   "- remove all *.cmd / *.sh scripts for initializing an environment from the SVN and distribution builds", 
   "- remove the beehive.properties file and change to the Ant <import> model that Bob proposed.  Paths and filesets are now defined at the top-level and shared among all sub-projects.", 
   "- move Ant used for testing from test/ant to /ant.  This puts the webapp build files in the same place as the distribution and makes it easier to target an application against either SVN or a distribution.", 
   "- no longer force copying of junit.jar to $ANT_HOME/lib", 
   "- this is now an install step", 
   "- no longer force copying tomcat-users.xml to $CATALINA_HOME/conf", 
   "- this is now an install step", 
   "- remove isJDKOver5 checks from nested builds.  this is a requirement for Beehive.", 
   "- implement Java / Ant version checking in /beehive-imports.xml", 
   "- move the definition of an XMLBean schema task from sub-projects to beehive-imports.xml", 
   "- start isolating WS / app container dependencies in:", 
   "ant/axis-imports.xml", 
   "ant/tomcat-imports.xml", 
   "These files expose <target>s that are referenced in Ant macros defined in beehive-imports.xml.  To plug-in a new server, implement one of these files and change the correct \"webservice.runtime\" or \"servlet.runtime\" property in beehive-imports.xml", 
   "- switch NetUI coreWeb tests off of using explicitly registered Struts TLDs to using the ones in struts.jar", 
   "- move the targets for building a distribution into distribution.xml", 
   "- update BUILDING.txt", 
   "What's broken / undone:", 
   "- running the controls performance tests", 
   "- re-wiring the builds for all of the code in samples/.  The Ant build file shipped in the distribution need work before", 
   "the next ship date, and these can be fixed as the distribution builds shake out.", 
   "- running the JSF tests for NetUI", 
   "- removing Axis from the samples.  Seems that this should be like Tomcat -- something that the user installs and Beehive references.", 
   "I'm sure that there are other things that aren't completed or wired up, but hopefully with this checked in, others can pitch-in and help make all of this better.", 
   "If you've got an existing Beehive build environment, you'll need to make the following changes:", 
   "1) install Tomcat 5.0.x and set CATALINA_HOME in your shell", 
   "2) install Ant 1.6.2 and set ANT_HOME in your shell", 
   "3) copy trunk/external/junit/junit.jar to $ANT_HOME/lib",

   "<user username=\"manager\" password=\"manager\" roles=\"manager\"/>",
