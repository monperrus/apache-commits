   "LUCENE-3200: MMapDirectory now uses chunk sizes that are powers of 2. When setting the chunk size, it is rounded down to the next possible value. The new default value for 64 bit platforms is 2^30 (1 GiB), for 32 bit platforms it stays unchanged at 2^28 (256 MiB). Internally, MMapDirectory now only uses one dedicated final IndexInput implementation supporting multiple chunks, which makes Hotspot's life easier"
