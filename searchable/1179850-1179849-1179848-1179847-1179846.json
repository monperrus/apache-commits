   "Improved Windows code which retrieves services configured to run as a particular user. It was very slow. The service information is now exported from the registry into a text file and parsed. This is faster than running 'reg.exe query' since the services section is very large.  Moved get_file_contents from Linux.pm to OS.pm since it can also be used by the Windows code."
