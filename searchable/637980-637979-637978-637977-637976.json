Reverted the change in AMQMinaProtocolSession.java that is causing the issue but we need to correctly fix this issue in the client as the client is not AMQP spec compliant, even with the STRICT_AMQP flag. Updated SelectorTest.java with an additional test so we don't have the functionality reversion later."
