   "bring mod_rewrite up to 2.3.9:", 
   "Patchlevel 8 (961211):", 
   "o Incorporated the \"const\" changes of the Apache Group to 2.3.5", 
   "into this release. But in a way to be backward compatible to Apache", 
   "1.1.1.", 
   "o Made gmtoff usage again workable in both 1.1.1 and 1.2", 
   "because the function was changed in Apache 1.2.", 
   "o Incorporated a patch to make mod_rewrite useable under Apache SSL,", 
   "i.e. with https:// URLs..", 
   "[Thanks to Michael Smith <mjs@cursci.co.uk>]", 
   "o Added a check whether the proxy module is", 
   "compiled in or not. If not then [P] is forbidden.  This is not 100%", 
   "safe, because it can still be turned off (ProxyRequests off) and then", 
   "[P] can lead to a core dump. But there is no trivial way to check if", 
   "the ProxyRequest is turned on or off. But the current variant of the", 
   "check is useful for people who use [P] but have no proxy module", 
   "even compiled in.", 
   "o Added some warning to the documentation that ProxyRequests must be", 
   "\"on\" when the [P] flag gets used.", 
   "[Thanks to Philip Peake <philip@vogon.rain.com> for hint]", 
   "o Fixed the installation description in the docs.", 
   "o Fixed a recently removed \"#\" char in mod_rewrite.h", 
   "Patchlevel 9:", 
   "The recently introduced proxy check code was syntactically correct but not", 
   "semantically. Hmmm.. lead to a core dump under 1.2b2. Thanks to Mark J. Cox", 
   "<mark@ukweb.com> for the hint."
