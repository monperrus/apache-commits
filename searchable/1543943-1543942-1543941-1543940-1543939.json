   "If an IO error occurs while sending (or receiving) a WebSocket message pretty much the only thing that can be done is to close the connection - hopefully in a graceful manner. Therefore, leave the state machine in the \"message in progress\" state if an error occurs as this will prevent further attempts to send non-control messages. The close message is a control message so it will not be blocked. Note that the close message may not reach the other end of the connection."
