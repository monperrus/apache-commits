   "Now the dummyForm system work a bit different. When a component needs to render a dummyForm, an object with the dummyForm params is instantiated and put in the request map. The AddResource class, called from the extensions filter, will render the dummyForm before the end of the body tag getting the information from the request. No more subclasses of HtmlResponseWriter needed to deal with the dummyForm. Also this should fix an issue where tobago couldn't work, due to a class cast to HtmlResponseWriterImpl (and tobago uses another implementation of the HtmlResponseWriter)"
