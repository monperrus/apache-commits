   "Removed the code that attempts to determine the charset encoding and/or byte order using the algorithm described in the \"Autodetection of Character Encodings\" appendix of the XML spec. It is the role of the XML parser to do that. The code was necessary in earlier Axis2 versions because the message builders used a Reader instead of an InputStream (see AXIS2-2508). Since they now pass the InputStream directly to the parser, the getCharSetEncoding thing is no longer required."
