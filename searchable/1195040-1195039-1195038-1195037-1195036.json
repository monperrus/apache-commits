   "each time s/he produces an inventory item in manufacturing, s/he can specify the lot id ;", 
   "s/he can choose the lot s/he wants when s/he makes a sale order or a manufacturing process ;", 
   "there is a new screen which allows the user to realize the tracking of lots.", 
   "jleroux: apart some formatting and typos, I used only availableToPromiseTotal (instead of also quantityOnHandTotal) when checking the stock of a lot while editing a Picklist Item.", 
   "Note: I only reviewed the code, but did not find enough time to test. As the code was straightforward I decided to add it"
