   "Update tests for the fix to BEEHIVE-1115. Note that the action with a forward of Jpf.NavigateTo.currentPage without setting any actionOutputs on the forward should have the actionOutputs from the saved current page info, in this case it was via the begin action and the forward to page1.faces. Before the fix to BEEHIVE-1115, the page processes was re-saving the previous page info because the saved attribute was not set on the request and the uri for the corresponding jsp was different from the path of the forward to the *.faces. If the action doesn't set/reset the actionOutputs, then the return to current page should have the original actionOutputs from the saved page info.",
