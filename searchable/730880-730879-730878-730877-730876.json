   "TCPMon: Refactored the code responsible for request/response processing (\"Host\" header rewriting, plain HTTP <-> proxy HTTP switching, XML formatting, etc.) to make it more readable, manageable and reusable. The new code is organized around a stream/pipeline/filter metaphor. The complexity of stream processing (buffering, rewriting, lookahead, etc.) is hidden in the new Pipeline class and a set of distinct filters replace the processing code contained in AbstractConnection and AbstractSocketRR.", 
   "The modifications should also solve WSCOMMONS-80, WSCOMMONS-380 and WSCOMMONS-425."
