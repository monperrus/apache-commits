   "This patch contains multiple changes, mostly renames, outlined below:", 
   "1.Rename properties in FxComponent: skinObject -> skin, skinZZ -> skinClass.", 
   "2.Rename property in Skin: data -> fxComponent (this also means Skin doesn\u2019t implement IDataRenderer anymore)", 
   "3.Renames in DataGroup: Mostly around \"skin\" to \"renderer\" to get terminology correct", 
   "4.Random other cleanups: For instance changing typing of \"*\" to \"Object\" in ItemsComponent and DataGroup or removing some un-used imports in Group and GroupBase.", 
   "5.Lots of cleanup in flex4tests to deal with renaming of classes and renaming of properties", 
   "6.Gumbo-manifest.mxml  - typo...some files listed as mx.componentss.* instead of mx.components.*.  This file is going away as all components are moved into the 2009 namespace, but we'll fix this for now.", 
   "7.Defaults.css \u2013 FxDataComponent should be FxDataContainer.", 
   "8.SystemManger fix: this was in the previous SystemManager but got overwritten by a bad merge.  Jim\u2019s aware of the issue, and I\u2019m checking in the fix for it.",

   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",
