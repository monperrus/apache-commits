   "Enhancement: the JSPWiki security policy now supports permission grants to wiki group principals (GroupPrincipal). In addition, a new Permission class, auth.permissions.AllPermission, grants administrative rights to specific wikis (or all, with the wildcard). The combination of these two enhancements means that wiki groups can now possess administrative rights. See the security policy for a sample grant block."
