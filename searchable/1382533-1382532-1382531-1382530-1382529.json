   "RAVE-698: replace forked spring RequestMappingHandlerAdapter with a separate adapter around our nested/hmvc HandlerAdapter.", 
   "This AdapterAdapter delegates to a handleNested method instead of the final handleInternal method which we previously had to fork to to be able to override.", 
   "If or when the final handleInternal method in the spring RequestMappingHandlerAdapter is relaxed so we can extend and wrap it, this temporary AdapterAdapter solution no longer will be needed."
