   "Move startup code into CassandraDaemon.  Drop stdout and stderr.  Add hooks for jsvc, which allows more thorough daemonization (such as dropping priviledges and setting process name).  New startup script bin/casssandra provides out-of-the-box background mode without hacks like screen or nohup; -f flag restores old foreground mode.  Also -p <filename> to log pid.  Patch by Eric Evans for #20"
