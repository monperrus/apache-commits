   "If Derby chooses to do a join between two FromTables and the right table is a", 
   "chain of UNIONs, then the optimizer may choose to push the join predicate (if", 
   "provided) down into the UNION and to both children of every UNION in the chain.", 
   "But if the predicate cannot be pushed to the children of any of the UNIONs", 
   "(except the top-level one) the predicate can end up being ignored altogether", 
   "with respect to that UNION's children. The result is that query execution can", 
   "return rows that do not satisfy the predicate.",
