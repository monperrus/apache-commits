Incomingoopen content is now deserialized correctly (to do this without running into JIRA TUSCANY-747 we pass the SOAP body to the Axiom Helper instead of the Body part). Outgoing open content is represented as OpenDataObjects and we pass the correct SOAP body part element name to the Axiom Helper to get it serialized under the correct element name."
