   "Merged https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/xmlgraphics/fop/branches/Temp_PDF_in_PDF (563130:HEAD) into Trunk.", 
   "Adds generic structures in PDF so it is possible to embed external PDF documents, for example to support PDF files in fo:external-graphic for PDF output. See also: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-fop-dev/200708.mbox/%3c20070806165027.5C59.DEV@jeremias-maerki.ch%3e", 
   "I tried to keep the changes on the API of the PDF library minimal but there could still be some incompatibilities for anyone who uses it separately.", 
   "This also adds support for dynamically registering an image handler. That's just a temporary solution until the image package redesign is done. But it works."
