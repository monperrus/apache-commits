   "As discussed in the dev list a few months ago, this commits removes Seleniumxml from the trunk.", 
   "Seleniumxml was a subcomponent of the framework/testtools intended to facilitate the usage of Selenium tests in OFBiz.", 
   "However it was never upgraded to the new version of Selenium and it has not been widely adopted by the community; the OFBiz community agreed to remove components/tools like this from the core distribution if they are optional/very specific or not well maintained or if there is (as in the case of Selenium) a valid external alternative to perform the same actions."
