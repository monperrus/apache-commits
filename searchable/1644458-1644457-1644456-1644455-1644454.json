   "VCL-780 - combine new reservation and current reservations pages",

   "VCL-308 - Computer load log does not account for images that have to be transferred to another management node", 
   "requests.php:", 
   "-modified viewRequests: added 'userconnected' to each array in $requests for tracking if the user has actually connected to the reservation (previously, the request state did not go into 'inuse' until this happened, but that has changed); expanded height of detailed load status pane from 280px to 300px to allow for additional line for transferring image from another managementnode; changed how connectDlgContent gets cleared when connectDlg is closed to use dijit function instead of just setting innerHTML to ''", 
   "-modified getViewRequestHTMLitem: changed how we determine if timeoutvalue should be end of reservation to check if user has connected instead of checking for reservation being in 'inuse' state", 
   "-modified detailStatusHTML: added check for reservation being timedout and send appripriate message if so", 
   "-modified AJconnectRequest: add connecttimeout entry to computerloadlog when Connect button is clicked if remoteIP has not been set yet, this allows us to key off of it to know when to reload the reservations page data if the user never connects; added timeoutvalue class to timeoutvalue hidden input so it will be picked up by JS function that checks for when to reload reservation page data", 
   "-modified getReservationNextTimeout and getReservationConnectTimeout: added affiliation specific timeout to query", 
   "-added checkUserConnect", 
   "requests.js: modified checkConnectTimeout: removed TODO comments before it; added parseInt around getting timeoutvalue's value"
