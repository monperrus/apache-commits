   "* Backport Windows installer improvements from Tomcat 7.0.5.", 
   "- Use *modern* types of nsis install/uninstall icons (r999976, mturk)", 
   "- Create service-install.log file during installation with params that were used to invoke commons daemon. (r1003840, mturk; r1035083,r1035088 kkolinko)", 
   "- Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=50140 Don't ignore a user specified install directory on 64-bit platforms.", 
   "- Allow 32-bit or 64-bit JVMs to be selected when installing on a 64-bit platform. (r1027504, markt; r1033856,r1033882 kkolinko)", 
   "- Reimplemented the Windows installer GUI using nsDialogs and MUI2 libraries, instead of deprecated InstallOptions. The *.ini files are no more used. All is specified in the nsi script. (r1034911, kkolinko)", 
   "- Use new admin-gui and manager-gui roles for the user (r982151, mturk)", 
   "- Add a field to display/edit the roles for the user that we add to tomcat-user.xml", 
   "- The roles are calculated depending on what webapps are installed (only manager, vs. host-manager, vs. both of them).", 
   "- Do not display \"username\", \"password\", \"roles\" fields when neither manager nor host-manager are selected. In the previous version we showed them as disabled. Now we do not show them on screen.", 
   "- Add support for the '/?' command line option. It displays a message box. See .onInit function in tomcat.nsi for details. (r1034911, kkolinko)", 
   "- When installing on Windows, do not leave undeleted stale files in $TEMP/src/res/confinstall/. Pack only needed fines, not duplicates. Place those files into $PLUGINSDIR instead of $TEMP.", 
   "- Add DetailPrint statements for operations that take noticeable time. (r1034924, kkolinko)", 
   "- Improve descriptions of the components. (r964211, r1035051)"
