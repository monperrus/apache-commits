   "in order to make DTD preparsing/cacing work, I had to make the document scanners aware whether there was a need to build a grammar (and hence to expand entities).  I also had to add some new functionality to the DTD scanner so that it can be reset outside of a component manager.  (it could be argued that the DTD preparser should be a componentManager, but I saw no reason to complicate the implementation by doing that at this stage.)"

   "implementing DTD grammar caching/preparsing.  XMLDTDProcessor is what XMLDTDLoader used to be; XMLDTDLoader extends XMLDTDProcessor by adding functionality specifically needed for preparsing.  The limited testing I have done appears to indicate that this set-up does indeed succeed in caching DTD grammars both when preparsed (as external subsets) and when loaded as part of parsing an instance.  I will post a message describing in more detail what I have done here on the xerces-j-dev list tomorrow."
