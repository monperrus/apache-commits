   "Added initial cut of the commons-sql codebase. This originally came from Jason, then I've hacked it a little.", 
   "Its essentially a simple bean library that allows a database schema to be read from XML or written to XML via Betwixt that can then be used to autogenerate code, SQL DDL etc.", 
   "I'm experimenting using Jelly to generate the DDL in some XML that can then be evaluated at will.", 
   "Though the old Velocity scripts from Torque have been preserved.", 
   "Ultimately it'd be cool if this could be packaged up as a Maven plugin so we can autocreate the generation of bean source code, OJB repository definitions, DDL, HTML documentation etc."
