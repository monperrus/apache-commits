   "More work exploring the policy extension model by implementing a token based authentication schema across binding.ws and binding.jm. No authentication is actually performed here. That is left for users to provide their own policy interceptors. However tokens are passed and security Subjects/Principals are created. This exercise has highlighted some awkwardness in the process of building policy implementations. I'll post about this on the mail list."
