   "Makes use of UtilValidate.is(Not)Empty() everywhere it makes senses. This for 2 reasons:", 
   "* Make the code more readable by replacing the (!)null/isEmpty pattern.", 
   "* Avoid possible NPEs when only isEmpty() was used (after Entity.find... for instance). I found a lot of cases (242 today) where isEmpty() could perhaps be replaced in Framework. But I guess no NPE checks were missing there and anyway it was too much for me to check them all... So I only did the relevant changes in Applications..."
