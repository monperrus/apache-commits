   "Committed DERBY-555 for \u00d8ystein Gr\u00f8vlen (oystein.grovlen@sun.com):", 
   "With this patch, when a database is booted in read-only mode, the boot message in derby.log will contain information about that.", 
   "I have also added a test, TurnsReadOnly.java, that without the fix, get the NPE. This is not in a disk full scenario, but it also occurs with a read-only DB directory. Since there is currently no way to turn write access back on from a Java program, the DB directory will be read-only after the test is run. Hence, the test framework will not be able to clean up the test directory. Therefore, this test is not added to the derbyall test suite.",
