   "update non-major compaction logic to use two threshold values: minimum sstables to compact (4) and maximum to compact at once (32).  before, the same threshold (4) was used for both.  the new logic lets the system recover faster from a bulk load that generates sstables faster than compaction can combine them.  patch by Chris Goffinet and jbellis for CASSANDRA-407"
