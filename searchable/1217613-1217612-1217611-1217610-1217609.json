   "Committed another part of the Issue 728. It is carefully tested for images, documents and presentations, other paths still may contain small glitches in the command line.", 
   "This is another step forward to use localized document names. By replacing command shell batch scripts with direct Runtime.exec() calls I remove requirement for using the batch file encoding which is hard to guess from the Java environment. A debug is performed by copying the command line from the error message window to the command line shell."
