   "A patch from Ren\u00e9 Scheibe <<\"createUpdateBillingAddressAndPaymentMethod\" service called from one page checkout throws Exception due to incorrect field name>> (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-3887) - OFBIZ-3887", 
   "Problem:", 
   "The method \"createUpdateBillingAddressAndPaymentMethod\" in CheckoutServices.xml refers to a \"billToCardSecurityCode\" parameter, which is not existing.", 
   "Instead OnePageCheckoutProcess.ftl defines this field with id=\"CVV2\" and name=\"cardSecurityCode\".", 
   "Solution:", 
   "1. Change the \"id\" and \"name\" in OnePageCheckoutProcess.ftl to meet the attribute name of \"createUpdateBillingAddressAndPaymentMethod\".", 
   "2. Extend the attribute mapping line in CheckoutServices.xml so that in case the CVV2 is not entered by the user, the field is defined anyway. (otherwise groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException is still thrown as the field is always accessed)"
