   "LUCENE-1695: Update the Highlighter to use the new TokenStream API. This issue breaks backwards compatibility with some public classes. If you have implemented custom Fregmenters or Scorers,  you will need to adjust them to work with the new TokenStream API. Rather than getting passed a Token at a time, you will be given a TokenStream to init your impl with - store the Attributes you are interested in locally and access them on each call to the method that used to pass a new Token. Look at the included updated impls for examples."
