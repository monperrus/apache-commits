   "testTimeout failed on the last Hudson run after I added the fix for SHIRO-133 (that did modify the behaviof of SessionValidator). However, it doesn't seems there's anything wrong with the code. The test is unreliable since it's unpredictable when exactly the executor runs the next time. Made the test more robust by touching the session just before the setTimeout() (that caused it to fail, i.e. it expired even before when it was expected to expire)"
