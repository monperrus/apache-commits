   "Updated the handling of the components to factor in support for determining automatically if a dependency is a shared library and referencing it as one in jbi.xml.  Also updated the service assembly so that a dependency doesn't need to have type jbi-service-unit as the plugin checked the artifacts POM for packaging.  Also added an archetype for the shared library for completeness"
