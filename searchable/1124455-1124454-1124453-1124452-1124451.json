   "-Processor interface is extended to handle create, update and delete requests.", 
   "-Each processor previously located under JCR bundle has implemented Processor interface. They have been moved into the core bundle as they are used by more than one bundle i.e Web and JCR.", 
   "-MappingEngine interface is also extended so that it will accept create, update and delete requests.", 
   "-Configurations of MappingEngine is set through a MappingConfiguration object.", 
   "-ConceptBridgeProcessor has been extended such that it can handle ClassificationObjects in general with or without bridges. In the same way, InstanceBridgeProcessor can handle ContentObjects. So their names were updated.", 
   "-Ordering mechanism is added as execution order of processors is important. The order is adjusted so that first ObjectTypes then ClassificationObjects and finally ContentObjects are mapped."
