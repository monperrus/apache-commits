   "Yoko-110 :- Support for multiple idl files to be generated for multiple bindings. This is an all or nothing appoach - in that if you specify a binding - then it just generates the idl for that binding - if you specify the idl flag - it doesn't require you to name every binding in the wsdl - but you can specify the list of idl files to be generated by the -o option with filename.idl,filename2.idl etc. otherwise it does as it does for the single case and gives the idl a default name based on the binding name.", 
   "Also the -w option has been added if you want to name the wsdl file generated when generating a binding for the specifed portType. If a -corba is specified and you don't specify a portType then it will generate bindings for all portTypes within the wsdl file.", 
   "If -w is not specified it generates a default named wsdl file."
