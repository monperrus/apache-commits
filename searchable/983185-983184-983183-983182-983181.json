   "Removed modules/samples/pom.xml. It was actually not doing anything useful anymore:", 
   "* It has a surefire configuration, but no unit tests are ever executed.", 
   "* It packages a version.aar file (in the process-test-resources phase ?!?) that was originally used for inclusion in the binary distribution. However:", 
   "** The AAR is built using ant and not attached to the project.", 
   "** modules/samples/version/pom.xml builds the version.aar file properly (as a Maven artifact) using the axis2-aar-maven-plugin.", 
   "** In r777897, the build of binary distribution was changed to use the version.aar Maven artifact produced by modules/samples/version/pom.xml instead of the AAR produced by modules/samples/pom.xml.", 
   "* modules/samples/pom.xml has jar packaging, but the generated JAR only contains two XML files, namely service4withhandler.xml and services.xml."
