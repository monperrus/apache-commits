   "Added a new utility class, spark.util.TextFlowUtil, for importing a TextFlow from TLF markup or exporting a TextFlow to TFL markup.", 
   "Since a TextFlow is the central object in the Text Layout Framework, the API for the Spark RichText, RichEditableText, and TextArea components will soon change to focus on representing rich content by a TextFlow rather than by markup. Markup awareness will be removed from these classes, and developers will use TextFlowUtil to do the conversions.",
