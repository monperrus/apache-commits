   "bug 3061: if bayes_learn_to_journal was set (sa-learn --norebuild does this too), and no bayes DB already existed, the learn would fail because tie_db_readonly() wouldn't create a db if it didn't already exist.  so we now failback to tieing r/w if r/o fails only if learn_to_journal is set.  cleaned up a bit of bayesdbm.t as well."
