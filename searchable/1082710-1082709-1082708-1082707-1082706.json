   "Removed testAddressBasedReplyTo as the above  test cases cover it adequately.", 
   "Currently the testReplyToWithNamelessExchange fails with the java.0.10 test profile.", 
   "This is due to the default being BURL and the replyTo address is evaluated as a BURL and as part of the logic an exchange declare is being set.", 
   "The C++ broker does seem to ignore the exchange declare of a known type (the nameless exchange in this case), while the java broker throws an exception."
