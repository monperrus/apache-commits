   "Initial support for truncation in TextBox and TextGraphic.", 
   "Their base class, TextGraphicElement, now has a truncation:int property. It defaults to 0, meaning \"no truncation\". Setting it to a positive integer such as 3 means \"truncate to 3 lines\", or fewer if 3 won't fit. Setting it to -1 means \"truncate to as many lines as will fit\".", 
   "Truncation does not work when lineBreak is \"explicit\".", 
   "The truncation indicator is a locale-dependent resource, the same one as for Halo text: the \"truncationIndicator\" resource in the \"core\" bundle. For en_US it is three periods; I don't remember why we haven't been using a single ellipsis character.", 
   "TextGraphic implements this property using the new TruncationOptions class usable with TLF's TextLineFactory. TextBox does not yet implement truncation, but will.", 
   "There is currently a TLF bug that if you apply truncation the Flex styles are ignored.",
