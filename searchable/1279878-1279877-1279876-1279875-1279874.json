   "Fixed issues with popups and effects. We were incorrectly grabbing the location of the popup before it was actually on the stage - AnimateTransform should not capture values of unparented objects (it should instead lazily grab location values from the object as the animation begins). Also, the alpha value of the popup was being clobbered by the value in the owning anchor. Finally, the auto-fading logic which temporarily adds in a disappearing object was not accounting for the popup parent of SystemManager.",
