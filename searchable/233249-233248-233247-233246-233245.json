   "Fixing some things:", 
   "o Artifact attachment via MavenProjectHelper was using string literals of the variables I was trying to use to fill in type and classifier (dumb, I know!)", 
   "o Source plugin didn't have an @phase for the JarSourceMojo...added, then added the goal configuration in the release profile in the super-pom", 
   "o Removed the source plugin bindings for the lifecycle mappings in maven-core", 
   "o Re-added [deprecated] method MavenProjectBuilder.build( File, ArtifactRepository, List )...you should use MavenProjectBuilder.build( File, ArtifactRepository, ProfileManager ) instead.", 
   "o Added profile handling/injection for the super-pom in two places: in buildStandaloneSuperPom() and in private build(..). This enables injection of the release profile which is provided in the super-pom.", 
   "o Added integration test to verify that using -DperformRelease=true results in the sources being attached...to override this behavior, another profile keyed on -DperformRelease could turn the 'attach' param for the source plugin off."
