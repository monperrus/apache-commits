   "Making a performance change in MobileIconItemRenderer/MobileItemRenderer in how we measure text.  We don't call UIComponent.measureText() anymore as that creates another TextField behind the scenes and changes its text.  Instead we now just ask for the textWidth/textHeight of the TextField we are already using.  This change should give us about a 10-15% improvement.  I added a FIXME to change it in ButtonSkin and look for other places we need to change it as well.", 
   "Also, I'm making some changes in the way we measure FPS in TestHelper for RadioStations to be more consistent.",

   "- Modified the Scroller algorithm used in calculating the scrollAnchorPoint (the point where the scroll starts).  Now instead of using the mouseEvent coordinates where the threshold was crossed, we now calculate the threshold and use that instead.  In practice, a user probably wouldn't notice this much (unless there was a big delay between MouseMoves for some reason). However, this calculation is the right thing to do, and will help produce more consistent results with regards to QE and programatically faking the mouse events.",
