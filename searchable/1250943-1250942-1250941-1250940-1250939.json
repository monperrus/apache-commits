   "When a UIMovieClip resizes, it does so through scaling. Before UIMC was keeping track of this on it's own.  Now that AdvancedLayoutFeatures support this through scaleX/scaleY, UIMC can now rely on this behavior.  This also helps fix some Effects bugs which rely on this to figure out the difference in transformations that get applied and contribute to the \"width\" and \"height\" properties and ones that don't.",

   "For the FlashContainerPlaceholder, the first child is now MyFlexContentHolder, which extends mx.flash.FlexContentHolder but meets the invariant that it has 1 child and that child is  FlexContentHolderThumbnail, which I\u2019ve added as a swc to the project.  I changed this by accident last time to refer to mx.flash.FlexContentHolder, when it should've referred to a concrete instance created by Flash from a swc.  I also added a chrome of 151x151 to match the FlexContentHolderThumbnail since otherwise the container itself would have no chrome at all, and this let\u2019s it size correctly.", 
   "Also, for sizing, in a container, rather than sizing to the size of the chrome, I now size to the size of the FlexContentHolder thumbnail that all FlexContentHolder\u2019s have.  This means in ContainerMovieClip, I don\u2019t need to override bounds anymore.", 
   "ContainerMovieClip now implements IVisualElementContainer.",
