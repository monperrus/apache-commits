   "I had a look at type=\"Double\" in *SimpleMethods*.xml, *events*.xml, *formula*.xml, *services*.xml, *tests*.xml files and I found only this one (about currency) to be changed to BigDecimal. I think others occurrences are ok since they deal about rate or quantity. Else it's not a big deal to change them, so please (Scott, David?) let me know, thanks"
