   "[UIMA-1928] remove the build plugin to run the jira report from the parent pom - it gets run by all the child poms.  Instead, put into just those child poms that want to run the jira-report, the bit of xml to cause it to run.  Note that this can't be done for the parent-pom itself, so for this one, we have to run the report by hand."
