   "various fixes related to archetype: fixes for the archetype itself; but also: had to move installer-registry.properties from root into org/apache/isis/core/runtime; renamed 'allow' and 'passwords' to security_file.allow and security_file.passwords; added RedirectServlet and ForwardingServlet into core/webapp; changed wicket-viewer so that picks up application.css from WEB-INF rather than from classpath.  In addition: uploaded site/resources/presentations for download; fixed the build problem from Rob's new aggregatedOid support"
