   "[MASSEMBLY-194] Adding useTransitiveFiltering flag to dependencySets (default value == false). When false, includes/excludes apply only to the current artifact, not to the list of artifacts that bring this artifact in transitively. When true, the transitive path of the current artifact is taken into account for filtering includes/excludes. By default, backward compatibility with version 2.1 of the assembly plugin means we have to set this to false."
