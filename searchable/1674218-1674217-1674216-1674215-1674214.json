   "Well, this is the start of converting ofbiz to use maven for building",

   "* mvn compile", 
   "* mvn package",

   "default file layout away from src/main/java and target/*, to something", 
   "more ofbiz specific.  This way of doing things is just to get things", 
   "going; eventually, we should adopt a more standard maven like layout.", 
   "Another thing not dealt with in these first 2 files, is downloading of", 
   "dependencies.  The top-level and framework/start have no external", 
   "requirements, so it allowed me to get going quite quickly."
