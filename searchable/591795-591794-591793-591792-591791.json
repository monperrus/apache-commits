   "Fix BZ 42038: Correct overlay of mounts and unmounts for IIS.", 
   "For IIS we check for mounts using two passes, once with the URL with",

   "with the original URL.", 
   "The semantics of unmount are, that first all mounts must be checked,",

   "over an unmount during the first pass.",

   "name as another parameter.", 
   "Refactored the mapping function a little, by moving out the search for a match,", 
   "which we now need to call twice.", 
   "Also removed some logging from IIS, because the same infomration gets", 
   "logged inside the mapping function on the same level."
