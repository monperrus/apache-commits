   "[master] Unit test for log splitting on master failover", 
   "Summary:", 
   "While trying to improve master failover I realized that I would have to modify", 
   "the way we detect what logs to split on master startup. This is a unit test that", 
   "starts a load, waits until half of the data is loaded, kills a regionserver,", 
   "then kills the master, lets the backup master take over, and verifies that only", 
   "the dead regionserver's logs have been split. The data load continues in", 
   "background and when it finishes, the loaded data is verified, too. The test runs", 
   "in two modes: regular and distributed log splitting.", 
   "This patch also imports a few useful pieces of code from the trunk.", 
   "Test Plan: Run all unit tests", 
   "Reviewers: pkhemani, kranganathan, liyintang, kannan",
