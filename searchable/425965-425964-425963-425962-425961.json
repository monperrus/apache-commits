   "Commit of Rajith's patch from BEEHIVE-1131.  This patch provides the initial implementation of reflection based creation of a WsmService object that can be used to wire-up a web service.", 
   "Note, I've changed the original patch slightly to move the generated annogen beans from \"javax.jws\" into \"org.apache.beehive.wsm.axis.annogen\".  This provides more of a separation from the JSR's API and the annogen implementation of the same.", 
   "This change passes the existing tests, though there aren't any JDK 1.4 tests that use this directly.",
