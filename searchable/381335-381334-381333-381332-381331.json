   "DERBY-788: 'store/encryptionKey.sql' fails on Solaris 10", 
   "Contributed by Kristian Waagan <Kristian.Waagan@Sun.COM>.", 
   "'DERBY-788-1a.diff' is a patch that replaces the 16 byte key with a 8", 
   "byte key for the DES encryption algorithm used in the test", 
   "'store/encryptionKey.sql'. The test still exercises the intended parts", 
   "of the Derby code (according to my own analysis and that of", 
   "Sunitha). The patch makes the test stop failing on Solaris10 (with", 
   "security provider 'SunPCKS11-Solaris') .", 
   "One test case is changed; where it previously tested a key that was of", 
   "incorrect length (longer than 8 bytes, shorter than 16), it now tests", 
   "an incorrect key of the correct length. It is not possible to make the", 
   "test pass on Solaris10 with a key of incorrect length, because keys of", 
   "length less than 8 bytes are caught by a check in the code, and keys", 
   "longer than 8 bytes cause the underlying security provider to fail", 
   "('SunPCKS11-Solaris'). This issue will be addressed in DERBY-1001", 
   "(rewrite of test to a JUnit-test)."
