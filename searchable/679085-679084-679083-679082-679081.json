   "TUSCANY-2324 - as a follow on from TUSCANY-2484 allow an interface contract to be retrieved from a reference based on the bindings that needs it. For component references information in the endpoint structure is used to find the correct interface contract. I've wrapped this in a method on the contract now though as we are not ready yet to make the endpoint structure more prominent. A piece of work is now required to make use of this information when bindings that required is are configured."
