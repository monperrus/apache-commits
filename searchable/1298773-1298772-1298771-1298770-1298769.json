   "Added an alternative client-side HTTP transport based on the java.net.HttpURLConnection API. It supports keep-alive connections, but doesn't impose additional constraints on application code (such as singleton service locators).",

   "- it requires Java 1.5 (while the Axis core should still continue to support Java 1.4);", 
   "- the current code can be used with earlier versions of Axis (it was tested with Axis 1.3 and 1.4)."
