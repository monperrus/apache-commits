   "* Added a JMSConnectionFactoryManager class that centralises the management of the set of JMSConnectionFactory instances defined in the transport configuration. JMSConnectionFactoryManager is reused by both JMSListener and JMSSender. This allows us to eliminate some duplicate code and gives the implementation more structure.", 
   "* Added JMSSender#stop to shut down all connections when the sender stops. This eliminates the resource leak described in SYNAPSE-448.", 
   "* Removed the equals method in JMSConnectionFactory. It violated the basic contract of the Object class. The code in that method has been moved to a lookup method in JMSConnectionFactoryManager."
