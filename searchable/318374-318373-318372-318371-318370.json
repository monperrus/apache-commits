   "fix for bug #8617.  In the case of an internal parameter entity, we were assuming that the global XMLString containing the entity value would remain unchanged even after we requested that spaces between the terminating quote of the entity value and the > had been consumed.  Especially in space-rich documents, this was not necessarily the case since a buffer boundary might exist in the spaces; if one did, the XMLString would change and the entity value would be corrupted.

   "Note that there is also a bug in nonNormalized values for parameter entities which contain references to other parameter entities.  This will not be easy to fix; I note it here for the record."
