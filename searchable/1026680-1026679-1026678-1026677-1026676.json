   "SHIRO-204: committed implementation.  HashedCredentialsMatcher is now no longer abstract and all of its subclasses have been deprecated.  Introduced new SimpleHash implementation to allow ad-hoc hash algorithms to be used and all existing AbstractHash subclasses (Md5Hash, etc) have been updated to subclass SimpleHash instead of AbstractHash directly.  AbstractHash has been marked deprecated."
