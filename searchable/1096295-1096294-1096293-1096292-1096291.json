   "Initial demand by Michael P\u00e4tzold", 
   "At the moment we concentrate on increasing the usability of the backend application. One thing we recognized is the way form errors are reported to the users.

   "JLR: I have added a required field to InternalName field in Edit Product Form. There are maybe other cases like that which should be improved..."
