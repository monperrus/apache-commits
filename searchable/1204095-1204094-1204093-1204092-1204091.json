   "I've removed the WARP tests as we use the spec in a slightly different way to how most mobile widget runtimes implement it, which is what the W3C test suite is aimed at. In Wookie we use WARP to add policies to a server-side proxy rather than to configure the webview in which the widget runs - in our case this is determined by the browser, not by us. So it doesn't really make sense to try and pass the standard WARP tests as these would mean doing some odd things to the browser that wouldn't make any sense for users. See WOOKIE-245."
