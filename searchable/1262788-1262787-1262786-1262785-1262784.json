   "Add IViewport properties to FxContainer and FxDataContainer.  This is using a new property delegation pattern.  This pattern may be refined later on.  For part of it, we are doing bit manipulation to store a set of booleans efficiently.  I removed the Flags32 class and replaced it with static helpers because it's more efficient without the object overhead.  So I cleaned up Button and ToggleButton to use the new static helper class.",
