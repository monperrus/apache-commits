The fix is to default oldLayoutDirection to \"ltr\" so that we skip some of these calls at start up. We also need to make oldLayoutDirection mx_internal so that subclasses that don't call super.validateDisplayList() can update oldLayoutDirection correctly.",

   "Fix for http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-25909 and another underlying List/Tree/DataGrid issue. The bug was that the dragProxy for a TileList and HorizontalList didn't have the right layoutDirection causing it to be incorrectly positioned. While investigating the issue, I found that there was some fallout from changing SpriteAsset. The selection and rollover highlights on a List were disappearing. It turns out that List and DataGrid create their own SpriteAssets for creating certain indicators (like highlight and selection), while Tree creates it to wrap the disclosureIcon.", 
   "The fix for first bug is to set the layoutDirection of the dragProxy to \u201crtl\u201d when the dragInitiator is also \"rtl\". It doesn\u2019t inherit the layoutDirection because it is a child of the systemManager. I\u2019ve also included the fix for the fallout from SpriteAsset by setting layoutDirection on those specific instances to null (inheriting) instead of their default \u201cltr\u201d.",
