   "This patch fixes 2 defects [1] [2] in Beans module caused by java.beans.StandardBeanInfo class.", 
   "[1] If a bean class has \"public boolean isProperty(int)\" and \"public boolean getProperty(int)\" methods, RI takes getProperty(int) as read method of this \"property\", while HARMONY takes isProperty(int) method", 
   "[2] If a bean class has \"public boolean isProperty(int)\" and \"public void setProperty(int, boolean)\" methods, HARMONY fails to find this \"property\" while RI finds it and only regards setProperty(int, boolean) as its write method.", 
   "Moreover, this patch includes 17 test cases to reflect those problems."
