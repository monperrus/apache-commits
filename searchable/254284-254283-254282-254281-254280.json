   "My next step in revamping WSDL2Java was rewriting JavaWriter (and", 
   "consequently all its subclasses).  Primarily, the changes are:", 
   "1. JavaWriter is broken into two abstract classes:  JavaWriter and", 
   "subclass JavaClassWriter.  JavaDeployWriter and JavaUndeployWriter", 
   "extend JavaWriter directly.  The rest, since they all generate Java classes,", 
   "extend JavaClassWriter.  In the old version, JavaDeployWriter and", 
   "JavaUndeployWriter did some hokey things to fit into the class model.",

   "JavaClassWriter(Emitter e, String filename, String type).  Less has to be", 
   "known/calculated in the constructor.", 
   "3. Most write methods now take a PrintWriter parameter instead of", 
   "assuming the superclass has a PrintWriter.  This makes it easy to embed", 
   "one generated class inside another (JavaBeanHelperWriter).", 
   "4. There is now behaviour on JavaWriter and JavaClassWriter.  This", 
   "behavior makes it easier to do piecemeal extensions.",
