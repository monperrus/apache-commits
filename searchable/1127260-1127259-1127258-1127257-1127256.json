   "Moved all invocations of the maven-javadoc-plugin from the <reporting/> tag to the <build/> tag (phase \"site\") and make sure that every configuration is bound to a single execution.", 
   "Rationale: When a configuration for maven-javadoc-plugin is specified in the <reporting/> tag (as was the case in the testkit module), Maven 2.2 (but not 3.0) applies that configuration also to the maven-javadoc-plugin execution defined by the org.apache:apache super-POM (and which is triggered by the apache-release profile). The change described above will avoid this confusion and seems to work with all Maven versions (2.2.x and 3.0.x), goals (clean install or clean site) and profiles (apache-release or no profile), although I didn't test all combinations.", 
   "Side effect: mvn site:site will no longer produce the Javadoc. Instead, mvn site must be used (which should be used anyway, at least to generate the site for publication)."
