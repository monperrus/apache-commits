   "Removed the custom CachedClassLoader and related artifacts in favour of a simpler bootstrap process and a simpler classpath tree; now the classpath tree is made of: bootstrap classloader (primordial+ext) -> system classloader (aka applications or classpath classloader) -> two custom classloaders (one loads the framework/base classes and one loads all the other classes) -> Webapp classloaders (one per web application).", 
   "Junit tests are included. The two custom classloaders could be merged into one but this will be addressed in a second phase because it will require some changes to the bootstrap componenr and process."
