   "Fix to transform effects to ignore projection on 2D effects. The prior implementation meant that even 2D effects, like Move, would cause us to set the projection information on a target object's container, even though we were not changing 3D values.", 
   "The fix is to set the default values of the projection properties to false in AnimateTransformInstance. That way, any 3D effect (AnimateTransform3D or its subclasses) would cuase the properties to be set according to the 3D defaults (or values that the developer set them to), whereas any 2D effect would leave the values false, which would result in our ignoring the projection matrix for that effect.",

   "Fixed various effects bugs.", 
   "23236: Easing was being ignored for properties being auto-animated (basically, the post-layout transform center). This caused a mis-match between a resizing animation and a move animation, causing the object to swim back and forth as the easing on these animations were out of sync. This also fixes the high-priority 23856 bug, which was closed as a dup of 23236.", 
   "23421: There is a player bug related to a null concatenatedMatrix property on DisplayObjects which causes a mis-calculation of mouse hit testing when the matrix is changed too late in the frame cycle. Since we do not validate our properties until enterFrame or render time, this sometimes causes Flash to detect mouseOut on objects that the mouse is still over when the object goes in and out of 3D in that frame. This fix works around that player bug by forcing matrix validation early when we detect a 2D/3D switch.", 
   "23484: The transform code in AdvancedLayoutFeatures needed to account for stretchX/stretchY when using computedMatrix and computedMatrix3D. These matrices assume pre-stretched values. Since our transforms expect post-stretched values, they need to divide out the stretchX/Y values before using these matrices.",
