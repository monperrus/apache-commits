   "Remove the call to ldapssl_install_routines for the Novell SDK.  Do to the warning that states that if any other ldap call is made between the calls to ldap_init() and ldapssl_install_routines(), it is safer for the Novell SDK to always initialize the connection using ldapssl_init(). Suggest that other SDKs do the same."
