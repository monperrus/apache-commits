   "[ 1385445 ] Filtering duplicate feedback messages", 
   "I don't like the idea of context sensitive filtering.  The filter is simple and good as it is.  I have added something else to solve this problem instead:  Extend FeedbackPanel and override newFeedbackMessagesModel() to provide your own custom feedback messages model.  In that custom subclass of FeedbackMessagesModel, override processMessages() and do whatever arbitrary thing you want to do to the list of messages.  The list of FeedbackMessage objects passed to this method will be already filtered and sorted.  To remove duplicates, just go through the list and remove them."
