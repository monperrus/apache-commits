   "VCL-23", 
   "Made several minor improvements to Windows modules during testing.", 
   "Windows_mod.pm:", 
   "-Added check for 'end_state' argument in pre_capture() so child classes don't have to check for it", 
   "-Set pre_capture() to disable RDP before capture instead of enabling it for 10.x.x.x addresses in case these addresses are used for public access. Also set post_load to enable RDP on the private interface.", 
   "-Added call to post_load() to set the computer name. The script that runs during Sysprep does not always work correctly.", 
   "-Commented out disable_netbios() and disable_dynamic_dns() calls from post_load() to speed things up. These can be controlled by OS config variables some day.", 
   "-Moved grant_access() and revoke_access() within the file so they appear under the pod section for interface functions.", 
   "-Added max_depth argument and default setting to delete_files_by_pattern(). This was running very slow on Vista when searching directories with many files.", 
   "-Changed enable_pagefile() and disable_pagefile() to call reg.exe instead of importing a .reg file. The pagefile key should be a REG_MULTI_SZ. This type is difficult to configure using a .reg file.", 
   "-Changed enable_pagefile() to set the registry key to C:\\pagefile.sys instead of ?:\\pagefile.sys. The question mark string worked but the interface to control the pagefile did not reflect the actual setting properly.", 
   "-Changed import_registry_string() to name the temporary .reg file after the sub and line number which called it so it's easy to determine where the .reg file came from.", 
   "-Added shutdown() subroutine. This is called after newsid.exe runs.", 
   "-Changed run_newsid() to not rename the computer. This is done elsewhere.", 
   "-Added commands to disable_dynamic_dns() to disable DNS updating for each adapter.", 
   "-Added firewall_enable_rdp_private() sub which will allow RDP only on the private interface.", 
   "-Added get_node_configuration_directory() so child classes can use the variable stored in Windows_mod.pm. It is the location on the node where VCL files are stored.", 
   "-Added set_computer_name() which sets registry entries to rename the computer.", 
   "Version_5.pm:", 
   "-Added argument to SUPER::pre_capture() call to pass the args which were passed to it.", 
   "XP_mod.pm:", 
   "-Removed end_state argument check. This was moved up to Windows_mod.pm so other classes don't duplicate the code. This is only possible by passing the arguments up to the parent's subroutine.", 
   "Added Version_6.pm, Version_6 directory, and Vista_mod.pm."
