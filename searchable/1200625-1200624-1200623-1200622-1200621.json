   "Summary:", 
   "We ran an incremental scrape with HFileOutputFormat and", 
   "encountered major compaction storms. This is caused by the bug in", 
   "HBASE-3404. The permanent fix is a little tricky without HBASE-2856. We", 
   "realized that a quicker solution for avoiding these compaction storms is", 
   "to simply exclude bulk import files from minor compactions and let them",
