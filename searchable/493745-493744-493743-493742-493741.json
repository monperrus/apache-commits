   "Adding Filtered SubtreeSpecification support to the core.", 
   "Now, entries can be selected via LDAP filters as well as Refinements.", 
   "This improves the capability of all services that depends on the Administrative Model: Collective Attributes, Authorization, Triggers.", 
   "This may have some side effects, we'll see.", 
   "One thing missing is that I did not update the SubtreeSpecification bean to replace refinement with a more general term filterExpr. Still all API uses the term refinement but it's really either a Refinement or a Filter."
