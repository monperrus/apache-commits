   "Added a configuration property to specify the port of a particular endpoint without having to specify the actual URL. This can be useful when you want to use the default contexts, but change the standard default port of 9000 to something else. The property is called org.apache.cxf.ws.port and can be set to desired default port number such as \"12345\".",
