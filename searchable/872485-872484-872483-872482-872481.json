   "where the source tree is located, this still didn't work for me.",

   "It turned out to be a problem specific to BSD make.", 
   "With GNU make, things worked fine.", 
   "The problem was that in build-outputs.mk, the generated binding", 
   "source files were preceeded with '$(top_builddir)/' when listed", 
   "as targets, but did not have any prefix (i.e. were relative paths)", 
   "when listed as dependencies. BSD make is apparently too naive to", 
   "figure out that e.g. 'foo.c' and './foo.c' are meant to refer to", 
   "the same file.", 
   "Since '$(top_builddir)' is hardcoded to just '.' (a dot)", 
   "at the top of Makefile.in, it is redundant and can be ommitted.",

   "* build/generator/gen_make.py", 
   "(Generator.write): Don't prefix the names of generated binding", 
   "source files with '$(top_builddir)/' when listing them as target,", 
   "because this confuses BSD make. When listed as dependencies,", 
   "the files do not have this prefix either."
