   "SCXML-197: Better separation of concern between SCXMLExecutor and SCInstance and introducing a new SCXMLExecutionContext", 
   "See: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SCXML-196 and http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SCXML-197", 
   "This replaces the existing SCXMLSemantics completely with a new definition and implementation conforming to the current SCXML specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-scxml-20140313/#AlgorithmforSCXMLInterpretation", 
   "As this also required major structural changes, which actually 'fitted well' with SCXML-197, the result is also a far better, almost complete, separation of concerns between SCXMLExecutor, SCInstance and SCXMLExecutionContext.",
