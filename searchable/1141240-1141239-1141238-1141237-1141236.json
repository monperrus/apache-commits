   "Several improvements to the Flatpack feature (see WOOKIE-182). (1) the controller uses the widgetserver properties to construct the return path for the exported .wgt rather than just the request (see WOOKIE-111). (2) feature resources are added once in the factory, not every time a start file is processed. (3) Improved code comments and formatting."
