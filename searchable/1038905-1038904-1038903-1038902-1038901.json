   "Enable Roller 5 to run on JBoss AS 6", 
   "Changes needed to run Roller on JBoss 6 AS and to enable creating both a Tomcat release and a release designed to run on Java EE 6 application servers.", 
   "* Turned off OpenJPA bytecode enhancement to get Roller to run on Hibernate, so added -Djavaee=true flag to allow bytecode enhancement to be turned off.", 
   "* Added two assemblies to weblogger-assembly: 'for-javaee' to create a Java EE 6 release and 'for-tomcat' to create a Tomcat release.", 
   "* Had to set some Hibernate properties, so I enhanced JPAPersistenceStrategy classes to pass along JPA and Hibernate properties in addition to the Open JPA ones it already does.", 
   "* To run on JBoss's JPA, we need the following properties, so I added them to roller.properties:", 
   "hibernate.transaction.factory_class=\\", 
   "org.hibernate.transaction.JTATransactionFactory", 
   "hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class=\\", 
   "org.hibernate.transaction.JBossTransactionManagerLookup", 
   "* Also added non-JTA datasource java:/RollerDS to persistence.xml, a setting that is ignored when the JUnit tests are run and when Roller is run on Tomcat.", 
   "* JBoss 6 AS requires the 'mapped-name' element in web.xml so I upgraded Roller's web.xml to Servlets 2.5, and uncomment the datasource and mail session resource refs there.", 
   "* Added a jboss-web.xml to map from Roller's jdbc/rollerdb to java:/RollerDS, but need to check if this is really needed.", 
   "* Found some issues in Struts 2.1.8, so I upgraded to Struts 2.2.1. This also added a runtime dependency on Javassist.", 
   "* Needed to fix bug in String Taglib, which is a dead project, so removed dependency on String Taglib and added source for the five tags used by Roller."
