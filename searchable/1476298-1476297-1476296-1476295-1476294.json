   "Some bug fixes for entity engine caches. GenericDelegator was inconsistent in clearing caches - some methods cleared the cache before the entity operation (wrong) while others cleared the cache after the entity operation (right). Also, I updated the Delegator JavaDocs to warn against skipping the cache clearing step - which shouldn't be done. Finally, the AbstractEntityConditionCache.storeHook method doesn't work (for a number of reasons) so I bypassed it."
