   "Fix sources/javadoc jars md5 checksum generation - this was a copy/paste error with the checksum for these files being written to the main jar's property and unfortunately the ant checksum task doesn't overwrite the property value if it is already set (so when generating multiple checksums each has to use a different property name) - thanks to Phil Steitz for spotting this."
