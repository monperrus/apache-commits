   "Use JUnit 4 features (custom test runners) to systematically validate test cases against Sun's SAAJ reference implementation. All test cases annotation with @Validated are run twice: once with Sun's SAAJ implementation (to validate the test case itself) and once with axis2-saaj (to validate our code). This should make it easier to write test cases that conform to the SAAJ specs. The mechanism implemented by SAAJTestRunner is completely transparent to Maven's Surefire plugin as well as Eclipse's JUnit launcher."
