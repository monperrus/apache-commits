   "Drop MAGIC KEYS.  They turn out to slow things down a little, and the fact that their magic survives assignment is a bad thing- users could assign a key to a global variable that is used in many different requests.  The magic pointer is corrupt once the current request pool cleans it up, so only bad things can happen after that.  There seems to be no upside to MAGIC KEYS now that APR::Table handles multivalued keys correctly, so that experiment dies here."
