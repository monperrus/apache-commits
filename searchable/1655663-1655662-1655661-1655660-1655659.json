   "SLING-3750 : introducing a new feature which avoids duplicate-leaders-on-startup: the INIT event is now delayed (when configured to do so) until there is a valid, established cluster view. Earlier it used to immediately send an INIT on bind-topologylistener/activate - but if the voting was not finished yet (no established view yet), all it could do is come up with an 'isolated view' containing only itself. And since every cluster view has a leader, it automatically became leader. The new approach is more stable as it waits for the first voting to conclude. That might delay startup though - this is something to keep in mind here. Default of the new config is enabled nevertheless as IMO this is how it should be."
