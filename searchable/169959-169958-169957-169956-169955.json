There were *two* constructors for ExpressionMessage, one that evaluated expressions in the message-args (and thus required some additional parameters), and one that didn't.  The form bean in the bug repro case was using the latter.", 
   "This confusion was unnecessary, though, since an earlier refactor made it possible to evaluate expressions in args without the extra parameters to the ExpressionMessage constructor.  I removed the large constructor and made the smaller one expression-aware, so the repro case now works as-is.",
