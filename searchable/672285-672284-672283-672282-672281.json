   "SYNAPSE-374:", 
   "* Modified SynapseLog, MediatorLog and AbstractMediator so that logging SynapseExceptions can be done through the SynapseLog interface.", 
   "* Added two convenience constructors to SynapseException that allow to log and throw the exception in a single instruction. This is better than handleException because it allows the compiler to see that an exception is thrown. The compiler can then do proper flow analysis, avoiding complaints about uninitialized variables and missing return statements."
