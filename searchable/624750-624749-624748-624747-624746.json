   "WikiContext's getURL() method now defaults to HttpUtil's method of building the base URL from user session request information, rather than from jspwiki.baseURL. We do this so that JSPWiki will work nicely with HTTPS sessions. This method is transparent to downstream JSP tags like EditLink; they get HTTP compatibility \"for free\". If the associated HTTPServletRequest is null, we default to the old method of looking up getBaseURL() from WikiEngine."
