   "Exposed the option to create either static or dynamic associations between bundles and groups. Dynamic associations automatically keep pointing to the newest version of a bundle, whereas static associations keep pointing to the version of the bundle you associated the group to. Dynamic associations make it easier to update bundles, as the only thing you need to do is to simply add the new version of the bundle and all associations will find it. The option applies to associations you create, so once an association has been created, it won't change. The button can be found in the top right corner, and it's a non-persistent toggle button, meaning you loose its setting when you end your session (because we're not yet logging in, we have no means of storing user-specific settings anyway)."
