   "Updated the SVN properties to ignore the target directories at each of the OpenJPA sub-project levels (openjpa-jdbc,", 
   "openjpa-jdbc-5, etc).  Some of the sub-projects already had the svn:ignore property for the target directory, but", 
   "not all of them.  I also updated the properties to ignore any \"dot files\" at the top most OpenJPA (ie. trunk)",
