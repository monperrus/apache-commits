   "rpc.js omnibus updates patch:", 
   "1. RMR, new transport for Safari < 4, Chrome < 2, and should work as a backup on", 
   "several other browsers (the latter claim requires more testing).", 
   "- Paves the way to sunsetting IFPC, in turn sunsetting the need for containers", 
   "to host \"active\" relay file rpc_relay.html and configure it properly.", 
   "2. Refactoring transport code into separate \"classes\". This cleans up the code a", 
   "bit and makes it possible to optimize later by emitting only the JS a given", 
   "browser needs rather than JS for all techniques.", 
   "3. Early-message queueing. Makes it possible to call gadgets.rpc.call(...) in a", 
   "container to a gadget before the gadget is initialized (or even rendered), with", 
   "the call still going through when the gadget is ready. It also ensures that G ->", 
   "C calls made before G -> C initialization is complete also succeed (this is much", 
   "less prevalent).", 
   "4. Various cleanups including tentative backward-setup support. As a convenience", 
   "and to prevent user error, makes it possible to call", 
   "gadgets.rpc.setAuthToken(gadget, token); before the gadget IFRAME is rendered.", 
   "While not recommended in any case, this is intended to make the library easier", 
   "to use.", 
   "All users should take care to ensure that both sides of any rpc.js connection", 
   "(container/child frame) use the same version. Without this, breakages may occur."
