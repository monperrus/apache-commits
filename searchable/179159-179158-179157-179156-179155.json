   "A major fix. When we had a sub-grammar (like LdapResult) into a grammar, and when this sub-grammar is following by", 
   "some other elements to parse, the decoder was simply not working. This has been fixed by adding a state stack to", 
   "store the current state before the switch, and some controls when we are coming back from a swicth to know when we", 
   "have to pursue the decoding on the current grammar or finishing it.", 
   "Quite complicated...", 
   "Fortunatly, this leads to some simplification in all the grammars, as we don't anymore have to deal with the", 
   "following states when leaving a sub-grammar."
