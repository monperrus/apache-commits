   "Added method TemplateManager.getTemplateResources() that returns a Map that resolves requests for -- wait for it -- template resources. This Map is injected into the HttpSession as the attribute 'templates'. That means that JSPs can now use EL expressions like this: ${templates['FindContent.jsp']}, which returns the relative path to the correct content JSP. The current template takes precedence, followed by the default template. The Map is initialized at wiki startup, so it is very efficient. In the future, wiki:IncludeTag will be refactored to use this Map."
