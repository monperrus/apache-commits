   "This patch makes the maven-release-plugin no longer specify the tagBase by default. It will now play nicely with the changes made to the maven-scm-provider-svn in SCM-72.", 
   "The other significant change is that I made the version resolution a little smarter. I was tired of it not understanding my 3 digit versions (1.1.1). It now understands quite a few different ways of specifying the version and should be able to generate the next version as well as a snapshot version string. While it is quite robust, I wrote it with the thought that others could implement the interface if they wanted to use their own versioning scheme. I have the ProjectVersionResolver.getResolvedVersion explicitly instantiating the DefaultVersionInfo class because I am not sure what the best pattern is to have the container handle it. If someone wanted to insert their own class for the impl, how could they go about configuring it to do so? I also had the VersionInfo object implement comparable even though it isn't used right now. I can think of a couple places that might come in handy."
