   "Applied patch from Bruno Busco in Jira #OFBIZ-2172 with basics for VisualThemeSet; still not possible to change themes in ecommerce (should probably be supported on the back end instead of the front end, ie in the catalog manager and not by a customer in ecommerce, or perhaps only allowed in ecommerce if a flag on the ProductStore says its okay; also does not yet filter selectable themes in the back-end/manager applications"
