   "To make RichText more lightweight, it now uses the same technique as RichEditableText2 for its TLF hostFormat. In particular, it uses an object which is not actually a TextLayoutFormat, but instead simply implements ITextLayoutFormat by pulling the format properties directly from the component's CSS styles using getStyle(). This object is now implemented in a new CSSTextLayoutFormat class. It is smaller because it has only one var (for the object to call getStyle() on) rather than a var for every format property.", 
   "Also, the code in SimpleText, RichText, and RichEditableText2 for handling embedded fonts is now more uniform; all three classes use an identical getEmbeddedFontContext() method, which can eventually be factored into a base class or utility class after we determine the constellation of text classes that we'll ship with. I also made this code more efficient by using only a static instance of EmbeddedFont and TextFormat.",
