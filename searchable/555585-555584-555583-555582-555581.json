   "added pluggable Language implementations and test cases, plus added some new Spring XML test cases. Added a simple language which is handy for testing; as it doesn't add any more dependencies and can be used in regular camel-core. Also added new XPath namespaces & helper functions for accessing headers/properties etc. Apologies for the large commit; it was a rather long flight :)"
