   "* Added new DataObjectFactory to take care of MO:DCA DataObject creation/instantiation.",

   "* Added Category and Type inner interfaces and handy copySF() to base AbstractAFPObject with more code reuse, simplifications/optimizations of writeStart() and writeEnd().", 
   "* SVG entry and isImage() isGraphic() convenience methods added to MO:DCA Registry.", 
   "* Updated AFPSVGHandler to use similar fox:conversion-mode foreign attribute mechanism for bitmap painting fallback used by PCLRenderer and PDFRenderer."
