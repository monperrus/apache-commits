   "* InputStream#read is not required to fill the buffer, even if the end of the stream has not yet been reached. If the number of bytes provided by the input stream is not a multiple of 3, this causes corruption of the Base64 encoding. Fixed the code to always fill the byte buffer entirely (except if the end of stream is reached). This solved WSCOMMONS-101.", 
   "* The code used InputStream#available in an incorrect way: available() == 0 doesn't mean that the end of the stream has been reached! Fixed the code so that the end of stream is detected correctly."
