   "Second commit of ReferenceManager. All unit tests now pass, although certain behaviors are slightly different than in the past. In particular, the WikiPaths passed to getReferredBy() and getRefersTo() are NOT resolved; they are assumed to be correct. This was an unnecessary optimization that, in practice, was not needed. Overall pass rate over 93%."
