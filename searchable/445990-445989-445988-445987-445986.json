   "This file never should have been removed.  Unfortunate that we put it into the client package as it has nothing to do with the remote client.  Course the other perspective is that it's unfortunate we put the EJBd client code into the org.openejb.client package as it's not generic client code and tied to that protocol specifically.  One thought is to move all protocol-specific client code into modules relating to the protocol (server) and make an actual client package consisting of a few classes only and providing an easy way to use the protocol of your choosing.",
