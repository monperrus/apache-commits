   "Made links look more like standard links:  default colour \"blue\", underlined (by showing the bottom border of the contents box), purplish if link has been clicked-on before in this page viewing---not sticky on refreshing, unfortunately.  The \"visited\" visual cue is done with a slight change to the bridge's onmousedown():  a style \"Visited\" is added to the styles for the box and contents.", 
   "While mouse-downed, a dotted grey box is drawn around the entire link (not just the text contents). The link also turns red, as in Mozilla browsers.", 
   "IE6/7 don't do the colour change, but the cue can't hurt---and if it does, it's easily changed in the stylesheet."
