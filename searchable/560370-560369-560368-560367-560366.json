   "a couple fixes for task scheduler.", 
   "1. the new scheduler expects the tasklock entry to exist in the db before running a task, so the initialization process for the thread manager has been updated such that all enabled tasks are checked for an a tasklock record and if it doesn't exist it is created.", 
   "2. added in a small amount of time adjustment to the scheduler so that it tries to reawaken each minute a small amount of time after the beginning of the first second rather than right at the zeroith millisecond.  this accounts for possible imprecisions in the way the sleep time is chosen."
