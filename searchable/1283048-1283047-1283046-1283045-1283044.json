   "TextBase no longer overrides validateBaselinePosition(). It was the only UIComponent to do so. Since the override didn't have the same logic as in UIComponent for the case where the component's actual width or height has not yet been calculated, it caused the baselinePosition of a Spark Label or RichText to be reported as 0 if you access it early.",

Hopefully when switching to Strobe we can cleanup this logic...I put a FIXME in to do this.",
