   "DERBY-688: Enhancements to XML functionality toward XPath/XQuery support", 
   "This patch was submitted by Army Brown (qozinx@gmail.com)", 
   "Attaching a \"phase 7\" patch, d688_phase7_v1.patch, that does the following:", 
   "1 - Makes changes to catch all \"Throwable\" errors that might be", 
   "thrown by Xalan or JAXP, instead of just catching the exceptions", 
   "declared by the APIs. This is per the email thread here:", 
   "http://www.nabble.com/xalan-assertion-when-execution-a-xml-query...-tf2149830.html#a5953476", 
   "This allows Derby to continue working as normal if/when an", 
   "unexpected Xalan/JAXP error (such NPE or assertion failure)", 
   "occurs. In that case the statement itself will fail and the", 
   "error will be printed, but Derby will continue to work as", 
   "expected after the failure.", 
   "2 - Slight change so that, in the event of an unexpected Xalan", 
   "compilation error, the name of the operator that encountered", 
   "the error will be printed as part of Derby's message. Currently", 
   "the operator name isn't passed in and thus \"{0}\" shows up", 
   "in the error message, which is incorrect.", 
   "3 - Fixes a small bug in XML query execution code that was leading", 
   "to NPEs in Xalan. Namely, the current code passes a null argument", 
   "into Xalan where a non-null is expected (and required) for namespace", 
   "prefix resolution.", 
   "4 - Makes the first of two changes required to ensure Derby SQL/XML", 
   "support agrees with the specification. The two changes are", 
   "mentioned in my previous comments; this phase 7 patch addresses", 
   "the first one (insertion of a non-Document node into a Derby XML", 
   "column should not be allowed)."
