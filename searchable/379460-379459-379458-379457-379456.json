   "WSM changes to remove the Jsr181ObjectModelStore and switch entirely to a plain-text XML file that describes a JSR-181 annotated web service.  This change also removes the Axis 1.2 JARs which were still committed to the tree; this required changing a bunch of build files that referenced the old directory.", 
   "The switch off of .ser files means that there should be a .xml file for every annotated web service.  The ServiceDescriptionFactory has been changed to do as much manual wire-up of Axis 1.x objects as possible -- less is automatically done by the Axis JavaServiceDesc class.",
