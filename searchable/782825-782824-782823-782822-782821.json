   "Rewrite of osapi to factor out the RPC transport mechanism and support a", 
   "gadgets.rpc based transport in addition to the json-rpc one. This is a pretty", 
   "extensive rewrite but hopefully the code is a little simpler and more extensible", 
   "now. It should be fairly trivial to add a REST transport instead of the json-rpc", 
   "one for instance.", 
   "There is now a container-side osapi.js which container can be used as a basis for", 
   "exposing additional osapi services using the new gadgets.rpc transport. See", 
   "/javascript/container/osapi.js.", 
   "To enable this feature in your container config you can either have the set of", 
   "services introspected at gadget render-time using", 
   "{ \"gadget.features\" ...", 
   "{ \"osapi.services\" :", 
   "{\"gadgets.rpc\" : [\"container.listMethods\"]}", 
   "}", 
   "}", 
   "or if you want to avoid introspection and just list out the container methods to", 
   "expose and exclude \"container.listMethods\". E.g.", 
   "{ \"gadget.features\" ...", 
   "{ \"osapi.services\" :", 
   "{\"gadgets.rpc\" :", 
   "[\"requestShareApp\", \"requestPermission\", ...]}", 
   "}", 
   "}", 
   "In your container to expose new methods to gadgets simply bind them to the osapi namespace.",

   "osapi.newservice = {};", 
   "osapi.newservice.do = function (request, callback) {", 
   "callback(<data>);", 
   "}", 
   "will expose osapi.newservice.do inside any gadget on the page if introspection", 
   "is enabled, if introspection is disabled it needs to be added to the container", 
   "config.", 
   "The samplecontainer is updated to support introspection", 
   "In addition the container config now supports declaring the set of available", 
   "methods for a json-rpc endpoint directly too so that Shindig doesnt have to call", 
   "system.listMethods against each endpoint. Instead you can directly add", 
   "{ \"gadget.features\" ...", 
   "{ \"osapi.services\" :", 
   "{\"http://%host%/social/rpc\" :", 
   "[\"people.get\", \"activities.get\", ...]}", 
   "}", 
   "}", 
   "Other minor changes..", 
   "- makeNonProxiedRequest now returns error \"rc\" and \"text\" fields", 
   "- osapi introspection over gadgets.rpc can delay the gadget onload callback by", 
   "a max of 300ms.", 
   "- osapi.ui is removed. The sample container exposes \"activities.requestCreate\",", 
   "\"messages.requestSend\", \"requestShareApp\", \"requestPermission\" as examples only.", 
   "This is subject to change as these are not standardized", 
   "Thanks to Sachin Senoy for his initial work on the gadgets.rpc transport."
