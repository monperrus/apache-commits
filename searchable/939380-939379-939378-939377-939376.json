   "o The lookup operation now returns an Entry instead of a ClonedServerEntry", 
   "o Renamed Entry inner class to Element inside the InterceptorChain, to avoid a name collision with the Entry class", 
   "o The Exception interceptor does not anymore check that the entry exist before returning it : if the entry does not exist, then we will get a null value, and will generate the appropriate exception. We then save a call to the hasEntry() operation", 
   "o Added some missing Javadoc"
