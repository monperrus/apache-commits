   "Added support for viewing both debug and optimized versions of static javascript.", 
   "By default, JsServlet and GadgetRenderingServlet will return optimized content, but this can now be set to return unmodified versions of scripts by passing debug=1 in the query string.", 
   "Additionally, all other static resources will be produced in duplicate; file.opt.js will be the optimized version of a file, and file.js will be the normal, debug version. This means that all sample pages (files served from files/) will revert to serving \"debug\" code by default, and you must conciously choose to use the optimized version for these pages, or when doing your own deployment."
