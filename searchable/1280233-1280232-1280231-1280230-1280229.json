   "Oodles of RET Bugs.  The general theme behind these changes is that we are no longer using the last layout width as the bounds for measurement any more unless explicitWidth or widthInChars is set.  That is required in order to allow the RET to resize as other factors affect its size, but can cause more invalidation in scenarios where the RET's width is not \"fixed\".  If the extra invalidations prove to be an issue, we will resolve that in a different way.",
