  "msg": [
   "-) Fixes TAPESTRY-1309 by changing the function logic to iterate over the current form profile specified fields to clear decoration error classes instead of just iterating over all form elements.", 
   "-) Fixed regression exception reported on users list but not filed in jira having to do with failing to correctly load i18n resources for dojo client side validation  / localized widgets.", 
   "-) Re-did the numeric client side validation contribution logic to use the new dojo.i18n.number API for better handling of i18n validation logic. Also corrected a few issues with various country formats that existed in the old system so this new change should prove much better for all locales.", 
   "-) Re-built the dojo 0.4.2 distribution as my previous attempt got messed up somehow and the i18n stuff wasn't able to resolve things correctly."
