   "River-26 Changed the behaviour of ConcurrentPermissions to prevent the Enumeration<Permission> returned by elements() from throwing a ConcurrentModificationException, while the underlying associated PermissionCollection is being modified.  This behaviour was changed to enable UmbrellaGrant's to be added to DynamicConcurrentPolicyProvider.  GrantPermission's PermissionCollection had to be changed to not add duplicate GrantPermission's, this was part of the UmbrellaGrantPermission addition.", 
   "MultiReadPermissionCollection was changed to incorporate an elements cache to prevent the underlying PermissionCollection causing the Enumerator from throwing the ConcurrentModificationException when add was called concurrently.", 
   "MergedPolicyProvider had synchronization removed, the synchronization was added temporarily to assist in solving some earlier implementation concurrency bugs."
