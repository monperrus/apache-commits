   "1. Implementation of RMR, a new transport for all browsers currently using IFPC (notably Chrome < 2 and Safari < 4). This transport requires no active relay, instead constructing one from the receiver's protocol://host:port + robots.txt. See code and SHINDIG-1050, which this resolves, for details.", 
   "2. Improvements to rpctest harness for testing rpc functionality.", 
   "3. Removing window['console']['log'] hooks in favor of standard gadgets.log functions.", 
   "4. Improving sameDomain transport code to do string matching rather than using exception handling for control flow."
