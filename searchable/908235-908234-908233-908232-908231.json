   "This patch adds the Printable interface and unifies ClusterBase, Model and DirichletCluster as implementors. I did not extend this to Vector or Matrix, though that is possible, preferring to write a simple vector formatter in ClusterBase which is used by all implementations.", 
   "Added back the JsonModelAdapter and JsonClusterAdapter which I removed recently because they were unused. Adding back Json formatting to the Dirichlet clustering required their reinstatement.", 
   "Added TestPrintableInterface which tests the new implementations. All other tests continue to run.", 
   "TODO: need to modify ClusterDumper to complete this issue but, as it has users who may want some time to review the new code, I will hold off for a few days."
