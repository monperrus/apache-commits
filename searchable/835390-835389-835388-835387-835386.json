   "Added automated conformance testing for W3C Widgets: Packaging and Configuration; this implements 100 of the 147 tests developed by the W3C team (another 47 are placeholders that require further work). Note that I've made a small change to the upload results page to make it easier to collect error messages. (Thanks to Marcos Caceres for the encouragement!)"
