   "Upgraded the OMElementImpl.clone method to (a) read optimized xop:includes from the source and (b) use a xop aware builder to create the target tree.  This effectively retains the content-id and datahandler information of the original tree.", 
   "Other changes (XOPBuilder, etc) are minor additions or debug changes to support the new clone implementation.", 
   "I also added two validation tests (in MTOMStAXSOAPModelBuilderTest)."
