   "[MNG-2228] better fix for this problem - put extensions in a child container. This guarantees separation avoiding root classloader pollution that was causing plugins such as the release plugin to fail when using wagon-webdav.", 
   "NOTE: this is not 100% backwards compatible. Should anyone have been relying on looking up build extensions from the root container it will no longer work. Such code would now need to search the \"extensions\" child container. While theoretically possible, neither are recommended (or \"documented\" practices) - plugins should be utilising plugin depedencies and the plugin classpath. Build extensions are for Maven core classes (ie, wagons at this point)"
