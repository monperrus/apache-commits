   "Store checksums for all files written and verify them on read.  CRCs are stored for every 512 bytes of data, so that randomly accessed data may be verified.  Errors are reported to the filesystem implementation.  Local file errors cause files to be moved to a bad file directory, so that bad disk areas are not reused.  NDFS file errors should cause blocks to be moved to a bad block directory on the datanode, forcing the use of replicas of the bad blocks with no loss of data.  This is not yet implemented for NDFS."
