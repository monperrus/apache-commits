   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ROL-1918", 
   "- Change to exception handling so errors get logged", 
   "- Better handling for files in root directory", 
   "It is possible that you'll get a 500 error if a weblog does not have a root media directory. As far as I know, the only way that can happen is if you upgrade from 4.0 to 5.0 but do not do the media file migration properly."
