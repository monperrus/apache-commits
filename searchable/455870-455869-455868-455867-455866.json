   "The getResource() method in Image now uses the new findParentWithAssociatedMarkup() method to find the nearest parent with associated markup, which it then uses as the base class for image loading.  This should always be right for Images since they are referenced from markup and findParentWithAssociatedMarkup() should always find that markup."

   "Added ResourceComponent base class for components that provide resources by iimplementing IResourceListener.  There doesn't appear to be an easy way to generalize this to Pages since they inherit from Component and since their behavior is quite different.  Also changed IResource.getExtension() to getContentType() and changed the implementation of this interface in Resource to use the JDK's FileNameMap class to map from filenames to mime types."
