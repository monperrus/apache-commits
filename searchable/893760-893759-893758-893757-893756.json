   "committed David Jencks' patch for MYFACES-2290", 
   "=> Geronimo integration of myfaces 2 cannot proceed without this patch.", 
   "The attached patch changes the osgi metadata installed by the maven-bundle-plugin so that myfaces can be used with osgi bundles with normal package versioning for javaee6, mostly allowing use of a servlet 3.0 spec jar. Note that this does not affect the ability to use myfaces 2 with earlier spec jars, it only allows myfaces to be used in ee6 containers that run under osgi.", 
   "Thanks to David Jencks for the patch!"
