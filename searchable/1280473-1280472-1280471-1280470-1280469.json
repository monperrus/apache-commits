   "Add UIComponent.mapKeycodeForLayoutDirection().  This should be called by any keyDownHandlers() which handles Keyboard.LEFT and Keyboard.RIGHT, and optionally for Keyboard.UP and Keyboard.DOWN, if they behave like Keyboard.LEFT and Keyboard.RIGHT.  If the layoutDirection=\"rtl\", it maps LEFT to RIGHT, RIGHT to LEFT, UP to RIGHT and DOWN to LEFT.  This allows the keyDownHandler() to perform the correct action without adding lots of special case code to the key handling code.",
