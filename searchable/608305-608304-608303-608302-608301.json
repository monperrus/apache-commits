   "Adding Gadgets API JavaScript, including inter-domain communication library (IFPC) to Shindig. Also, adding initial support for type=URL gadgets, along with several cleanups, tweaks, and bugfixes.", 
   "Details:", 
   "* IFPC (Inter-frame procedure call) library, enabling container-to-gadget and gadget-to-container communication.", 
   "* Library declared in the namespace \"gadgets.*\".", 
   "* Backward compatibility maintained with iGoogle with the messaging protocol unchanged and an _IFPC alias defined in the global namespace.", 
   "* Base gadgets core JS functionality", 
   "* IO routines (eg. fetchContent APIs)", 
   "* User pref and localization message handling", 
   "* Backward-compatibility layer to ensure interoperability w/ existing gadgets.", 
   "* Fixed incorrect dependency handling in GadgetFeatureRegistry.", 
   "* Added support for loading all core JS from default locations (Configurability TBD)", 
   "* Adding initial type=URL gadget support.", 
   "* Works by constructing URL and redirecting to it.", 
   "* UserPrefs special-cased as up_<foo> arguments for now; to be generalized soon.", 
   "* Renamed BasicGadgetHttpServlet to GadgetRenderingServlet.", 
   "* Augmented JsLibrary with registration mechanism to allow references to JavaScript", 
   "libraries that implement various features by short name.", 
   "* Added JsServlet for serving JavaScript files registered as above.", 
   "+ Includes support for loading _all_ libs at once with no changes by Gadget developers.", 
   "Technique: libs=js/foo:bar:baz.js turned into <script src=\"gadget.com/gadgets/js/foo:bar:baz.js\"/>,", 
   "which in turn serves a single consolidated JS file from components foo.js, bar.js, baz.js,", 
   "in order.", 
   "* URL -> URI", 
   "* Used throughout almost all of the code (except RemoteContentFetcher - TBD)", 
   "* Cleanups and Tweaks", 
   "* Registering AnalyticsFeature in its own class.", 
   "* Returning SC_BAD_REQUEST in a few relevant places in the rendering servlet.", 
   "* Cleaned up some MessageBundle naming-related issues by renaming GadgetSpec.MessageBundle to GadgetSpec.LocaleSpec (Locale is taken already).", 
   "* Created Check static class to perform argument/state checking.", 
   "* ParsedGadgetSpec enforces correct content-type in getContentHref/Data().", 
   "* Switched to JUnit 4.4.", 
   "* Added Hamcrest matching package 1.1.",
