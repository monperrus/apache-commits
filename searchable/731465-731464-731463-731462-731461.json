   "Moving to a structure where the index.html is in the top of the site, but nothing else. Then the rest of the site is in site/. It seems you have to specify full urls for the auto-thinking to happen, so sadly doing that. They don't really get used but become a smart component specific web-root. Also playing with pom variables by trying to have a section that changes for each component to show standard reports. Unlikely to work in that I don't think I can turn it off in the parent."
