   "After the video player goes in to full screen mode, text styles no longer inherit properly. This is because in the skin, we set color.fullScreenStates=\"white\".  When leaving fullScreen state, the states code sets fullScreen state explicitly back to what it was--no longer allowing for the style to inherit.  To fix this, I explicitly set color back to undefined.  I also filed another bug about how states/styles should be smarter about calling setStyle() and should only do it on inline styles.", 
   "I'm also cleaning up some dead styles in the wireframe VideoPlayerSkin.", 
   "I'm also fixing an AIR bug I found when on a Mac (it's Mac-only) when going exiting fullscreen mode because AIR reports the nativeWindow isn't visible when leaving fullscreen mode.  This was causing the video playback to stop when pauseWhenHidden = true.",

Also fixing a bug caught during the last code review where you would set the volume on the VideoPlayer, but the volumeBar wouldn't be made aware of that change.", 
   "Switching out the video component results in *many* API changes.  The changes are highlighted below:",

   "- spark.components.mediaClasses.StreamingVideoSource is renamed to park.components.mediaClasses.DynamicStreamingVideoSource", 
   "- spark.components.mediaClasses.StreamItem is renamed to park.components.mediaClasses.DynamicStreamingVideoItem",

   "- playheadTime:Number has been renamed to currentTime:Number", 
   "- playWhenHidden has been renamed to pauseWhenHidden, and it's \"tense\" has been reversed.  So playWhenHidden = true correlates to pauseWhenHidden = false.

   "- seekToFirstFrame:Boolean (pending PARB approval) - This is a new property available on VideoDisplay/VideoPlayer.  When autoPlay = false, if seekToFirstFrame is set to true, then we will connect to the server to start downloading the video, figure out the size of the video and resize appropriately, and show the first frame of the video.  If seekToFirstFrame is false, then no connection to the server is made, there's no implicit size for this video, and the first frame will not be show automatically.  By default the value of this property is true.  In the old video component, when autoPlay = false, we always has the same behavior as seekToFirstFrame = true.  Now it is controllable through this property.  Eventually, (not for Flex 4.0), we will most-likely have support for a thumbnail source or a splash screen so the video's preview will show up without making an unneeded connection to the server.  The property name may change depending on PARB.",
