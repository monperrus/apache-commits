   "o When url.openStream() is used to read an individual file from an archive i.e. when protocol is \"jar\", the archive file is locked even after the stream is closed and it prevents immediate deletion of temporary files created during the deployment process.  This can be avoided by using JarFile.getInputStream() instead."
