   "Several Improvements to the KeywordLinkingEngine", 
   "* Type Mappings are now configureable (implementation of STANBOL-536)", 
   "* Added an OpenNLP Tokenizer implementation that is optimized for matching Keywords. The use of this Tokenizer can be forced by an option of the KeywordLinkingEngine (implementation of STANBOL-538)", 
   "* The KeywordLinkingEngine now supports case sensitive matching (implementation of STANBOL-535). This required also changes to the SolrYard as up to now parsed queries where converted to lower case because wild case queries are not processed by the query analyzer. Now the SolrYard only converts Query string for wildcard queries to lower case. This special treatment can be removed with the release of Solr 3.6 because than it will be supported that also wildcard queries are converted to lowercase if the schema.xml is configured accordingly", 
   "other changes:", 
   "* The Stanbol Enhancer Web UI uses now separate categories for any dc:type value found for TextAnnotations.", 
   "* Added the following Namespaces to the NamespaceEnum of the Entityhub",
