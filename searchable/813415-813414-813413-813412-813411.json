   "The method is also used to clean the code related to the two existing marketing package types (that have now in common the same parent).", 
   "This will make the framework more flexible because you will be able to create a new product subtype and the system will treat them as its parent type; then you can add custom code to treat it in the special way (if needed). This pattern can be extended in other areas of the system, starting from product types (right now it is also applied to marketing packages).",
