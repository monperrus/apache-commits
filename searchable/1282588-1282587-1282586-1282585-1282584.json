   "Workaround for player issue. The bounds used internally by the player do not match the bounds returned from getBounds(), so it is tough to create a bitmap snapshot of a component that has the same location/bounds as the player would use. This makes it problematic to use bitmaps with ShaderFilter to substitute for the real object, and causes some objects to shift during the effects (Wipe, CrossFade, AnimateTransitionShader). This is particularly true for objects with filtered children (where the filters run outside the bounds of the parent) and objects with text areas that border the left/top of the component. The workaround is to draw the object into a bitmap with an opaque background and measure the resulting colored pixels with BitmapData.getColorBoundsRect() to get the true bounds as seen by the player.",
