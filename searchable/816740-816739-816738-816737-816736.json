   "Removed the direct dependency on jaxen. axis2-jaxws doesn't use Jaxen and the dependency introduces several unwanted transitive dependencies (such as dom4j, jdom and XOM). This also makes sure that xercesImpl is no longer included in the distribution: it should not be necessary to ship Xerces because Axis2 now requires Java 1.5."
