   "Applied patch from jira issue OFBIZ-2470 (In Cross-Ship Replacement we need to make sure return for refund is possible after a return for replacement)", 
   "This patch covers following scenarios:", 
   "1) Refund of the replacement order possible now. Since the replacement order has no payment preferences associated to it, payment preferences of the original order are used to process the refund. When the replacement order refund is complete you can look for the related entry in payment information section of the original order. Also you can find the payments for this return in ReturnItem screen.", 
   "2) When a replacement order is cancelled, and replacement return against which it was created is already received, then that return is refunded.", 
   "Thanks Mridul, Arun for your contribution."
