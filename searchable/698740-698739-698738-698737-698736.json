   "[MASSEMBLY-190] Pre-collect dependencies that will need to be resolve for one or more dependencySets/moduleSets in the assembly, then use the versions from this pre-collection activity in the form of a managed-version map, with one exception: the versions will be imposed on direct dependencies as well.", 
   "Also, separated ${module.*} expressions from ${artifact.*} expressions, so that in a moduleSet/binaries section, <outputDirectory>${module.artifactId}</outputDirectory can remain constant for a given module project, while <outputFileNameMapping>${artifact.artifactId}.${artifact.extension}</outputFileNameMapping> can vary according to the module-dependency artifact being processed.", 
   "In addition, I'm adding unit tests for the DefaultDependencyResolver methods (other than resolveDependencies(..), which will require more involved mock-ups), and an integration test to verify that MASSEMBLY-190 is fixed."
