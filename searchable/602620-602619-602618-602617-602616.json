   "[SUREFIRE-347] [SUREFIRE-334] Made a plexus conflict integration test to confirm these bugs.  SUREFIRE-334 reproduced, SUREFIRE-347 didn't (though it is filed against 2.3).  Resolved by shading surefire-booter and surefire-api deps (just commons-lang and plexus-utils, now that we no longer depend on plexus-archiver).  Will also need to port this to 2.3 branch."
