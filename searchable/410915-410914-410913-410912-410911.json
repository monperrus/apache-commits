   "Contributed by Myrna van Lunteren", 
   "Attached is patch tests_20060531.diff (and stat) for the trunk, which removes some failures in derbyall runs with less commonly tested jvms by making a number of minor changes:", 
   "- after the fix for DERBY-577 all .java tests that use ext*", 
   "directories failed with the 'j9' jvms (wsdd5.6, wctme5.7,", 
   "wctme5.7_foundation - i.e. all jvms which have executable 'j9' instead of java). When I first started working with those jvms it seemed that those jvms decided another directory was user.dir, and the only solution I could see at the time was to add a section changing the directory. Removing the setting of user.dir made all jvms work the same way, so this if block had to come out, but I had forgotten...(change to RunTest.java that can only possibly affect j9 runs)", 
   "- because the j9 jvms do not run with security manager, the output of the test RunClassPathTester.java cannot be made stable. Adding RunClassPathTester_app.properties to skip the test with those jvms.",
