   "This backport does not have any mergeinfo associated with it.", 
   "The changes were made on trunk in several revisions, so it was easier", 
   "to just copy the current trunk code over and tweak it into shape instead", 
   "of merging individual revisions. For this reason, I've written a new log",

   "On Windows systems, it uses a custom implementation that works much like",

   "within the filename.", 
   "(svn_io_open_unique_file3): Instead of calling svn_io_open_uniquely_named(),", 
   "use temp_file_create().", 
   "(file_perms_set2): New helper. On trunk, this function has a sibling called", 
   "file_perms_set() which we don't need here.", 
   "(get_default_file_perms): Create a temporary file inside the function", 
   "instead of opening a file at a path provided by the caller.", 
   "As a performance optimisation, cache the default file permissions in", 
   "a static variable upon the first call. Subsequent calls will not go", 
   "to disk but return the cached value.", 
   "(merge_default_file_perms): New helper.", 
   "(io_set_file_perms): Don't overwrite existing permission bits when making",
