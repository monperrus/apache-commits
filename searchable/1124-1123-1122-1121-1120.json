   "Have just checked out the ldap server package and started browsing around.  One thing I noticed that you may want to correct is the <shortDescription> tag usage in you project.xml files.  Under Maven 10 the short description is used as single-line field in auto-generated manifests.  However, the jar plugin does not do any validation of the value.  This means that something like:",
