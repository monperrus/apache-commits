   "Fix variableRowHeight support in GridDimensions and other various bugs. These changes also fix Grid to follow the correct measure rules such as rowHeight having a real effect on the typical row height.", 
   "Grid.as - The rowHeight is now backed by GridDimensions.defaultRowHeight now. Moved some clearing code down to commitProperties.", 
   "GridDimensions.as - Removed fixedRowHeight. Instead, we use a variableRowHeight Boolean that reflects the Grid\u2019s value. The defaultRowHeight returns Grid\u2019s rowHeight if rowHeight is explicitly set. If rowHeight isn\u2019t set, defaultRowHeight returns the maximum typical cell height. defaultRowHeight also defaults to NaN now instead of 26.", 
   "GridLayout.as - Fixed an RTE from getItemRendererAt() in the case that bounds is null. Removed some excess code.", 
   "GridColumn.as - Fixed an edge case which was causing an RTE where someone sets the dataField to null.",

   "Fix for handling columns (IList) changes in GridDimensions. I implemented the columnsCollectionChanged handler in GridDimensions to handle all the collection events.", 
   "GridDimensions.as - When someone sets the columnCount, we should clear everything. Implemented columnsCollectionChanged(). Changed typicalCellWidths and typicalCellHeights to Vectors to make them easier to handle. Added a few helper functions to insert multiple values into vectors and to clear a vector. Also, fixed a small bug in getColumnIndexAt for the case where the column width is 0. Fixed up the rowCount setter to remove the excess rows.",

   "Grid layers are now defined as type GridLayer (a private class), instead of Group.", 
   "GridLayer type no longer extends Group, it's now an object that has Group valued root property.   This makes the type's API relatively tiny - only two methods - and makes it possible for GridLayer to encapsulate the Grid itself as a layer (the item renderer layer).",

   "Support for the module implications of embedded fonts is now GridColumn's responsiblity.  GridColumn/itemToRenderer() now wraps item renderer ClassFactory item renders with a local ClassFactory subclass that delegates the newInstance() operation to the grid's moduleFactory.",
