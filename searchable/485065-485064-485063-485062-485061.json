   "1. removed table-layout fixed from button", 
   "2. removed the 1px depression look - changed the size of the button on IE (and mozilla if table-layout fixed was not set)", 
   "3. changed the background image start for both buttons and headers to be bottom", 
   "4. moved the header bottom line from the stylesheet into the image - this fixed some problems getting the line consistent across both the active headers and the header background", 
   "5. Added an application class, moved font and other body changes there", 
   "6. Add font and text inherit styles to table so that panels will inherit font settings"
