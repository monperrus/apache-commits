   "Rename of flex -> mx.", 
   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",

   "This is a collection of minor component changes, done for consistency.",

   "* Button (and every subclass) has an optional \"labelField\" SkinPart. The Button \"label\" property is pushed into this part if it is defined.", 
   "* Added skin states to the following components:", 
   "TrackBase (includes H/VScrollBar and H/VSlider): States \"normal\" and \"disabled\".",

   "ContainerBase (includes ItemsComponent, Selector, and List): States \"normal\" and \"disabled\".", 
   "The appearance of \"disabled\" states is controlled by the skin. The behavior of \"disabled\" states is still controlled by the component (ie ScrollBar disables the thumb, track and arrow when it is disabled).", 
   "* Added new ContainerBase class, which is the base class for ItemsComponent and DataComponent. The base class manages the skin states and puts up a mouse shield when disabled.", 
   "* Thumb positioning code in slider and scrollbar always rounds to the nearest pixel boundary. Sub-pixel positioning makes the thumbs look blurry.", 
   "* TextView measurement is rounded to integer values. It was commonly returning non-integer values which was causing subsequent components in relative layouts to be positioned on sub-pixel boundaries.",
