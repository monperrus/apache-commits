   "This reverts r736810. In my testing (admittedly limited) I did not observe any benefot from the optimisation. It causes a bug where concurrent calls to the non-const getBody() method can result in the encodedSize() method returning 0. This has implications e.g. for store modules where the message size may be incorrectly reported resulting in buffer overruns."
