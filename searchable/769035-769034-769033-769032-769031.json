   "Made several improvements to Windows_mod.pm after testing. Reworked image capture/load process. It now adds a Run registry key to call post_load.cmd after an image is loaded and Windows boots for the first time. This replaces the group policy scripts.ini manipulation which was problematic. Renamed delete_filesystem_entry() to delete_file() and fixed some bugs in it. Added move_file() and a few other utility subroutines."
