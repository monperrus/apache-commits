   "Web unit tests refactored (yet again) to use an embedded Jetty server. This replaces the need to use a separate Tomcat server, and *should* always work without any configuration of any kind. Please tests this via the Ant 'webtests' target! Note that this checkin introduces the TestContainer class, which with a little modification (later, please!) could easily be used as a stand-alone server. Refactorings are welcome; in the meantime, TestContainer should be considered volatile. Note also that the Rename Profile web unit tests for the container scenarios currently fails; all others run successfully."
