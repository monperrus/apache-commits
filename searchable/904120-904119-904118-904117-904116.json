   "Moved code which applies Windows security templates to earlier in the Windows.pm::pre_capture() subroutine. This allows registry permission changes made by the security templates to occur before other actions happen which require the permissions. The code to disable Security Center notifications and to set the desktop \"My Computer\" icon name require registry permissions to be opened up before they are attempted.", 
   "Updated Windows.pm::delete_scheduled_task() subroutine to check for \"cannot find the file specified\" in the schtasks.exe output. Windows 7 displays this message instead of \"task does not exist\" when attempting to delete a task which doesn't exist.", 
   "Added calls to set_device_path_key() in prepare_post_load() and prepare_newsid(). This allows the DevicePath registry setting to be set if Sysprep isn't used, allowing the computer to find the driver files copied during image capture."
