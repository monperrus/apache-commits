   "In the past when the width (or maxWidth) wasn\u2019t specified we told TLF that the width was our default maxWidth=10000.  This had implications especially when the text was rtl or textAlign != left because it aligned over a width of 10000. With this change we let TLF measure.  It will figure out the widest line and use that for the width.  Text will be aligned on that width.  So if there is only one line, and no explicit width, left, center and right alignment all look the same.", 
   "Truncation results will be slightly different now if there isn\u2019t an explicit width.  We will let TLF measure the width and it will use that width for the truncation.  Depending on whether the last line is the widest line or not, it may have to remove some of the text to make room for the truncation indicator.",
