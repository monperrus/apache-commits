   "Remove unneeded line from the method that normalizes decodedURI.", 
   "The line \"uriBC.setBytes(b, start, end);\" is wrong, as it should have been \"uriBC.setBytes(b, start, end - start);\". I suppose that it worked because in the only place that calls this normalize() method the value of 'start' was always equal to zero.", 
   "Instead of fixing, I am removing that line, because it actually is not needed there at all, thanks to the uriBC.setEnd() calls above it."
