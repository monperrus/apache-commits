   "Reworked conversion code to deal with the fact that the java.text Format parsing parses /leading/ values and not complete values.  In other words, it sees 10foo and parses and Integer without throwing an Exception.  The resulting code is smaller, more efficient (since it doesn't rely on exceptions to signal bad parses) and better structured.  Also changed the ConversionException class so that it stores the Format used for the conversion instead of just a String 'pattern'."
