   "Yesterday, late and in a hurry, I hastily committed r1212673. It was failing after an ant clean. But I did not see, because I did not do an ant clean, and Builbot did not report any issues (yes, I sometimes rely on it). Actually it was because Buildbot tests fails since r1212266, and it only sends info when it switches from bad to good, or vice-versa.",
