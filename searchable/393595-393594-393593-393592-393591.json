   "Fix a NetUI deadlock problem that can occur very occasionally when the accept changes and ensure failover steps of the DeferredSessionStorageHandler are interleaved by two threads.  This problem is tracked in BEEHIVE-1099 and discussed in this thread:",

   "The problem basically occurs when Thread1 sets A.jpf in the session during accept changes, Thread2 overwrites it with B.jpf during accept changes, and Thread1 then re-sets A.jpf in the session causing the Page Flow \"destroy\" lifecycle method to run on B.jpf.  This \"destroy\" call does not synchronize on B.jpf and can result in deadlock with another thread interacting with the same JPF.",
