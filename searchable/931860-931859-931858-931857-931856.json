   "Previously, java.beans.XMLEncoder has a field \"idSerialNo=0\" to generate ID for referred (refCount > 1) object. No matter what type of object it is, its ID is suffixed with a number counted based on the single idSerialNo field. But according to the enclosed test case, different classes should have separate number counter. This patch fix this problem and add a test case for recreation."
