   "Fixed a problem reported for WOOKIE-116 reported by Aaron Duley, whereby a formdata request results in an illegal state (STREAMED) error. This is caused by accessing parameters (which calls an InputStream) and a Reader to read content on the same request/response. I've changed the \"sendXMLData\" code and added more test cases to check behaviour. I've also made parts of the proxy code return more meaningful exception types to make debugging easier."
