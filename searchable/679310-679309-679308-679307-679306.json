   "added the patch for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-78 to implement a WriteLock high level protocol; though this patch has been modified to fit into the maven directory structure and it creates a separate zookeeper-protocols.jar which contains the higher level protocol and utilities including ZooKeeperFacade for dealing with reconnections with new sessions if a session expires and ProtocolSupport for retrying operations or blocks of synchronous code when there is a connection failure or session timeout exception"
