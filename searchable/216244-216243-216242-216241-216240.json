   "Implement type handling correctly in the service control.  After switching the web service object model off of java.lang.Class and onto java.lang.String, there was work needed in the web service control.", 
   "Note, the HackUtils is aptly named -- there is some currently nasty code that is used to map from String type name -> readable type name (for use during code generation) and from String type name -> Java class (for use during ServiceControl invocations).  This needs to be *fixed*, but it's sufficient to get the DRTs passing and to prove that all of this works.  The next step would be to provide a type abstraction that can be created from a java.lang.class or from a Mirror TypeDeclaration that provides the information about the type, it's array-ness, component type, etc.", 
   "But, the WSM and service control DRTs all run now.",
