   "Fix for BEEHIVE-1068.  This change alters the behavior of the method that looks up a \"global/Global.class\" object for back-compat.  If the check fails once, a ServletContext attribute is set in FlowControllerFactory that prevents the lookup from running again.  This short-circuits the logic that throws a ClassNotFoundException twice on a simple JPF -> JSP request.",
