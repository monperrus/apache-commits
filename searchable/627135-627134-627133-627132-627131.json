   "DERBY-1387 (partial) Establish a pattern of registering a Derby mbean using StandardMBean. This allows the MBean interface and implementation class to be in separate packages (and if required have unrelated names). This means the public api org.apache.derby.mbeans is not forced to contain the implementation of the MBeans and thus have references to other classes that are not part of the public api.",
