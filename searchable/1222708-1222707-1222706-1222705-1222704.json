   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3646 - Allow KahaDB to run without disk syncs, higher through put without the jms persistence guarantee. Allow 0 peroid to disable checkpoint/cleanup. Allow jmx gc operation to invoke cleanup so that store gc can be initiated via jms to ensure disk is reclaimed. Ensure periodic checkpoint does not sync when enableJournalDiskSyncs=false, it waits for completion but does not force to disk. fix cached buffer allocation and refactor to reuse more code in CallerBufferingDataFileAppender"
