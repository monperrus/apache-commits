   "Refactored the download pages. Now only mirrored releases are shown on the front line page. Also, every link goes directly to a release rather than a directory. The reason for this change is that people were going for the main distribtion site rather than the mirrors. This way, there are no instructions about the main site and hopefully people will be more likely to use the mirrors."
