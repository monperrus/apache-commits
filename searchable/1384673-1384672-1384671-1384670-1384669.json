   "[0.89-fb] [HBASE-6680]  Fix split log worker names", 
   "Author: aaiyer", 
   "Summary:", 
   "SplitLogWorker is using a human readable worker name that contains", 
   "space to identify itself to SplitLogManager.", 
   "eg:", 
   "<machine name> Worker #X.", 
   "SplitLogWorker uses <machine name>-worker-#number as its temporary directory.", 
   "While this is guaranteed to be unique, it appears that SplitLogManager tries", 
   "to discover the same directory using the \"worker name\" given by", 
   "SplitLogWorker. This is required to move the split recovered edits files to", 
   "the appropriate place.", 
   "Making both the names same, so that SplitLogManager can discover the", 
   "directory correctly.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "deploy to test cluster.", 
   "kill a rs.", 
   "ensure that the split log manager discovers the destination correctly, and", 
   "moves the split files.",
