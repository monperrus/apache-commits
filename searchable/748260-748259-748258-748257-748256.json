   "resolve broker unit test testReceiveTwoThenCloseConnection(org.apache.activemq.ra.JmsXAQueueTransactionTest): ra test uses Auto ack mode but the xa tx has been cleaned up so amq just sees a close on auto ack so it delivers the ack. AMQ-2128  Keeping the tx around till after the close sorts this out. One question though, with the ack mode supposed to be ignored, does it makes sense for the RA to use a transacted ack mode when there is a transaction?"
