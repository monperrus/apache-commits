   "The OtherFaultException test produced different outputs when run against different servers.  Sometimes the tags have namespaces and sometimes they don't.  The first attempt to standardise this was to change all namespaces to p717.  But, of course, when there where no namespaces, this still produced the incorrect result (because the expected output was different).  So, now I have removed all references to namespaces and changed the expected output file to match."
