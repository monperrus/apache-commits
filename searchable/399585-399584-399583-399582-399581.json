   "fox:disable-clipping on the i-f-o or e-g can be used to perform more painting operations natively in the HP GL/2 space. Since HP GL/2 provides only limited clipping functionality (which is not supported, yet) and the PCLGraphics2D fails with an UnsupportedException if it encounters an unsupported painting operation, every SVG graphic ends up being painted as a bitmap. This setting can help avoid that. Of course, I have yet to implement the IW (InputWindow, used for rectangular clipping) command."
