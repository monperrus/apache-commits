   "Applied patch to use HttpServletRequest attributes in place of HttpSession attributes when passing data from servlets to JSP rendering implementations. Note that errors and messages now utilize both attribute scopes depending on the source: request errors and messages appear in request attributes and FlashMessage errors and messages are stored in the session. See related FlashMessage class methods invoked form JSPs.", 
   "These changes were made to limit usage of session attributes and to ensure that persistent object instances are not stored in the session where they would become unmanaged outside of a transactional scope.", 
   "See WOOKIE-144 for more details.", 
   "Thanks to Randy Watler for the patch."
