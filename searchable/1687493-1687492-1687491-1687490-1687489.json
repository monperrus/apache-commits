   "I have changed the parameters so that they are not read-only any more.", 
   "However due to MNG-5440 you cannot yet set values for source directories in your own POM. Once a fix for that issue has been made to Maven core I will add an integration test for this issue, that will require at least that version of Maven to run. I have not committed the provided documentation changes yet. That will have to wait until it is actually possible to configure things that way."
