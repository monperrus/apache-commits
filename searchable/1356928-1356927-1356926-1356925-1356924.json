   "[master] Parallelize closing writers in HLogSplitter", 
   "Author: avf", 
   "Summary:", 
   "SequenceFileWriter does its own buffering. These buffers are flushed", 
   "during a call to close. Currently all writers are closed sequentially.", 
   "This patch creates a thread pool of configurable size (configured by", 
   "hbase.hlog.split.close.threads, default 10) where close() method is", 
   "executed on each WriterAndPath object.", 
   "Not porting this to HBase trunk, as HBASE-6134 takes a different", 
   "approach.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "Verified correctness by running unit tests for HLogSplitter (will run", 
   "all unit tests through MRUnit before commiting to svn).", 
   "Will test performance by splitting an existing logfile with and", 
   "without this change.",

   "[HBASE-6215] Per-request profiling", 
   "Author: aurickq",

   "1. Ability to switch on profiling using HTable interface, which will ask the server to send back profiling data with each RPC call.", 
   "2. Ability to set request tag at HTable level, so server may aggregate stats based on these tags.", 
   "3. Bumped RPC version to support profiling and new HBaseRPCOptions object. RPC compression and profiling now use this object.",
