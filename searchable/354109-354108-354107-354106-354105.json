   "Re-work the logic for deserializing arrays to use peek when determinining if any more elements are present, otherwise we're unable to correctly use the peek afterwards until a complete element has been read.",

   "Including latest fixes for ElementFormDefaultTest which initially highlighted this problem, and added into unitTest.list.", 
   "Also updated NillableArraysClient.cpp to thoroughly check all return parameters - this test also highlighted a small problem with deserializing elements containing xsi:nil=\"true\"."
