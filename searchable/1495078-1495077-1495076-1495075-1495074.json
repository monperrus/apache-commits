   "no Jira - 2nd try for release prepare found dependency on not-yet-released version 5 of the uima-build-resources in the parent-pom.  Override this for (just) the parent-pom (using a profile only activated for that pom's build).  Hope that overriding is not needed (because this will be built in the \"reactor\" and therefore be available) for itself and uima-build-helper-maven-plugin."
