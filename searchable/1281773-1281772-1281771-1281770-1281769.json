   "When selecting cell(s), don't allow a cell in a column which has visible=false be selected.  If a cell range is selected that spans columns that aren't visible, internally, the cell range will be broken up into regions that contain only the visible columns.  If a column becomes invisible, and either the anchorColumnIndex or the caretColumnIndex were set to that column, reinitialize to the first visible column, or -1 if there aren't any.  Fix up how the old caret position is saved so the CARET_CHANGE event will have the correct values.",
