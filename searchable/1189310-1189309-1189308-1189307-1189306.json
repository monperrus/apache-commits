   "Added a YouTube Player widget, with synchronisation between users (if Wave is enabled) so you can all users in the same context can watch the same movie. Uses  JSONP as in the patch Bryan Copeland submitted for WOOKIE-141 using Yvo Schaap's example code, but is written from scratch rather than using the patch as I wanted to use a JQuery-based player, and add in collaboration/synching as per the example that Sten Govaerts demo'ed at the Apache Hackathon. I'm adding to the scratchpad for now, but could be a candidate for the core widgets set."
