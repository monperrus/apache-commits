   "Fixup ASdoc for text styles and properties in TextArea/TextInput/SkinnableTextBase which are common to spark and mobile text but have different descriptions/values.  We are restricted to how we can format the doc since there can only be one @copy and it must be last.  In addition, we do not want the summary line to be \"Not supported for the mobile theme\".  Stephen Gilson and I worked out a template which uses @see rather than @copy since there can be multiple @see tags.  Look at SkinnableTextBase.editable for an example when mobile supports the property and SkinnableTextBase.typicalText for an example when mobile does not support the property.",
