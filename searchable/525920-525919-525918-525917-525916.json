   "* Fixed exit function. When standard exit() is used, C++ destructors for static objects are executed. In this case other threads which use these static usually crash. This happens most often in JIT code which seems to use a lot of static C++ objects. Instead FatalError will use _exit() which doesn't execute C++ destructors.",
