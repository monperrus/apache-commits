   "Based on suggestion from Daniel Dekany (committer/maintainer of the Freemarker's project):", 
   "\"Since BeansWrapper.getDefaultInstance() returns an instance that is", 
   "shared in the scope of the class-loader that defined the FreeMarker", 
   "classes, and since possibly multiple independently developed", 
   "components in your system use FreeMarker and thus getDefaultInstance", 
   "(and you may don't even know about it), and since the returned", 
   "BeanWrapper can be configured (not read-only), you never know how the", 
   "returned BeanWrapper is configured. So you add a 3rd party component,", 
   "and if you are unlucky, suddenly your other component is broken.", 
   "As of creating new BeansWrapper, be sure you create it only once", 
   "during the application life-cycle and then reuse the same instance, or", 
   "else it will have to rebuild the class introspection cache again and", 
   "again.\"", 
   "I have replaced the usage of the static instance of the BeansWrapper with a newly created object."
