   "Simplified the incremental build plugin and made it more reliable. Removed all the complicated code that was trying to detect stale sources. Handle the case where an IDE has compiled the Java sources but the output archive is outdated. Keep track of failed tests using a .test marker file and re-execute the tests on subsequent builds."
