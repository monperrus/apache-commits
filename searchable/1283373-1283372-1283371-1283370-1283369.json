   "Fixed sdk-16853, sdk-17341, sdk-16855, sdk-16681, sdk-16668, sdk-16851, sdk-16480. The main change is that the new Wait effect has gone away and its functionality (optionally waiting for an event) is instead merged into the old Pause effect. Some enhancements were added to Pause along the way. Also fixed other random effects issues, such as waiting to raise the effectStart event until after startDelay elapses (like the old Flex3 effect behavior).",

   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",
