   "ARIES-173 I backed out this branch to start the whole RC creation process again, but really I just need to do it for jpa and the modules that depend on jpa - i.e. samples. So with this commit I'm putting the jndi, transaction, eba-maven-plugin, parent, jmx, application, blueprint, testsupport, util. and web modules back to where they were after the RC2 was posted. Subsequently the jpa and samples modules will be ready for RC3 creation."
