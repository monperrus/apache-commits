   "Roll back changes made to make deep integration work. This means removing a number of cases where the node tries to talk to the domain. The node only does this now when the node starts or when a contribution/composite is added directly to a node in the domain. These cases can also probably go in due course. This change also moves the model build/activation to where the composite is added to the node. This leaves start/stop free just to act as start and stop commands."
