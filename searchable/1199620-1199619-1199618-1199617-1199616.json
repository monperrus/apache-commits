   "Now merely cd into \"my-ops-ui\" or whatever you designated as the artifactId and then type \"mvn tomcat:run-war\". You should then be able to head to http://localhost:8080/my-ops-ui and see the app running. You should of course set the variables in the src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml or have those environment variables set. If you would like to skin this new opsui merely follow the same structure as the opsui project in the OODT trunk. There will be a wiki to further describe this skinning process at some point."
