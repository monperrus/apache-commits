   "Deprecating the loopSubContentCache transform because it is a huge mess and the loopSubContent uses the cache anyway; also found that the DemoWebSitePublishPointData.xml file had half of the ContentAssocs going one way, and half another; that is now fixed so they always go from parent to child; this required changes to the loopSubContent transform and various other cleanups along the way and a few fixes; some of these sample uses of the content infrastructure have got to be close to the worst code I've so hopefully someone will have some time to continue cleaning this up and keep their head about them while doing so in order to not make it worse"
