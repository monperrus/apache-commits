   "Added experimental ShortUrlRedirectFilter, which intercepts URLs written in the \"short URL\" scheme and redirects them to the correct ActionBean URLs. When used in conjunction with FileBasedActionResolver, it allows backwards compatibility to be preserved with \"permalink\" short URLs for viewing, while freeing up implementors to specify their own completely customized URL schemes. This filter is turned off by default. So that it can be more easily turned on and off, this may be refactored into a Stripes Interceptor later. But for now, it's a filter. Murray, this one's for you."
