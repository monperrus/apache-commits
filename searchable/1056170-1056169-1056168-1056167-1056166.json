   "The backport of DERBY-4874 from trunk to 10.6 codeline was done by hand (rather than a simple migration from trunk) because the changes in trunk depended on DERBY-1482. DERBY-1482 can't be backported to 10.6 and earlier because it had required system level changes which can't be backported to pre-released Derby products."
