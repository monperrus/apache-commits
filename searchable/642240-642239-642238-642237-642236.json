   "The shell has a problem when being stopped using the BundleActivator.stop() method but not getting any input because it is blocked on System.in. This patch fixes the issue by using the ready() method to wait until input is available. There still is a race condition in case more then one Thread is listening on System.in but we can ignore this for now because in case the race condition happens we default to the old behaviour."
