   "Enhancement: Added grant block in jspwiki for administrator groups principal com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.GroupPrincipal \"Admin\" (wiki group) and principal com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.authorize.Role \"Admin\" (container role). Added new wiki page to distribution, GroupAdmin.txt with an empty (disabled) membership, which makes the administrator group secure by default. We expect that a future enhancement to Install.jsp will overwrite the contents of this file, thus \"enabling\" the admin group. Bug fix: Fixed error in jspwiki.policy."
