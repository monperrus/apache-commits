   "2) The previous sed statement was replacing any reference to ___PROJECTNAME___ or ___PROJECTNAMEASIDENTIFIER___. This is wrong, it should only be replacing the last reference to ___PROJECTNAME___. For example:",

   "If you replace all instances of ___PROJECTNAME___ with $PROJECT_NAME in the example above, the mv doesn't work."

Because I was not always finding the audioFile in audioDidFinishPlaying the success callback was not getting called even though the media did successfully play.",
