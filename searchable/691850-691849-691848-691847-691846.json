   "Two changes, complementary to one another.", 
   "1. Augmenting Gadget to maintain its own parse tree state, consistent with its own String representation.", 
   "- addition of Gadget.getParseTree()", 
   "- Added EditListener to GadgetHtmlNode created from ParsedHtmlNode indicating when original contents (created", 
   "from parsed) are modified. Gadget code prevents edits from being made when new String content is set.", 
   "2. Changing ContentRewriter Gadget rewriting interface to ContentRewriter.rewrite(Gadget).", 
   "In addition, added a few small cleanups, such as using Gadget rather than hacky QueryPair in CachingContentRewriterRegistry for cache lookups.", 
   "This commit resolves SHINDIG-503."
