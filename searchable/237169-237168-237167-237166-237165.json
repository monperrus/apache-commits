   "Major refactoring of the build systems and directory layout:",

   "* Some other cosmetic changes", 
   "* Added scripts for Tomcat 3.x (However, I get a strange error while running Tomcat 3.3.1. Not sure why yet (some flushbuffer() jasper error))", 
   "* WL 7.x script has been tested and works (for JDK < 1.4)",

   "* The Gump build is probably not working at all (I'll correct it as I receive Gump email notifications of errors)", 
   "* The Clover report is currently broken (i.e. not generated)",

   "* Pb of order in Sample Servlet test cases (one of the test must run before the other but this is not currently possible with the Ant Petal)", 
   "* WL 6.x script needs to be tested"
