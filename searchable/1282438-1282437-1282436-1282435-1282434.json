   "The reason for this change is to make the code a little cleaner in terms of the separation between DataGroup and List.  Now DataGroup won\u2019t do any work if the mx_internal _rendererUpdateDelegate is set.  If it is set (to a List for instance), then _rendererUpdateDelegate.updateRenderer(renderer, itemIndex, data) will be called.  This makes the updateRenderer() pass more clear because it\u2019s all done in the rendererUpdateDelegate (rather than splitting it in DataGroup and ListBase).  It also makes it easier to get the ordering of properties correctly as we want the \u201cdata\u201d property to be the last set property as part of the \u201citem renderer contract\u201d.", 
   "As part of this change, DataGroup is the default _rendererUpdateDelegate, and because of this it now implements IItemRendererOwner.  The only other method on IItemRendererOwner besides updateRenderer() is itemToLabel().  DataGroup already had a private itemToLabel() method, so I\u2019m just making it public.",
