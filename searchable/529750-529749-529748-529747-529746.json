   "New fix for BEEHIVE-1162. In svn revision 483829 I changed TreeElement class to use a LinkedHashMap instead of an ArrayList for the set of attributes. However, the _attributes field was public, implying an API change. In this revision I've changed this field back to an ArrayList and added code in addAttribute() to check if an attribute is being reset. The test case for this bug still passes.",
