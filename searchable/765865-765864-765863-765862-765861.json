   "Fixed a problem where service definitions were using \"GenericValue\" as attribute types, but that threw exceptions because the service definitions needed the full class name - \"org.ofbiz.entity.GenericValue\". The problem was reported in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-2268 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-2311.", 
   "I checked the commit logs and I don't see what changed to cause these services to stop working, so I took the shotgun approach and changed all occurrences of GenericValue service attributes.", 
   "If anyone has a better solution, please feel free to revert this commit and change it."
