   "GERONIMO-3155 Minimal assemblies have doubled in size due to Yoko being included.  Added the xml-attribute and resource back into the connector-deployer, but removed the included yoko depend, so the minimal assemblies don't need yoko (they still need the yoko specs for the ORB class.)  Added the xml-attribute to the JEE5 server configs as an attribute with the Yoko depend."
