   "* Removed code maintaining a weak reference to the parent connection manager in the AbstractConnPool. The weak reference to the connection manager is currently used to shut down the pool when the connection manager gets GC-ed. The same net result can be achieved by calling #shutdown from #finalize() of the connection manager class.", 
   "* Shut down connection managers in #finalize().", 
   "* There is no point passing ClientConnectionOperator around. It can be assigned to the connection pool once at the construction time."
