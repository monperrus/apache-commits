   "[master] GC disabled L2 cache and reset some stat counters", 
   "Author: arjen", 
   "Summary: During the testing of disabling the L2 cache I forgot to check if the memory allocated to the L2 cache is properly released to the OS, allowing it to be reused as FS cache and continue running in a known state. This diff properly releases the memory used by the L2 cache and resets some of the metrics to reflect this.", 
   "Test Plan: Built and deployed a jar to hbase481.frc3. While running with L2 cache enabled the resident memory is ~32GB. After disabling the cache the rresident memory drops to ~24GB and ODS graphs reflect this change properly.",
