   "Remove stripes dependency from base-runtime as it hides the actual stripes dependency and hence it's not included in the distro or the PDE target. The net result is that tuscany-stripes doesn't compile in eclipse PDE and if you remove tuscany-stripes lots of other things complain. This change fixes the second effect."
