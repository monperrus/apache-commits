   "20061216 1214 This solution creates a BSF_LogFactory and BSF_Log class which will by default behave as an no-op logger. In case commons-logging LogFactory and Log is available, it will be used. Hence the functionality remains the same, but the change will allow BSF to run without commons-logging present (possibly easying installation issues considerably). A build of BSF incorporating all these changes can be downloaded from <http://wi.wu-wien.ac.at/rgf/tmp/bsf.tmp/>"
