   "Added default minimum memory sizes for each OS/architecture which requires more than 512 MB of RAM in the %VM_OS_CONFIGURATION hash.  Updated get_vm_ram to use this value.", 
   "Added code to capture subroutine to save the vmx file used on the VM being captured along with the vmdk files. This vmx file can later be used as a reference. Added get_reference_vmx_file_name, get_reference_vmx_file_path, and get_reference_vmx_info subroutines.", 
   "Updated copy_vmdk to also copy the reference vmx file when copying a vmdk.", 
   "Updated get_vmdk_parameter_value to allow it to retrieve a parameter from the vmdk file if it resides on the VM host. It previously only checked the files on the management node.", 
   "Updated get_vm_disk_adapter_type and get_vm_virtual_hardware_version to try to first retrieve the type from the reference vmx file. This should allow VMs using the LSI SAS adapter type to work correctly."
