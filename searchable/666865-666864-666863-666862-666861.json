   "Remove calls to Options#setAction in VFSEchoRawXMLTest: the VFS transport doesn't have transport headers (at least for vfs:file: endpoints) and addressing is not enabled in these unit tests. Therefore the calls to Options#setAction are useless. Moreover they are incorrect and misleading because the operation really invoked is echoOMElement, not echoOMElementNoResponse."
