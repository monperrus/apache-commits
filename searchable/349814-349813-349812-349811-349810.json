   "Submitted By: John Casey", 
   "Commented out the loadClass(..) method in IsolatedClassLoader, and added a new constructor that allows the user to define a parent classloader. Then, the surefire booter includes ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() as the parent to the isolated classloader it creates for testing...", 
   "NOTE: This may break some things, since the loadClass(..) method in IsolatedClassLoader reversed the normal parent-first loading strategy. I'm committing it so Jason can take a look, since he wrote the IsolatedClassLoader (or at least committed it)."
