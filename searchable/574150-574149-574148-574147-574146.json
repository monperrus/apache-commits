   "[JS2-779] Supporting Pocket PC", 
   "After discussion with David Sean Taylor, I decided to do the followings for the 2.1.3 release:", 
   "- To create a valve named 'capabilityCustomizerValve', which would change the preferred mediaType of the capabilityMap and the requestContext just after the capabilityValve finished.", 
   "This valve should decide the mediaType based on the given client-to-mediaType mappings as a", 
   "constructor argument. For example, \"ie4ppc (client name) to html-basic (media type name)\".", 
   "Also add some seed data for Pocket IE (mediaType and client).", 
   "This improvement does not change any database schema, and tries to minimize the impacts on the 2.1.3 release.", 
   "We need to review more for better solution and consider reworking it for the 2.2 release.", 
   "Probably, We can remove the capabilityCustomizerValve in the 2.2 release.", 
   "(So, I will not commit to the /trunk.)"
