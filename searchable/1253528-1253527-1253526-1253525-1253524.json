   "We no longer build an internal variant of fcsh.jar that had support for the old profiler.", 
   "They confusingly had the same name and lived in the same directory, so building one would wipe out the other. This variant was packaged into utilities.zip, but now utilities.zip has the same fcsh.jar that is in flex_sdk_3.zip.", 
   "Removed the top-level 'fcsh' target in sdk/build.xml, because fcsh.jar is now built by the 'compiler' target that builds the other compilation-related JARs.", 
   "Removed the flex2.tools.Shell class used by the internal variant of fcsh.jar, and its (empty) localization files. This class would not compile (or presumably execute) without the old profiler.jar.",
