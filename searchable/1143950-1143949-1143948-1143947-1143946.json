   "ARIES-686 The whiteboard project currently registers MBeans as a StandardMBean, however this does not work too well as MBeans that emit notifications don't work. The core bundle has a class that makes this work. Moving this to its own package means we can share it between the whiteboard and core projects simply. So this moves a class in jmx-core into a new package, updates references to it and then uses this from the jmx-whiteboard project."
