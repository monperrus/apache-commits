   "Initial version of the DOM tree based rewriting. The tree is generated using php's DOMDocument (libxml2), and classes can implement tag name based observers for the elements they want to process. The Content Rewriter is already functional but not complete yet, smarter style parsing still needs to be added (dealing with import etc statements), and once it's stable enough, the rewriting should also be added to the ProxyHandler. To enable the rewriting in the proxy handler the rewriter adds a gadget=url to the proxy url, so it can use that to get the rewrite spec"
