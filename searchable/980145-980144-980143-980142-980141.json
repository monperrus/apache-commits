   "My initial checkin was not entirely correct as it does violate the JMS spec for property type conversion, since it will now first convert all property types (except Double) to a String and then on to a Double. Only Floats, Doubles, and Strings are allowed to be read back as a Double value, everything else should throw a MessageFormatException. Thx Robbie for pointing this out."
