   "Make some changes in order to better support multi-architecture binaries.", 
   "To accomplish this, we need to be able to configure once, and compile multiple", 
   "times (once for each architecture). So our checks in configure should, ideally,", 
   "be environment-specific, rather than architecture-specific.", 
   "In line with this, I modified tests for the integer type selection to look", 
   "first for standard types defined by the compiler/environment that give us the", 
   "information we need. We first look for (and use, if possible) uint16_t,", 
   "for instance, rather than checking whether the size of an integer is 2 bytes.", 
   "So as long as the compiler environment knows how to supply the appropriate type,", 
   "we don't care that an integer might be 2 bytes on one architecture, and 4 in", 
   "another. We can accomodate the build of a mixed architecture binary that might", 
   "include both. (Theoretically...)"
