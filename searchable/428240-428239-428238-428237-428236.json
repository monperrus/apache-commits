   "JAMES-585.  This change consists of the following changes:", 
   "1) RemoteManagerHander.java", 
   "Added two UNDOCUMENTED commands:", 
   "1) SHOWTRACKERS - Call the FileCleaner to display", 
   "a list of files that it is tracking to delete.", 
   "2) GC - Force a JVM garbage collection, which will", 
   "normally cause the FileCleaner to delete files", 
   "whose marker object (MimeMessageInputStreamSource", 
   "in our case) is not currently reachable.", 
   "2) MimeMessageInputStreamSource.java", 
   "Three changes:", 
   "1) Register all temporary files with FileCleaner.", 
   "2) At Stefano's suggestion, revert change to use", 
   "SharedFileInputStream,", 
   "3) Comment out finalize(), which is replaced by", 
   "using FileCleaner. The mere presence of the", 
   "finalize() method can actually cause problems.", 
   "3) FileCleaner", 
   "Two changes from what I copied from Commons I/O:", 
   "1) Add some instrumentation to let us inspect the", 
   "state of the tracker collection.", 
   "2) Print (to System.err, normally redirected to", 
   "${JAMES}/temp/phoenix.console) an error if", 
   "we cannot delete the file when asked.", 
   "In both cases, a stack trace is used to let us see", 
   "how the file was allocated, just to make sure that", 
   "we're not missing something about the behavior.", 
   "So far, with these changes I am no longer seeing any leaks.  A few times, there were some files still around, but forcing a GC cleaned them up.  The instrumentation was added to help investigate this behavior."
