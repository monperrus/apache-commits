   "o The loadAllEnabled()/loadWithDependencies() methods now return the list of errors if the schema is invalid", 
   "o They also take an additionnal parameter (check) to tell the method if it should check the registries when the schema have been loaded", 
   "o Added some flags in the Registries class to handle a strict/relaxed checking, and to allow disabled SchemaObjects", 
   "o Fixed the tests to reflect these changes", 
   "o Reviewed the registerXXX methods",
