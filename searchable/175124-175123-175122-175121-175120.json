   "The patch fixes Bugzilla #19787, #20006, #20009, #20010 and #20287, and", 
   "several other issues. A summary of the changes is listed below:", 
   "1. Added '[' and ']' to reserved characters as per RFC 2732.", 
   "2. '[' and ']' added in RFC 2732, are not allowed in path segments, but", 
   "may appear in the opaque part.", 
   "3. No URI can begin with a ':'.", 
   "4. URI has no scheme if ':' occurs in a URI after '?' or '#', it's part of", 
   "the query string or fragment.", 
   "5. Whitespace (even escaped as %20) is not permitted in the authority", 
   "portion of a URI.", 
   "6. IPv4 addresses must match 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT \".\" 1*3DIGIT \".\"", 
   "1*3DIGIT. Since RFC 2732.", 
   "7. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit, therefore no segment may be larger than 255.", 
   "This isn't expressed by the grammar.", 
   "8. Hostnames cannot end with a '-'.", 
   "9. Labels in a hostname must be 63 bytes or less [RFC 1034].", 
   "10. Hostnames may be no longer than 255 bytes [RFC 1034]. (That", 
   "restriction was already there. I just moved it inwards.", 
   "11. Added support for IPv6 references added in RFC 2732. URIs such as", 
   "http://[::ffff:1.2.3.4] are valid. The BNF in RFC 2373 isn't correct. IPv6", 
   "addresses are read according to section 2.2 of RFC 2373."
