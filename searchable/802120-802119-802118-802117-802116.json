   "QPID-2033 : Added destroy for broker process that fails to startup. Also augmented QpidTestCase and build profiles to take a new broker.stopped search value. If this appears in the log output during the external broker startup and the broker does not report ready then the startup will report the line of text associated with the exception as part of the failure. Currently the stopped value is set to to 'Exception'. This means if an exception occurs during startup then test will give more detail about the cause of the failure. This is only monitored during the brokerStart() call and through the getStopLine() call on the Piper we can return the line of text that the Exception matched. Providing more details of why a broker failed to startup. This extra detail is currently added to the exception thrown when the broker fails to become ready.",
