   "Fixed logic in the HTTP status code check for Query Exception.  An IOException was getting thrown trying to read from the connection's input stream when the HTTP status was 401, which was leading to a generic QueryException (with no status code attached) getting thrown.  This change moves the status code check up into the big try/catch block."
