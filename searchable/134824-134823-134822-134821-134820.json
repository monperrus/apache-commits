   "Added more examples and things to do. Also added parent relationship to Tag interface and make the body script a property of Tags so that they can modify and change their body at will (e.g. be a pre-processor or macro). Also added early version of core tags with a stub implementation of ExpressionFactory which I'll try get working with beanshell. A velocity & rhino implementation would be nice too..."

   "First alpha-cut of a little research project called Jelly. Its a simple XML tag based scripting language. It borrows ideas from JSP taglibs, Velocity and XDoclet. For those that like Velocity-style syntax we should be able to layer a non-XML parser on top of the standard XML representation. Its still work in progress but any comments would be welcome"
