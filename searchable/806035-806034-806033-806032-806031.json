   "LDAP support for user databases, authentication and authorization has landed in the trunk. It has been tested with Active Directory and OpenLDAP, and is customizable for other LDAP servers. See jspwiki.properties for more details. Note that a user-accessible way of configuring the \"Keychain\" for storing bind DN passwords is still not available, but will be coming soon in a revamped installer screen. LdapLoginModule was removed, because it's actually much cleaner to use the UserDatabaseLoginModule instead."
