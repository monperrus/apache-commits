   "Added sanitize_files subroutines to Windows.pm, Version_5.pm, and Version_6.pm, which remove the Windows root password from various files depending on the version of Windows.  Added call to Windows.pm::post_load.",

Added get_time_zone_name and get_time_zone_code subroutines to Windows.pm.  These determine the name and Windows numerical code the correspond to the time zone configured for the management node.", 
   "Updated Version_5.pm::get_sysprep_inf_contents to call get_time_zone_code and use this value when generating the sysprep.inf file rather than using the hard-coded value for EST.",

   "Other", 
   "Removed prepare_newsid subroutine from Windows.pm and changed Vista.pm to call prepare_post_load rather than prepare_newsid.", 
   "Reduced the timeout values in Version_6.pm::wait_for_response if Sysprep is not used.  Loads were waiting for 3 minutes unnecessarily on Version 6 images which don't use Sysprep."
