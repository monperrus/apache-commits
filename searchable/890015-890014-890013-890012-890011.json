   "Some changes for getting the webapp alive.  I changed the webui project artifact type from 'bundle' to 'war', but it's not clear to me that is the right thing to do.  Additionally, the gwt-dnd jar that was missing from the central repo has been added to 'repo' root node of the subversion tree as a Maven repository layout as a fix, and I offered their project assistance with setting up a proper repo on their end.  The app runs, but I don't have the experience yet with getting the server set up completely to know it is final."
