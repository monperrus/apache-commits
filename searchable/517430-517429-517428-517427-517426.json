   "WW-1786 \"using session-token interceptor generates FreeMarker template error\" Apply patch submitted by Tom Schneider. The change synchronizes on the Ognl context so we don't concurrently execute results. The issue was that we were getting concurrency exceptions around the ognl context because the results were being executed concurrently. The change will reduce throughput when using the session-token interceptor, but it avoids the concurrency issues."
