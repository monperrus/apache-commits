   "Allow setting supported character encodings for the W3CWidgetFactory in the same manner as setting supported locales, and added supporting tests. This is important as otherwise there is no way to specify a set of supported encodings for the parser other than editing the IW3CXMLConfiguration constants.", 
   "As part of this change I've moved the \"processWidgetPackage\" method out of WidgetPackageUtils and into the W3CWidgetFactory - this made sense as all its parameters apart from the file it parses were instance variables of the W3CWidgetFactory anyway."
