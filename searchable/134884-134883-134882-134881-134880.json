   "Added support for Jelly Stylesheet Language tags (JSL) which are an implementation of an XSLT style declarative transformation engine.", 
   "The whole thing uses 3 tags, <jsl:stylesheet>, <jsl:template> and <jsl:applyTemplates> that work neatly with the XML taglib from JSTL.", 
   "This allows XSLT like processing to be cleanly mixed with JSTL tags in a single Jelly script; also JSL is totally dynamic, so the stylesheet can be dynamically created and invoked.", 
   "There are example targets demo.jsl and demo.jsl2 that demonstrate JSL in action"
