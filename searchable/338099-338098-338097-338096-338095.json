   "Applying patch for Jira bug report XALANJ-1640.", 
   "As it's currently written, SerializerUtils.outputResultTreeFragment loops", 
   "through the nodes in a result tree fragment, and for each one, it checks", 
   "whether the node is in some namespace.  If it is not, the code undeclares the", 
   "default namespace by calling handler.startPrefixMapping(\"\", \"\").  The problem", 
   "is that if the RTF that's being copied just consists of a text node (or PIs or", 
   "comments), that undeclaration of the default namespace hangs around until some", 
   "subsequent child element picks it up as one of its attributes, even if that", 
   "element is in some namespace - even what should be the default!", 
   "The fix is to check whether the node that is being output is an element node", 
   "prior to issuing the handler.startPrefixMapping call - that ensures the prefix", 
   "mapping is not issued unless it's actually going to be used by the node that is", 
   "about to be serialized.", 
   "This patch was reviewed by Brian Minchau (minchau () ca ! ibm ! com)."
