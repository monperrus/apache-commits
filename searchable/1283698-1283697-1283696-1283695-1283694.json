   "Made layout constraint animation actually work. Animating constraints (left, right, etc.) with the Animate effect worked previously, but only if the animation values were explicitly specified or, in a transition, if both states had valid values for the constraint. But if you attempted to run a transition animating \"left\" where the constraint was cleared in either state, the animation would fail.", 
   "The fix checks for invalid values in the states and, when they occur, animates other related properties instead, or in addition. For example, an animation on \"left\" may turn into an animation on \"x\".",
