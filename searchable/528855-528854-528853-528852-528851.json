   "WICKET-432. 1) htmlbodycontainer is now added in onattach instead of constructor so we do not try to load markup and thus call overridable getstyle()/getvariation() from the constructor of the superclass at a point where the page object is not yet fully constructed. 2) removed bodycontainer in favor of IHeaderContributor. this means we lost functionality such as panels contributing body onload attributes to the page, but it is much better for those panels to implement IHeaderContributor. have one consistent way of handling such things."
