   "Removed XSL transformation from the Browse template, and updated the Widget Browser example. I replaced the XSL transformation with simple token replacement using a HTML file as the detail template that the designer edits, and a list of elements and attributes in the widget properties file to use for replacing the tokens in the template. This is a lot less sophisticated than using XSL, but overcomes the issue of browser compatibility (See WOOKIE-297). For more complex replacement, the widget designer could override the actual JavaScript and put in some of their own rules. Note that the ItemDetail template still uses XSLT."
