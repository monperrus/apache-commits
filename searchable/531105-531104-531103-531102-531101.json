   "Spent the day with yourkit profiler again in an attempt to track down why the LocaleList page in the demo was taking so long to render on demo box. (somewhere around 500ms)", 
   "-) Added a new pooled OgnlContext helper class that pools OgnlContext object creation as there is no need to just randomly create a bunch of context objects since OgnlContext.clear() works perfectly well for this purpose.", 
   "-) Slight tweeks made to DirectService / Any / ComponentEventConnectionWorker where it was clear that they were doing certain bad things to cause unneccessary overhead.", 
   "-) Started doing more logic in ExpressionBinding to handle the different stages of compilation (ie when expression can't be fully evaluated because of a null thus preventing compilation ). Added a compilation step (with backing off strategy) for expressions where only a setter is implemented."
