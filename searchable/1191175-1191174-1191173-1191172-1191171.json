   "Fixed building of phonegap.js in build script. Fixed GPS on Android 2.0+ - I guess they updated the version of WebKit being used on Android (similar now to how it works on iPhone) and thus the browser has a native navigator.geolocation object. Employed Jesse`s approach to proxying an object`s method since we can`t directly overwrite it."
