   "FLEX-33347 - If DateSpinner is in dateAndTime mode you can't spin forward from Jan 31 to date in February or if set on March 31 can't spin forward to date in April, etc. The fix is to set the date variable's month field before the date field (day of the month).  If the date is Jan 31 and you set the month to February, since Feb 31 isn't valid, Flash sets the month to March.  Unfortunately I don't think there is a workaround for this bug."
