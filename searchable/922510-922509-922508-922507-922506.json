   "Special thanks to Scott for his valuable comments.", 
   "PS: Scott regarding to you point # 2 in the last comment, I think it would be fine if we keep association as it in the current patch. Because all the ContentType already exists in the ProductContentType entity. In general we can associate Image, PDF or word document with any promotion so reusing existing entity will be fine IMO."
