   "The Error.jsp references were made consistent in all JSPs. Rather than use JSTL syntax (which won't evaluate when used with <% page errorPage %> tag), the references now all use /Error.jsp, which itself jsp:includes the template JSP Error.jsp using JSTL. This makes the error page customizable per-template, but still very easy to use."
