   "Don't write an 'rpm' target into the Makefile on Windows. It isn't relevant on Windows, and the (hard-coded, not MakeMaker-generated) recipe group has syntax which dmake doesn't understand.", 
   "Using MinGW/+dmake to build mod_perl on Windows seems doomed to failure since that would require a MinGW build of Apache too, which is not well supported at best. However, this change means that any attempt to do so at least gets you down to the real problem (it starts compiling the first source file and falls over because a header file is missing), rather than choking on an invalid Makefile.", 
   "It also allows for building with VC+dmake (rather than its native nmake), which is an option supported by Perl and inherited by mod_perl via MakeMaker."
