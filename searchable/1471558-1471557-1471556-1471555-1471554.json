   "Merge -c 1471556 from trunk to branch-2 to fix MAPREDUCE-4737. Ensure that mapreduce APIs are semantically consistent with mapred API w.r.t Mapper.cleanup and Reducer.cleanup; in the sense that cleanup is now called even if there is an error. The old mapred API already ensures that Mapper.close and Reducer.close are invoked during error handling. Note that it is an incompatible change, however end-users can override Mapper.run and Reducer.run to get the old (inconsistent) behaviour. Contributed by Arun C. Murthy."
