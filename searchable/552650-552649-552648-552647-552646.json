   "The attached patch does the following things:", 
   "1. reports error if -XX propery format is broken (-XX:+key, -XX:-key or -XX:key=[value] is allowed), i.e. '-XX:gc.dll=' is a proper specification (of empty value) while '-XX:gc.dll' argument produces error ('initialize_properties' returnns the status code now).", 
   "2. renamed 'vm.dlls' to 'gc.dll'\". This required to do the following:", 
   "2.1 add a check that \"gc.dll\" property is always set (the vm_init code expects this property is set either to default value or it is set through command line)", 
   "2.2 remove \"parsing cycle\" of gc.dll (previously \"vm.dlls\" may contain the list of DLLs)", 
   "I've tested DRLVM with different variants of related command line - works as expected."
