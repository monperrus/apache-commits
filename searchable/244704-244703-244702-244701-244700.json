   "WARNING : THIS IS NOT FULLY COMPLETE.  IT NEEDS AT LEAST",

   "AT YOUR OWN RISK.", 
   "Summary:", 
   "The big difference here is that there's no DOM.  We now use a custom data", 
   "structure which is built by parsing a stream of SAX events.  The", 
   "SOAPSAXParser class is the parser - you initialize it and hook it up to", 
   "a SAX event stream, and it happily fills in the message data structures", 
   "for you.  NOTE: it does this in a \"lazy\" fashion, so there are pause()", 
   "and continue() methods which allow the parse to start, and then stop", 
   "when you've found what you're looking for.", 
   "During a parse, there is a DeserializationContext object which keeps track", 
   "of the current namespace/prefix mappings, which elements map to which IDs,", 
   "and the current set of type mappings for deserialization.  (see the", 
   "encoding package)", 
   "Elements that we scan over, or ones for which we don't have a particular", 
   "deserializer, are recorded - in other words, the SAX events are placed into", 
   "a queue which may be 'played back' at a later time to any SAX", 
   "ContentHandler.", 
   "Once a SOAPEnvelope has been built, either through a parse or manual", 
   "construction by the user, it may be output using a SerializationContext (also", 
   "see the encoding package).  MessageElements all have an output() method", 
   "which lets them write out their contents.", 
   "There's a lot that still needs doing, but the basics are here.  More info", 
   "on the axis-dev list.", 
   "Code-level changes:  Too many to list"
