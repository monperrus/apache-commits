   "make future reservations that would be part of a block allocation included in the block allocation", 
   "utils.php: modified isAvailable - added additional parameter that can be passed - $skipconcurrentcheck; if this is set to 1, it does not check the overlapping count for reservations of that image; when working with block allocations, it is often useful to call isAvailable for the block allocated time plus a leading reload amount, but then to only make the reservation for the leading reload time; this can cause an overlap for the check but not for the actual reservation", 
   "xmlrpcWrappers.php: modified XMLRPCprocessBlockTime - added code to look for any future reservations made by users in the user group associated with the block allocation for the same image; if so, try to include them in the block allocation to keep from tying up additional machines"
