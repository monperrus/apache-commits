   "[MNG-1891] Fixed plugin ordering in profile injection AND model inheritance, to be consistent and to preserve as much ordering information as possible, to make plugin ordering more predictable. Also added several unit tests to express the problem(s) and verify the solutions. Ordering is in javadoc comments, and should be added to the plugin-configuration documentation on the site."
