   "- Access the SocketImpl FileDescriptor using reflection so its getFileDescriptor() method can be made protected again, as spec'ed.", 
   "- Make SSLServerSocketImpl use SSLParameters to get/set its options instead of going via the SSLSocket. The way this was implemented before meant that multiple accepts on the same server socket were not possible.", 
   "- Make the SSLSocketWrapper class function correctly by replacing its SocketImpl with the one in the Socket it is being created with. This fixes behaviour when SSLSocketFactory is used to create a SSLSocket from an existing socket."
