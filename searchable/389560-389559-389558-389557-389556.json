   "Add support for running the Page Flow annotation processor in two phases -- the \"reconcile\" and \"build\" phases -- as per the implementation of JDT/APT for hosting annotation processors inside of Eclipse.  In such an environment, a flag is provided by the AP hosting infrastructure that tells APs whether Eclipse is running a reconcile or build phase.  These map to the \"build\" and \"generate\" phases of Beehive's TwoPhaseAnnotationProcessor.", 
   "This change allows Eclipse to run the AP to reconcile without going through the expesne of writing out all of the generated files (generally, struts-config-*.xml files).  This improves performance when using Ecilpse + JDT/APT or using Eclipse 3.2 which supports this natively.",
