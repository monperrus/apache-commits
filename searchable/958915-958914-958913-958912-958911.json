   "As to java.util.Properties.store(os, comments) method, if the comments argument is not null, then '#' character and a line separator are first written to the output stream. Thus, the comments can serve as an identifying comment. Any '\\n', '\\r' or \"\\r\\n\" in comments is replaced by a line separator generated by the Writer and if the next character in comments is not character # or character ! then an ASCII # is written out after that line separator.", 
   "This patch fixes the above issue. In addition, it includes several test cases for coverage."
