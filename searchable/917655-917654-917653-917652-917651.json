   "Added disable_shutdown_event_tracker() subroutine to Windows.pm. This is called by pre_capture(). It prevents the box from appearing asking for a reason when the computer is shutdown, rebooted. The box may also appear at login if the computer was shut down unexpectedly. Reservations will fail if this happens just prior to an image being saved. The setting is enabled by default on Windows Server.",

   "Added code to make multiple ipconfig attempts in Windows.pm::get_network_configuration(). This command occasionally fails, but succeeds if another attempt is made."
