   "- canceling the timeout task should be done without interrupt (serves little purpose)", 
   "- made the timeoutHandle variable in HttpRequestMessage an atomic reference to ensure correct visibility", 
   "- set the timeout handle to null at the beginning of the timeout task to minimize the window during which other events may get a hold of the timeout handle", 
   "- marked the request as close pending any time we initiate session closing", 
   "- when we check out a session from the cache, check the pending close status so if it has a pending close, do not use it", 
   "- in cancelTask(), use the removeTimeoutHandle() method to retrieve and remove the handle atomically", 
   "- moved up the Future.set() and Future.setException() operations to prior to the monitoring listener notification", 
   "- ensure only one callback method fires for a given request by using a flag", 
   "- eat up any Throwable that may result as invoking the callback so the flow continues even if callbacks throw exceptions"
