   "use --run_post_scan to start the mass-check slaves. this fixes two bugs, namely: (1) sometimes the scan stage takes 3 hours, which was simply too long for mass-check --client to sanely sleep for; (2) some mass-check corpora don't contain any messages up to date, so the scan stage would exit with 'no messages to process' -- but the clients were already running and would stay running, idle, for 6 hours.  using --run_post_scan to start the slaves works around both problems.  Also, reduce the conn_retries timeout back down to a sane hour, now that we don't have to wait for it necessarily"
