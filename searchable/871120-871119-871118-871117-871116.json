   "Merge the dont-save-plaintext-passwords-by-default branch into trunk.", 
   "Summary of the functionality implemented:", 
   "- Add a 'store-plaintext-passwords' option, which can be set to", 
   "'yes', 'no', or 'ask' (which is the default). If the option", 
   "is set to 'ask', ask the user before saving plaintext passwords", 
   "to disk. This is done from a callback that should be implemented", 
   "by all clients. The callback is called once per authentication realm.", 
   "If a client does not implement the callback, and does not provide", 
   "an explicit default value, we default to storing plaintext passwords.", 
   "I don't like this, but it's a compromise because we don't really want", 
   "the semantics of the old API to change retroactively.", 
   "We can, however, change this default anytime by tweaking a single", 
   "line of code, should we decide to do so. The old API has been deprecated.", 
   "- Provide an implementation of the callback for our command line", 
   "client, which, in addition to prompting, prints a warning explaining", 
   "that the password can only be stored unencrypted, and shows the name", 
   "of the authentication realm in question.", 
   "- Authentication parameter configuration has been moved to the", 
   "RA layer completely. For users, this means that parameters", 
   "which used to be configured in the [auth] section in the 'config'", 
   "file are now configured in the 'servers' file, and can be specified", 
   "both in the [global] section, and per server group. The [auth]", 
   "section in 'config' is still being evaluated, but is overridden", 
   "by anything specified in 'servers'.", 
   "Please consult the log messages of the branch for a detailed list", 
   "of all changes."
