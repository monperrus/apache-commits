   "This patch fixes derbynet/testSecMec.java  test failure on 131 vms.",

   "-- the first getConnection works ok", 
   "-- but on the second getConnection, a SQLWarning needs to be generated  to say that the database already exists and in this scenario, it seems like at the point where it is creating a SQLWarning , there is a deadlock. The call to SQLWarning constructor does not return. On doing a java core dump , the thread in question seems to be in a wait state (conditional wait).  Guess is it has to do with the driver manager lock",
