   "[MNG-3057] Switch from model-object interpolation to String-based selective interpolation of the POM XML contents, to avoid problems reading/writing XML that contains comments (due to XPP3 model reader/writer). New approach uses two-stage interpolation, where first isolates XML version elements and hands off to second stage, which interpolates the value. Finally, bumping wagon version to 1.0-beta-5 to reflect this release."
