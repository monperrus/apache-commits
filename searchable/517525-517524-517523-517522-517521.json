   "Put in less buggy setVisibleAttribute() method; now it just moves the table offscreen---it was seeming-impossible to get decent behaviour across browsers when an initially-hidden table was desired, the browser seemed to need to have the object visible, if not on-screen, when it was setting it up.  If it was invisible, would often miss all but the last column when the table's visibility were restored."
