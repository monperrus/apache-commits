   "SyncWaitDelay*Test is failing spuradically with a management port clash. Simplest solution here is to disable the management interface for these tests. The more complex change to ensure the MC is shut down correctly and port freed during test startup will not be a problem for production. It only occurs here as we start a broker then stop and start a new one immediately."

   "fixed problem that pending uninstalled bundles waiting for deps will be started as soon as the deps are available. That led to an exception that the bundle was already uninstalled. Now the file monitor is watching for bundle uninstall events and will remove those bundles from the list of pending bundles."
