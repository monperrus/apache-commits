   "\"Actually, now I'm considering reverting back to the version without a public clear() method. The rationale is that this would be less complex and more consistent with the AnalyzerUtil design (simple methods generating simple anonymous analyzer wrappers). If desired, you can still (re)use a single static \"child\" analyzer instance. It's cheap and easy to create a new caching analyzer on top of the static analyzer, and to do so before each document. The old one will simply be gc'd.\""
