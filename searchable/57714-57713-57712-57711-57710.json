   "our existing users - nothing prevents us from fixing this going forwards.", 
   "This change allows us to locate APR 0.9 and 1.0 binaries and libraries", 
   "in the same tree structure, as an added bonus.  It would also allow the", 
   "APR library to be installed in a common location, such as \\windows\\system32,",
