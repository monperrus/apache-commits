   "Completely eliminated lookahead. SwitchingWrapper now simply points to the current node (corresponding to the current event) and the next node is only calculated when XMLStreamReader#next() is called (and no longer in advance). The algorithm is now as simple as one would expect: we traverse the tree in document order and if caching is disabled and we get past the last node created by the builder we switch to pull through mode."
