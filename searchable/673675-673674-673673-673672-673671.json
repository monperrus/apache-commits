   "Moved jetspeed application dependencies from the Jetspeed application project (applications/jetspeed) to a separate applications project \"jetspeed-dependencies\". This results in an empty lib dir of the Jetspeed application WAR (application/jetspeed). So this WAR essentially becomes a a \"resource\" WAR. The WAR can be used as an overlay for a custom project. To get the right runtime dependencies for a custom project, the jetspeed-dependencies (type POM) artifact has to be specified in the project's POM. The jetspeed-archetype artifact was changed to reflect the new situation.", 
   "The advantage of separating the Jetspeed WAR dependencies is that the dependencies POM can be used to get the right compile time dependencies for a custom project (without having to redefine deps/versions), which can be useful in case of extensions on top of Jetspeed. Another advantage is that double JARs are avoided, which was caused by Maven not seeing the JARs in the lib dir of the Jetspeed WAR."
