   "Now the initiator sessions are created at startup if all the necessary settings are specified in the FIX configuration files.", 
   "Most of the changes are done to the FIXSessionFactory class. A new method createFIXInitiaotr(AxisService) was added and it is called from the transport listener at the startup. Couple of utility methods were added to the FIXUtils class to support new functionality.",
