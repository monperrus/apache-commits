   "TIKA-126: Add Parser.parse(InputStream, Metadata) for metadata extraction", 
   "Reverted this feature.", 
   "The potential gains from this extra method are limited as most parser implementations will in any case need to parse the entire document even if they are just extracting metadata.", 
   "We can consider restoring this feature when we have more compelling use cases. For now I think we should rather keep the Parser interface as clean and simple as possible."
