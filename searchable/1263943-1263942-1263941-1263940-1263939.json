   "Fixing up MobileItemRenderer and List to better deal with 5-way support.  Now when someone presses Enter, the caretted item will be selected when inputMode == \"touch\".  When figuring out 5-way support for real, this will probably change, but I put this in for now.  I also changed MobileItemRenderer to not draw the separators when it's the caretted item.  Once we get a real XD spec on how item renderers should look (and how 5-ways support for them works/looks), this will change.", 
   "Also modified TrackBase so that if we're in touch inputMode, the track isn't selectable.  More work needs to be done here around the thumb and touch scrolling interaction, so this is just a start.",

MobileItemRenderer is still based on UIComponent and is in charge of drawing the background and has a single text component.

I'm also moving both of these classes in to the mobilecomponents project and mapping them in the spark manifest so that developers can now use them.",
