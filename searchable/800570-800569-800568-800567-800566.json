   "OPENJPA-1107 Updated TraversableResolver that calls only our OpenJPAPersistenceUtil.  Updated OpenJPAPersistenceUtil.isLoaded() to handle UnsupportedOperationException when checking a detached entity and returns LoadState.UNKNOWN.  Also added a testcase in TestPersistenceUtil to verify that caller gets isLoaded()==true for a detached entity and fixed a trace output in TestConstraints."
