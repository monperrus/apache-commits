   "QPID-1942: initial Queue/Exchange/Connection selection work.", 
   "Only remove items from the navigation tree config file if removal initiated by the user, not if caused by mbean unregistration. Notify MBeanView explicitly when mbeans are unregistered because new Queue etc selection allows opening Queues etc without adding to the navigation tree, so the previous tree selectionListener is no longer sufficient on its own. Add new refresh method to MBeanView to decouple it from the display of new mbeans based on tree selection, to allow viewing and refreshing mbeans not in the navigation tree."
