   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3077 - ArraysIndexOutOfBoundsException : -32768 in \"BrokerService[xxx] Task\" thread - brokerInfo and peerBroker infro explosion problems. A peer is a oneway relationship with networks, broker infos were being accumulated in duplicate for each connector and for multiple connectors. The peer broker info was maintained for each which caused the problem marshalling. re: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2632 - the configuration is now respected so it can be selectively enabled and rebalance only occurs if we randomly choose an alternative. The nested peer broker info is not propagated in a connection control"
