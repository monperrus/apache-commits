   "Extended ParseableFacet to include an editableTitleOf(NakedObject), and renamed titleOf(NakedObject) to displaytitleOf(NakedObject).  Also made NakedObjectSpecification search up its hierarchy for non-noop facets if cannot find any of type.  In addition, JavaIntrospector no longer requires the classes or interfaces that it introspects to be public (was causing issues trying to demonstrate use of 3rd party library as a value type, and doesn't seem to break anything...)"
