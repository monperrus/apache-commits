   "Added support for the more flexible method matching provided by MethodUtils.invokeMethod. It is possible that in some (relative obscure) circumstances, the extra precision of the original method is required and so a property has been added which allows the user to choose which one to use. More flexible method matching is enabled by default (there is a slight possibility that some existing code will be broken by this). Also created test cases."
