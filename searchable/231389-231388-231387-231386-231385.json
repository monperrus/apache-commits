   "fix for 36110 - LocalVariableGen calls setStart and setEnd which add 'this' to a hashset. The problem is that the hash is computed using start and end. since start wasn't computed until after it is added, the add hash and remove hash will be different. Changed ctor to stuff the start and end values before calling setStart and setEnd"
