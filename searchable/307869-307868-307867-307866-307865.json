   "A rather large commit focused on improved performance of batch inserts into the tablemodel, better support for sorting, cyclic buffer/unlimited toggling and getting rid of the annoying -blink- when rows are added as much as possible.", 
   "- added sort support for most all columns, including mdc columns (required passing in the column name to the columncomparator)", 
   "- revamped cyclictablemodel tablemodel event firing logic to only generate firexxx events when the batch is complete", 
   "- modified eventcontainer to provide the index of the last inserted event (needed to better handle cyclic buffer event firing), a more intelligent table event firing mechanism when inserting events in batch, and to add better support for sorting", 
   "- removed unused filterchangedlistener", 
   "- updated cyclicbufferlist to return the index of last insert (needed for batch inserts)", 
   "- updated displayed values in table for mdc and properties to show name and values"
