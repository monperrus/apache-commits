   "More simplification attempts:", 
   "1) Removed MatrixSIS.isIdentity(double tolerance) and setToIdentity() because a search in Geotk code base has", 
   "shown that those methods were rarely used, and when used they could be replaced by more efficient code path.", 
   "In particular, the 'setToIdentity()' method name was problematic because it was inappropriate for non-square", 
   "matrices. Removing this method avoid us the need to invent a new name.", 
   "2) Renamed (again) 'setToTranspose()' to a plain 'transpose()' because we had no other remaining 'setTo*' methods", 
   "in MatrixSIS, and we presume that developers who want the transpose operation will look for the \"transpose\" name.", 
   "There is a slight risk of misleading name since this method performs the operation in-place, but the fact that", 
   "the return type is 'void' should help to avoid errors.", 
   "3) In test cases, initialize the random number generator and the matrix size in the class constructor instead than", 
   "in an 'initialize' method. This avoid the need to put defensive code against multiple initializations."
