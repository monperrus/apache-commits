   "Log the context classloader before and after invoking the JAXWS endpoint.  This helps identify issues where the classloader may be changed during invocation.  That is important because JAXB contexts are based on the classloader, and if the classloader is changed that could cause problems related to not being able to find the correct JAXB Context to marshall responses.  Add associated test for the log message."
