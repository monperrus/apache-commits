Bug fix: in checking element-element collision in schema 1.1 UPA, need to make sure the 2 element's substitution groups don't overlap, because the same element can have multiple substitution affiliations. e.g. if \"e\" substitutes both \"a\" and \"b\", then (a|b) should be marked as UPA violation."
