   "Fixed single last unit test bug. Although LDAP tests won't work if a test LDAP server isn't running, all other unit tests run 100% clean. This is the first time that has happened in at least a year. Test times: 7 minutes 51 seconds for 1024 tests. Added Ant script to start OpenLDAP test fixture if available. Fixed JCRWikiPage bug that was causing JCR exceptions when attributes were not set."
