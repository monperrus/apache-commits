   "Fixes STANBOL-821: (1) tokens with low POS tag probabilities do now correctly check MinTokenSize (because of that the '\u00b4' or 'Poor\u00b4s' will no longer be a matchable token (2) Backwards label matches now correctly set the lastFoundProcessableToken index if this was not yet set by the forward label match process. (3) The search for additional matchable Tokens now correctly prefers tokens after the current position. NOTE that (3) is not related to STANBOL-821 but was noticed/fixed during that work"
