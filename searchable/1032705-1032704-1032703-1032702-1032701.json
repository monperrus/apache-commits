   "Sets the Host field on the v1.1+ Connect Frame.", 
   "Tweaks the Frame's keep alive send a bit more.", 
   "Updates the Inactivity monitor to better log its state and to no send the keep alive through its own Oneway method which was causing it to miss every other KeepAliveInfo send.  Also sets the Inactivity read check to use a generous window since Apollo seems to take twice as long as you ask it to send you a KeepAlive."
