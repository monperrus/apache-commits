   "* A recent change cause the FileSystemConfigurator to ignore an \"axis2.xml\" that was in the specified repository on the SimpleHTTPServer command line.  Fix this so that the FSC looks first for a specific filename passed as a constructor arg, then for a file named per the \"axis2.xml\" system property, and then for \"axis2.xml\" in the repository directory.", 
   "* The TransportDeploymentTest wasn't actually testing the FileSystemConfigurator correctly.  Since it was looking for the \"http\" transport, the fact that it was actually getting its configuration from the axis2.xml on the classpath was obscured.  Changing this to \"custom\" (and adding the transport deployment to the XML file) now confirms that the correct file is being processed, and the test passes due to the above change.", 
   "* When there's a problem figuring out the transport in ClientUtils, produce more useful errors."
