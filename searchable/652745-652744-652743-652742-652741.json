   "[SUREFIRE-474] Allow TestNG to use its built-in HTML Reporter.  TestNG's reporter works only at test time, so we just enable the default HTML reports at runtime, but allow the user to manually disable them with the usedefaultlisteners option.  Special case for TestNG 4.7, which drops its default XML files in the surefire-reports directory inappropriately; in that case, usedefaultlisteners is false by default."
