   "[UIMA-1722] Change CasCreationUtils part where to get metadata info, it instantiates (produceResource) a resource, gets the meta data info, and then destroys the resource - to cache these for 30 -60 seconds, to avoid repeatedly doing this for the same resource, since it can be very expensive (e.g., if the resource is a \"custom Resource Specifier\" used to denote a UIMA-AS remote service, this entails setting up a connection to that remote resource, and querying it, etc.). The short timeout insures that if a service becomes available, it won't be too long before the CDE would notice this ...", 
   "Change CDE to increase the odds of reusing things (like the class loader built for the particular project / datapath), and reducing the number of times it requests getting the metadata.", 
   "These two changes greatly speed up CDE opening when it has references to remote async services."
