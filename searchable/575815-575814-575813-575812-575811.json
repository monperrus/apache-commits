   "QPID-531 : NO_ACK fix. Added a decrementReference in SubscriptionImpl after the message has been sent. This was previously done inside dequeueMessage() but when the reference counting was reworked earlier in the year it was moved out of that method.. but all the uses of dequeueMessage were not evaluated. The existing AckTest didon't detect this error as it only occurs with persistent messages which the client sends by default. The AckTest however only tests transient messages. Updated Test for NO_ACK raised JIRA QPID-602 to cover updating the rest of the AckTests", 
   "(Updated log to show correct JIRA QPID-531 not QPID-573)"
