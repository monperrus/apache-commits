   "FELIX-4454 Online manipulator should be able to take advantage of Stereotypes", 
   "* Use the new manipulator-bom", 
   "* Moved AnnotationLiteral into the spi package (seems more logical to group class usable from modules)", 
   "* Changed the Module API a bit (module still have to implement the configure() method, but the container do not call that method itself (avoid multiple invocations leading to duplicate bindings))", 
   "* Introduced ModuleProvider interface for Pojoization to normalize the way modules are given to the manipulator", 
   "* Refactored a bit the 'ipojo:' UrlHandler (use of annotation + logservice)", 
   "* Provided a dedicated ResourceStore that search for annotation bytecode in all available bundles", 
   "* Added IT tests to ensure that services modules are accessible and that annotation bytecode is usable"
