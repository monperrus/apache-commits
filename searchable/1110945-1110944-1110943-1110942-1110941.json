   "Updated reification to distinguish between the \"hidden triples\" (which", 
   "don't appear in the parent graph) and \"reification triples\" (the", 
   "quadlets which might). We can then say that the hidden triples are", 
   "disjoint from the parent triples. [As Craig pointed out, this can be", 
   "useful, and indeed will be used shortly ...]", 
   "Also added some extra tests to AbstractTestReifier, including checking", 
   "that the reifier's style is the same as that passed to the graph", 
   "creating it, which forced its implementation in the DB reifier."
