   "Check the 'APR_POOL_DEBUG_LOG' for an alternative to stderr for debugging pools.  I found this very helpful when trying to debug things that detach from the tty, like httpd when not running with -DONE_PROCESS.  If 'APR_POOL_DEBUG_LOG' is not set, the original behavoir of spewing out on stderr is maintained."
