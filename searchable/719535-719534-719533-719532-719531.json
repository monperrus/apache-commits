   "Jeroen Hoffman provided thie patch after he discovered some code in JetspeedSerializerApplicationImpl from the db-tools subproject that is not working, when command line arguments are parsed. First, at one point there is an \"else if\" needed instead of an \"if\" and second, the checks and the actual command afterwards need to go outside of the argument parsing loop.",
