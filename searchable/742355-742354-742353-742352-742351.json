   "Added new allow-html tag on the attribute, auto-attribute, and override elements; has 3 options: none, safe, and any; the comments in the XSD file describe what each of these do; the important thing to know is that none is the default meaning no html is allowed; if html is needed use safe and look at the antisamy-esapi.xml file to see policy details; in extreme trust cases use any where any html is allowed; note that many services need updating which should allow at least safe html, and it may take some time to discover all of those and get them handled; please send in issues and requests for service attributes that should allow safe html"

   "Changed so that header links for profile, order history, etc are shown when user is not logged in, but not shown when user is anonymous; in some cases it is nice to not show links a user can't use, but in this case they are convenient as the system will simply ask the user to login before showing them the page, so they are better there than not"
