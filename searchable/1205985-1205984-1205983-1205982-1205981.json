   "Update the Relesae FAQ with a section on approving a release and link to that from the 'what is a release' section. I don't know the procedure for updating this FAQ so appologies in advance if i need to ask somewhere first. The website seemed to imply that it was CTR, even if that is the case i would have prefered to discuss this change somewhere first as its my first update to the FAQ, presumably someone watching the commit list will tell me the correct procedure (or even tell me if this is the correct file to update to modify the release FAQ)"
