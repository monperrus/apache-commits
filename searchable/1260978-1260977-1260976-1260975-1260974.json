   "If the source image doesn't support an alpha channel (ex. JPEG), then I need to copy the source into a new bitmapData object that supports transparency. This occurs one time in the source setter.", 
   "If the alpha or source has changed, then I need to copy the source into a new bitmapData. The reason is that using the BitmapData.colorTransform function is cumulative. Once I've applied an alphaMultiplier to it, there is no way to restore the alpha. I've optimized the code a bit to only copy the bitmapData if needed. For example, if we have already copied the data to add the transparent pixel border (to prevent the streaking effect on a non-repeating fill), then we forgo the copying.",

   "More work to support FXG 2.0 in the MXML Graphics library.", 
   "1. Switch blendMode default from layer to normal. Before, we did some trickery under the covers, where even though the default blendMode was layer, we actually only set it to layer when it resulted in a rendering difference (ie: when alpha was > 0 < 1 and other overlapping cases). Now, FXG 2.0 mandates blendMode default is normal \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to do that trickery because the FXG exporters are smarter and will set blendMode explicitly to layer when necessary. This change is for Group and all graphic primitives.", 
   "2. I\u2019ve added new enumerations to blendMode and maskType as well as a couple of new properties as mandated by FXG 2.0. There is additional work that needs to happen there that I\u2019ll be doing next week.",

   "5. I\u2019ve deprecated BitmapFill\u2019s \u2018repeat\u2019 property. I\u2019ve added a \u2018resizeMode\u2019 property to BitmapFill with the same enumerations, defaults and behavior as BitmapImage.
