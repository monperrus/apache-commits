   "JIRA Issue #1398: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1398. Fixing a usually slow growing memory leak. When a UTF-8, UTF-16, UCS-2 or UCS-4 byte sequence crosses a buffer boundary we call the read() method on the RewindableInputStream. This was always buffering the value returned from the underlying InputStream in the data array even when it will never be read again. For a well behaved InputStream if this occurred on every buffer of a 2 GB document we'd grow the data array to over 1 MB. A pathological InputStream which always returns only a few bytes at time could have caused the memory to be burned much quicker."

   "TS-157: Added four missing files, and also renamed StatTypes to StatAPITypes, to avoid reusing a filename that is already used in proxy/mgmt2/stats/. If someone objects, please feel free to rename these files again, I just find it confusing having two very similar files with the same names in two different directories."
