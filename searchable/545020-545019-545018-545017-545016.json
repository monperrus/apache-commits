   "TRINIDAD-46: Checkpoint for PPR via XMLHttp", 
   "- All the important functionality seems to be working fine at this point, including redirect on navigation and error reporting", 
   "- The PPRResponseWriter is installed by the RenderKit, and theoretically we therefore don't even require body or panelPartialRoot for PPR", 
   "- However, <body> is currently setting up some JS (in onload) that is otherwise not initialized at all, so panelPartialRoot is probably broken.", 
   "- PPR on PDAs (esp. PocketIE) is probably broken, and is definitely untested", 
   "- PPR on Portal is not supported, but it wasn't before either", 
   "- Cleaned up Core.js to remove a lot of old cruft", 
   "- Needed to enhance ReduceJavascriptMojo to copy .js files recursively, instead of just in the top directory"
