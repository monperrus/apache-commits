   "Implemented first draft of fix for TAPESTRY-1278 && TAPESTRY-1274.", 
   "-) Added new \"seedids\" hidden form field parameter that contains current state of IdAllocator.", 
   "-) Refactored FormSupport to use IRequestCycle IdAllocator instance so that all components in the render are guaranteed a unique id.", 
   "-) Added toExternalForm and fromExternal to IdAllocator class.", 
   "-) Removed all usages of FormSupportFactory as that concept is no longer necessary.", 
   "-) Fixed broken pom versions in VLIB/VlibBeans as a result of whoever upped the snapshot version not checking these sub-projects.", 
   "-) Added utility class CompressedDataEncoder which works similar to how the pagedataencoder compressed and encodes page data state for inclusion in URLS or hidden form input fields.", 
   "-) Made FormSupportImpl re-initialize the RequestCycle IdAllocator instance to the seeded id state that was originally encoded with the form being rewound to gurarantee consistent id state for form submissions."
