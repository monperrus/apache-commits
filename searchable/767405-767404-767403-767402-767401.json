   "CAMEL-1554, CAMEL-1551: Removed interceptor that was used and from an end user perspective confused what it was used for. HandleFault is now a interceptor strategy to be similar as tracer etc. Can be enabled on the camel context, just like tracer. And importantly aligned how the route is build whether JMX is enabled or not. JMX should not cause a difference."
