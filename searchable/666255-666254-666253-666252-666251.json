   "Removed the fix made for CXF-1639. (Now we add Strings as keys to the WSDLDefinition Map). From the code it looks like we are never putting literal Strings as keys in maps on client or server side. So the leak could be because of something else. We need to profile again and see whether the issue is still there and if so why. Leaving the issue open till then."
