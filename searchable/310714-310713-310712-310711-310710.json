   "- Updated LogFilePatternReceiver to rely on a URL for the file location instead of a file name (fileName param replaced with fileURL)",

   "- Updated width and label of 'automatic configuration' app preference to explicitly show it is a URL", 
   "- Updated height of app preferences frame to show all fields completely",
