   "* in the validation error message, show the value on which the validation failed (translations need updating)", 
   "* always use the normal convertor. I don't know plain convertor was used by default, maybe in earlier times selection lists encoded their value always as plain? Anyway, I don't see how this could ever have worked for valuetypes where the plain convertor isn't the default (or very similar)."
