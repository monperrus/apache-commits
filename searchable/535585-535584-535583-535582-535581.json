   "CXF-636: Support handleMessage() returns false on  server side inbound per JAX-WS spec. When handleMessage() returns false on  server side inbound, we stop the current incoming interceptor chain, create an outbound interceptor chain, set the response message to be the message processed by handleMessage. Note there are still sth need to be figured out in order to be 100% JAX-WS spec compliant, currently handleMessage() were called three times on the server side, the first time was called by inbound, the second time was called by invokeReversedHandlerMessage, the third time was called by outbound interceptor chain. This needs to be fixed."
