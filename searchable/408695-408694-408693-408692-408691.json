   "Big update for bringing Fusion in line with the latest Jetspeed-2 (2.1-dev for now):", 
   "- bump version to 1.6.1-dev", 
   "- replace the ackward embedded \"entity reference\" solution for resolving deps with plain property definitions and embedding the previously external deps now directly", 
   "- for Fusion, use jetspeed-2 plugin generated maven project definitions", 
   "- updated Fusion to integrate the latest Jetspeed-2 functionality and removed obsolete code like the cps package", 
   "- updated Jetspeed-1 embedded hsqldb version and demo script to 1.8.0.2 as that's what Jetspeed-2 requires (as minimum) and mixing with 1.7.1 isn't possible"
