   "Changes needed for QPID-2029 (Clustering and Management don't work well together)", 
   "This update changes the indexing of object IDs in the broker-resident management agent", 
   "from being based on the QMFv1 format (numeric) to the QMFv2 format (string name).  This removes", 
   "the need for numeric objectIds to be synchronized across a set of clustered brokers.", 
   "Also included in this patch is a fix to a bug in binding creation.  Previously, when a binding", 
   "was created that already existed, the management object for the proposed binding (duplicate of", 
   "the existing one) was created then destroyed.  This is inefficient and causes problems when the", 
   "name-based indexes collide."
