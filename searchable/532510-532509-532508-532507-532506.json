   "\"transparent\" FromLists; see code comments for details).",

   "4. Modifies ResultSetNode.setResultToBooleanTrue() to always return \"this\".", 
   "5. Modifies SetOperatorNode.setResultToBooleanTrue() so that it now creates", 
   "an internal \"SELECT *\" query whose FROM list contains just the", 
   "SetOperatorNode. Then we transform the \"*\" for the new SELECT into \"TRUE\"",
