   "Updated the io transport to use a separate write thread with a circular buffer that does opportunistic write batching. Fixed error handling and shutdown for the io transport. Switched default from mina to the io transport for the 0-10 client. Modified InputHandler to accumulate bytes in the outer loop and simplified the state machine accordingly. These changes should address QPID-1188, prevent the Java client from running out of memory when writing messages faster than the network and/or broker can keep up, and in general improve performance."
