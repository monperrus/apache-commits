   "ARIES-440 Fixes for the following:", 
   "1. The core does the following:", 
   "i) Find an ICF service", 
   "ii) Get ICF", 
   "iii) Create a Context", 
   "iv) release ICF service", 
   "v) return Context", 
   "This means that the ICF cannot manage the lifecycle because it doesn't know when the context is finished with. We should only release the service when the context has been closed.", 
   "2. We do a lot of queries, which is kind of expensive. If we used a service tracker we could remove all the queries and it would be more efficient and perform some amount better.", 
   "3. Got some things wrong on ARIES-417. e.g.", 
   "ii) The URLObjectFactoryFinder doesn't get the environment, so it can't do things based on the JNDI environment, this is bad.", 
   "I would have liked to separate these things out more, but I managed to get my changes tangled. Need to take more care next time."
