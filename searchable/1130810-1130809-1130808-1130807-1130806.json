   "Remove use of stream mark/seek features from svn patch.", 
   "The patch code needs an abstraction for patching both file and property", 
   "content in a seamless manner. This abstraction was previously provided", 
   "by streams and the mark/seek feature. This commit replaces use of streams", 
   "with a custom read/write/seek/tell callback interface added to the", 
   "target_content_info_t structure which is private to the patch code.", 
   "As a bonus, the new implementation patches properties entirely in memory.", 
   "The old code used to patch property values within temporary files and", 
   "then read those files back into memory, which is somewhat pointless.", 
   "* subversion/libsvn_client/patch.c", 
   "everywhere: Update docstrings and comments to match the new implementation.", 
   "(target_content_info_t): Major revamp. New members: EXISTED, READLINE,", 
   "READLINE_BATON, TELL, SEEK, WRITE, WRITE_BATON (most are callback types).", 
   "Removed: PATCHED, REJECT (the latter has moved into patch_target_t),", 
   "and POOL (this was unused).", 
   "(prop_patch_target_t): New members: VALUE, PATCHED_VALUE for storing", 
   "properties as strings in memory. Remove PATCHED_PATH.", 
   "(patch_target_t): Replace PATCHED and REJECT streams with PATCHED_FILE", 
   "and REJECT_FILE files. Remove POOL (not sure why this was even here).", 
   "(prop_read_baton_t, readline_prop, tell_prop, seek_prop, write_prop): New.", 
   "(readline_file, tell_file, seek_file, write_file): New.",

   "items and drop anything related to removed items.",

   "Drop anything not needed with the new interface. Take care not to change", 
   "existing semantics for callers.", 
   "(install_patched_target): Perform keyword expansion and EOL translation", 
   "while installing patched file in the working copy. This used to be done", 
   "on the fly be wrapper streams, but we don't have those anymore.", 
   "(install_patched_prop_targets): Take advantage of the fact that props", 
   "are now being patched entirely in memory."
