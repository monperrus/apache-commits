   "[UIMA-477] Adam pointed out it would be good to include the core framework .xml files as candidates for import by name - for instance, he needed to include the default fixed flow controller in order to override some parameters.  I changed the computation of the class path, which normally filters out the core framework (because you can't have that there for the other use of this, which is to set up the UIMA extension class loader), to optionally not do this for this purposed call.", 
   "I also changed the POM to include a bundle java level requirement (of 1.5) in hopes of generating a better error message if you accidentally run Eclipse with Java 1.4 and then try to use the CDE.  Unfortunately, Eclipse still gives very obscure errors for this."
