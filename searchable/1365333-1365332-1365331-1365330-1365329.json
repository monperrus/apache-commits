   "[FUNCTOR-12] Added more tests for the generator classes (and util classes). Also removed unreachable code, as it could not be tested and was immutable and created/validated during construction. Tests that were using a try/catch + fail() approach were updated to use @Test(expected=SomeClass.class). Test classes missing $revision and $data svn tags were updated too."

   "[FUNCTOR-12] Added more tests to core composite classes. Also removed unreachable code, as it could not be tested and was immutable and created/validated during construction. Tests that were using a try/catch + fail() approach were updated to use @Test(expected=SomeClass.class). There was one class with tests in JUnit 3 format that weren't being executed by JUnit 4, it was corrected by adding @Test to its methods. And new classes were added for classes not covered (the license header was copied from other classes)."
