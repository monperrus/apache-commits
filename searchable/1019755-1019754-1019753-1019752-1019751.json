   "introduced isTransient and isPersistent into the NakedObject interface, and using it instead of delegating to the NakedObject's ResolveState.  Academic reason is: no longer violating law of demeter; Practical reason is: the embedded runtime's version of NakedObject no longer needs to worry about ResolveStates, so makes for simpler API.  NB: also introduced a NakedObjectMM supertype which identifies the methods of NakedObject used by the metamodel; those remaining in NakedObject are only ever used by the framework module or higher"
