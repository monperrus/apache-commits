   "Added support for reading the OS/2 table's usWeightClass value which supports the same font weight values as we use in XSL-FO.", 
   "However, in my tests these values proved to be unreliable (like ExtraBlack fonts returning 400). I just hooked the whole thing in so this work isn't lost if anyone has an idea to make it work. The FontInfoFinder will continue to only use guessed font weights for now."
