   "refactored the UDP transport to push most of the code and logic back into the transport layer itself.", 
   "* Command how has transient from & to properties which can be used with transports like UDP/multicast to indicate which endpoint (typically broker) actually sent the commands", 
   "* used int for commandId", 
   "* support for PartialCommand support; allowing large commands (such as big messages) to be split up into smaller chunks", 
   "* added a CommandJoiner for joining partial commands together into complete commands", 
   "* ReliableTransport which re-orders and can re-request missed commands"
