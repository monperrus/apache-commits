   "Downgraded log4j from 1.2.15 (latest) to 1.2.14.", 
   "Reason: 1.2.15 introduces additional transitive dependencies, some of which are not resolvable. For the build this can easily be addressed using an exclusion rule in the dependencyManagement entry for log4j. However, as Ruwan reported, this doesn't work with the IDEA Maven plugin, and I still see issues with the Eclipse plugin.", 
   "Note that log4j was upgraded to the latest version by Asankha in r748973, along with other dependencies. Since there is probably no particular reason to prefer 1.2.15 over previous versions, we should use 1.2.14 so that we can avoid cluttering the POM files with exclusions rules."
