   "SDK-24623 (Video doesn't stop when layer containing it is made non visibile and pauseWhenHidden=true): We now add a \"layerPropertyChange\" events to designLayers, if they exist.  We also check for designLayer.effectiveVisibility.",

This is just updating the ASDoc so people don't expect such events when the source gets set to null.  An OSMF bug has been filed for them to dispatch these events when the element gets set to null (or in the short-term, update their ASDocs in a similar fashion).",

   "SDK-24586 ([GUMBO_PRIORITY] scaleMode=\"none\" and scaleMode=\"zoom\" on VideoDisplay doesn't clip video to bounds): The underlying OSMF bug wasn't fixed, but they gave me a new approach to use RegionGateway for the viewing area rather than MediaPlayerSprite.",

   "When the source is null, the bindings on some of the properties (specifically currentTime, duration, bytesLoaded, and bytesTotal) should fire.  In VideoPlayer, if you look at videoDisplay_mediaPlayerStateChangeHandler(), we are already doing the correct thing in there to make sure our VideoPlayer object looks correct.  However, if someone just binds to these values, they should also update.  To fix this, I added [Bindable(\"mediaPlayerStateChange\")] on these properties.",
