   "IO-74 Refactor RegexFilter - add ability to construct instances with either pattern flags or case sensitivity. Also simplify by removing the array/list of String patterns constructors since adding all variants with flags/case sensitivity would be cumbersome and also the logic is limited to \"OR\" and some users may want \"AND\" - AND/OR logic can be achieved by combining RegexFilter instances using the AndFileFilter and OrFileFilter implementations."
