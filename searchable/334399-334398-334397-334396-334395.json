   "Fix bug reported by Krishna 01/30/2001 09:47 PM.", 
   "The bug is that values that were set by the", 
   "stylesheet were not overridden by the properties,", 
   "because a confusing function was called that is", 
   "also used for internal processing, which does", 
   "not override properties that are already", 
   "set (the function is used to process higher", 
   "precidence properties first, then lower precidence,", 
   "for various reasons).  The fix is fairly", 
   "straight-forward, the call that copies in the", 
   "stylesheet properties has to be done after the", 
   "copy from the caller's properties, instead of", 
   "before.", 
   "Also contains a minor change to executeChildren to", 
   "allow for the supression of xsl:attribute from xsl:element", 
   "when an element production needs to be ignored."
