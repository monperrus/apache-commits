   "First update with modifications to use true prepared statements (value = ?). Some further attention is probably needed to handle specific types in JdbcGeneralValueMapper#valueAsDBString(...). At the moment, I use instanceof clauses to get to the actual underlying data object. This is clumsy, as every class needs to be handled specifically. There should be a mechanism similar to that which sets the mapper type field (\"INT\", \"FLOAT\", etc).",
