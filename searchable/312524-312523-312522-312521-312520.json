   "'You cannot passwords when logging' is obviously wrong. I'm going to guess that it means 'You cannot change passwords' based on the rest of the text. I have also switched from 'logout and log back in' to 'logout and login again' to match another message that used that form instead. I chose the latter as the winner simply because I didn't like having logout joined but log and in separate, felt odd"
