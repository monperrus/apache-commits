   "This fixes a problem with the new recovery handling in ajp13.  The problem occurs when the user requests a page and presses stop before it is all back, and the protocol retries the request to the java backend.  Since there is data in the reply buffer already, the code assumes it is post data and sends it to the java side.  The data in the reply is still there and that gets passed around and eventually it shows up in the next request made by the browser;  i.e. if the previous request was to servlet foo1, a request to foo2 returns the response from foo1.  This should also fix the problem reported with frames displaying improperly (especially because of resets from the browser.)"
