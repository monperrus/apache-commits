   "add a few annotations in the spi-annotations project that we can use to annotate endpoints so that we can automatically generate HTML documentation for how to configure them; rather like maven goals work. See CAMEL-6304 for more details. The annotations are in a separate project, spi-annotations - as it makes APT+maven much happier that way; the annotations get included in camel-core as well"
