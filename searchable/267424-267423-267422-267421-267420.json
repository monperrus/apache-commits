   "Per discussion about supplying a working ant build.xml file.  This file gets generated by Maven when executing \"maven ant\".  However, since there are 3 repositories that our maven build pulls from, there is now way for Eclipse to know which one to use for a given dependency, so maven simply prepends the first one supplied (to the ant <get> command in the build.xml file).", 
   "Until all dependent jars can be hosted by a single remote repository, any generated ant build file will need to be tweaked by hand.", 
   "Rearranging these does not fix the problem, but simply makes for less work in the interim."
