   "Reduced our js warnings down to about 5.", 
   "This involved some stupid changes, like renaming vars that shouldn't need to be renamed but it also actually found 1 bug and got rid of some unused code.", 
   "I also put us back to version 0.6 of the compressor because of the duplicate var error. That error is extremely noisy and pretty meaningless. Hopefully we will simply find a better js compiler.", 
   "I will shoot to fix some of the remaining warnings in a bit."
