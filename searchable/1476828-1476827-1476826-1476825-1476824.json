   "A small overhaul for the ModelEntity class. The class is not thread-safe. Worse, there were four ModelField-related collections that were not updated consistently - causing invalid data. Two of the collections (field list and field map) were redundant, so I eliminated one.", 
   "This is a step toward thread-safety, but the class still isn't thread-safe. It would be best if this class was immutable, but that will require a lot of re-engineering."
