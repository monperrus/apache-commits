   "UIComponent: remove keepControlOfMouseDown, which was checked in accidentally", 
   "FocusManager: move a check for event.isPreventDefauled() from the mouseDown handler to the mouseFocusHandler.  It was probably accidentally added in the mouseDown handler in the first place since mousedown events were not prevent defaultable (they are now, though)", 
   "SystemManager: Make MouseDown events prevent defaultable.  We do this for mouseWheel handlers already.  This allows our components to communicate a little with regards to who's handling this event.  Currently only ButtonBase and ItemRenderer check for this.", 
   "Split up IconItemRenderer in to MobileItemRenderer and MobileIconItemRenderer.  MobileItemRenderer is still based on UIComponent and is in charge of drawing the background and has a single text component.  MobileIconItemRenderer will be a more complex item renderer that developers can use. I'm also moving both of these classes in to the mobilecomponents project and mapping them in the spark manifest so that developers can now use them.", 
   "ButtonBase and List: Clean up code around how we deal with touch scrolling and adding a delay to button.  We also make sure that if the Button was clicked quickly before the delay fires that we show the button in the down state for some minimum amount of time.", 
   "Scroller: clean up a lot of the touch scrolling code",
