   "Use jboss-j2ee-3.2.3.jar in replacement of the Sun j2ee jar. The advantage is that the JBoss jar can be distributed and is available on ibiblio.org. Thus it makes our build for J2EE 1.3 seamless. I still need to check whether we can redistribute it in our Cactus distribution. I think it should be ok as we've moved to the 2.0 Apache license."
