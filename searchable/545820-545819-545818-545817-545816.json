   "Fixes TAPESTRY-1554.  Instead of removing the description field just used it as the value in instances where the value is already a string.  Still need to go back to the exception reporters + template source line precise rendering to be sure the Location object column attribute is being used or has enough information to properly highlight the exact section of error.  More or less - it's better to use the existing line precise stuff and more intelligently find a good description \"on the fly\" than storing it permanently in every binding object in the system."
