   "First cut at having a programatic way to get the svn revision that a tuscany build is from. This approach seems a little conveluted so if anyone has a better approach please do say, this one uses the Maven buildnumber plugin to set a mvn property with the svn revision, which is then written into a message properties file with the antrun plugin, which is then used initilize a constant in a Version class. Not sure if it even actually works, committing it so i can get a Hudson build and check if it does end up with the correct value"
