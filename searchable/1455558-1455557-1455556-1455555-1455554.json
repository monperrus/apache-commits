   "AIRAVATA-782 Adding code for EC2 scheduling algorithm. This is a greedy algorithm which monitors CPU, memory utilization of running instances to schedule the next compute job. Based on the scheduling decision, the next job will run on the instance which is unter-utilized. These, are not yet being used by the Workflow Interpreter. Once, the UI components for EC2 are added to the trunk, we can integrate these to the Workflow Interpreter."
