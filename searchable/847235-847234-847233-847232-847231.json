   "* Some patches from Richard Lewis", 
   "- New command svn-status-mv to implement svn mv (bound to `R' as in dired)", 
   "- Added svn-log-edit-mode-hook (run when we enter svn-log-edit-mode)", 
   "- New variable svn-status-default-log-arguments: a string of arguments", 
   "for svn-status-show-svn-log when no prefixes are used.", 
   "- Fixed a bug in svn-status-update-buffer (a bracket was in the wrong", 
   "place, meaning `C-u g' included the last file twice)", 
   "- In 0.29.0 in the output of `svn status -v', \"Head revision\" changed", 
   "to \"status against revision\" breaking `C-u g'.  Also the order in", 
   "which files appear in the output of `svn status' is less predicatble", 
   "(expecially with a mixed revision working copy), so it is necessary", 
   "to sort the file-list before inserting it into the *svn-status*", 
   "buffer (otherwise files won't appear under their directories)", 
   "- Added more docstrings", 
   "- Added svn-status-examine-parent, svn-status-toggle-elide and", 
   "svn-status-mv to the menu.", 
   "- Make the localrev and lastchangedrev have width at least 4"
