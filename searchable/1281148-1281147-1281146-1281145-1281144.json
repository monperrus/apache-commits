   "1.\tThe source property treats an empty string the same as null (clears the current video). SWFLoader and ModuleLoader also treat empty strings the same as null.", 
   "2.\tThe second fix is for a memory leak caused by timers in OSMF\u2019s MediaPlayer. The fix is to turn off the timers when we are taken off stage and pauseWhenHidden is true. If the VideoPlayer should play when offstage (pauseWhenHidden == false) then we need to leave the timers running and the VideoPlayer could still leak. There is code to restore the timers when the VideoPlayer comes back on stage or if we try to load a video when offstage. Developers who set pauseWhenHidden to false will need to set the VideoPlayer source to null before closing a pop-up, module or sub-application that contains a VideoPlayer.",
