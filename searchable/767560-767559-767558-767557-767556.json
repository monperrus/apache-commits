   "PLUTO-554: fixed infinite invocation problem when a jsp page includes another jsp page.", 
   "Servlet spec requires the request attributes such as javax.servlet.include.servlet_path (SRV.8.3.1) should be replaced when the request is subsequently included.", 
   "So, I added kind of flag setting methods, setDispatching() and isDispatching() and add some lines in getAttribute() to make it behave as normal when it is dispatching to other.", 
   "Previously, the HttpServletPortletRequestWrapper uses the pre-stored path info for *some reason*. (I cannot figure out the reason(s) yet though.)", 
   "OTOH, PortletRequestDispatcherImpl has two pairs for include() and forward(). One pair is for portlet request/response and the other pair is for servlet request/response.", 
   "The methods for servlet request/response pair, include() and forward(), try to restore the path info after dispatching.", 
   "However, these two methods for servlet request/response pair do not seem to be invoked ever because containers like Tomcat uses its own RequestDispatcher implementation. (Maybe there're some use cases I'm missing.)", 
   "Anyway, I tried to fix the problem without making any side effects this time."
