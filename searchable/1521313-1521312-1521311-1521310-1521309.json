   "DERBY-6317 Optmizer can choose the wrong path when BTreeCostController.java returns an estimate cost and row count of 0.0", 
   "The Optimizer estimates do not handle well 0 row counts coming out of store.", 
   "These estimates end up getting multiplied by other estimates and the resulting", 
   "0 costs caused the incorrect plan to be picked in the repro included with",
