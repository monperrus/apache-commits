   "Add LogEvent.getContextMap(String) to support easy ports from Log4j version 1.2's getProperty(String) method. Since LogEvent.getContextMap() can return null, it is cumbersome to use since a null check is required for bullet-proof code, adding this 1-arg String method addresses the issue cleanly. getContextMap(String) is not a great method name, but getContextMapValue(String) seems weird and Log4j 1.2's getProperty(String) name does not fit."
