   "[jira][89-fb][HBASE-5776] HTableMultiplexer", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary:", 
   "There is a known issue in HBase client that single slow/dead region", 
   "server could slow down the multiput operations across all the region", 
   "servers. So the HBase client will be as slow as the slowest region", 
   "server in the cluster.", 
   "To solve this problem,  HTableMultiplexer provides a thread-safe non", 
   "blocking PUT API across all the tables.", 
   "Each put will be sharded in to different buffer queues based on its", 
   "destination region server. So each queue will only have the puts shared", 
   "the same destination. And each queue will have a flush worker thread to", 
   "flush the puts request to the region server.", 
   "All the puts will be retried as a configuration number before dropping.", 
   "And the HTableMultiplexer can report the number of buffered requests and", 
   "the number of the failed (dropped) requests in total or on per region", 
   "server basis.",
