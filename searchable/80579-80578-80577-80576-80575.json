   "Major Configure Cleanup",

   "1.  Now every Makefile receives a SRCDIR option which", 
   "is set to \".\", \"..\". \"../..\" etc. for the various subdirs and thus shows", 
   "the individual path to the root of our src/ directory.",

   "INCLUDES0 option which now reads ``INCLUDES0=-I$(SRCDIR)/os/unix", 
   "-I$(SRCDIR)/include''", 
   "[MAJOR CHANGE]", 
   "3.  Now replaced all locally defined INCDIR's with a globally", 
   "defined INCDIR=$(SRCDIR)/include", 
   "4.  Removed the TARGET option from all Makefiles (because it is", 
   "not needed there) except for the top-level one (where it is needed)", 
   "5.  Stripped confusing comments (##RULE..., etc.) and", 
   "consequently add Begin/End comments for the generated sections", 
   "6.  All Makefiles now contain a header with inheritance", 
   "information, i.e. from which files it was derived", 
   "7.  Subdirectory movement messages is now built-in for easier", 
   "following where the build process currently stays.", 
   "8.  All comments now have the same style in the Configure script.", 
   "9.  The Apache license header was added to the Configure script", 
   "10. Fixed a few bugs in Configure ([<space><tab>] vs. [<space><space>], etc.)", 
   "11. Tested under FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and SunOS to make sure no", 
   "new bugs were introduced. Hmmm....", 
   "[Re-run the Configure script!]"
