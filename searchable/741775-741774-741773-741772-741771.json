   "Add a smart pointer implementation to allow for sharing of command objects without over copying them due to lifetime constraints on command elements.  Refactored the codebase to use smart pointers in the Commands and in the Core classes.  This results in less copying of commands and their associated data whenever messages are sent and received.  Also allows for safely storing pointers to Command Id type objects in STL containers without worrying about their lifetime."
