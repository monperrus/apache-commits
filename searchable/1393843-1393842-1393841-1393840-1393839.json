   "[jira] [HBASE-6930] [89-fb] Fix TestThriftServerLegacy: notifyAll should be inside synchronized block, and a null checkAndMutate expected value should be handled correctly", 
   "Author: mbautin", 
   "Summary:", 
   "There were a couple of reasons why TestThriftServerLegacy has been failing recently in the HBase 89-fb branch:", 
   "- rHBASEEIGHTNINEFBBRANCH1393468 was calling notifyAll outside a synchronized block", 
   "- rHBASEEIGHTNINEFBBRANCH1391219 changed the meaning of a null expected value passed to checkAndMutate but that was not reflected in the Thrift handler",
