   "* junit dependency should have test scope. Exception: in rampart-integration, the code in src/main/java also depends on junit.",

   "* Removed dependencies on annogen, ant-nodeps and xalan.", 
   "* Replaced dependency on axis2-transports by dependencies on individual transport implementations so that maven can add the right transitive dependencies.", 
   "* Removed the explicit dependency on httpcore. This is now a transitive dependency contributed by axis2-transport-http.", 
   "* The dependency on org.opensaml:opensaml was declared twice: first using version 2.2.3 and then using version 1.1. Since Maven only keeps the last declared version, removed the dependency on 2.2.3.", 
   "* Removed dependencies on xml-apis and xercesImpl since the target platform is now Java 5. (Note that they still remain transitive dependencies)"
