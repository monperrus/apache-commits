   "Fixed sdk-16853, sdk-17341, sdk-16855, sdk-16681, sdk-16668, sdk-16851, sdk-16480. The main change is that the new Wait effect has gone away and its functionality (optionally waiting for an event) is instead merged into the old Pause effect. Some enhancements were added to Pause along the way. Also fixed other random effects issues, such as waiting to raise the effectStart event until after startDelay elapses (like the old Flex3 effect behavior).",
