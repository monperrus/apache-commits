   "Added code to xCAT.pm::load which updates reservation.lastcheck when progress is detected as a node is being loaded. It will update the value at most every 60 seconds. This is used by the parent process in a cluster request in new.pm::wait_for_child_reservations to detect when child reservations are still loading. Updating reservation.lastcheck will prevent the parent from timing out the request if the child takes significantly longer than the parent process took to load the node.",

   "Added additional looping to xCAT.pm::_rpower which makes additional attempts if a timeout error is encountered. Added ability to control number of rpower attempts via entries in the variable table: xcat|rpower_error_limit, xcat|timeout_error_limit"
