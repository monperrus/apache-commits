   "Fix the interaction of @MTOM and servers, so that it works for jaxws:server as well as jaxws:endpoint (cxf-1400). Make the threshold travel down to the jaxb attachment code (cxf-1401). Fix some spelling errors in the names of things. Push toward generating JavaScript that can process text/plain attachments via MTOM."
