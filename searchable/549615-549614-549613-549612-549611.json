   "fixing functional issue with multi-language blog support.  we haven't been properly enforcing the fact that the 'show all langs' option is tied to value of the 'enable multi-lang blogging' option.  i.e. that it only makes sense to disable 'show all langs' and force a blog view to 1 language at a time if 'enable multi-lang blogging' is enabled.", 
   "this commit includes a fix in the weblogConfig action to enforce this rule moving forward and it also includes a sql command for upgrading users to make sure that existing blogs are properly updated to enforce this."
