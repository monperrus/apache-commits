   "Fixed a bug in the RouteEngine service engine (engine=\"route\") where no ECAs were being triggered when running a route service asynchronously, this is caused because in general ECAs aren't triggered until a service is called synchronously but the RouteEngine was simply returning instead of doing a runSync on a separate thread.  Fixed this by changing the RouteEngine to extend the GenericAsyncEngine and letting it handle the async calls in the same way it does for other engines."
