   "QPID-2530 : Updated build system to have a new findSubProjects macro in build.xml that will correctly locate and add all subprojects (those with a build.xml file) to the modules.plugin variable. This will correctly allow new plugins to be automatically picked up without any further build system changes.", 
   "To further simplify the build process and make better use of the module.depends option the build.deps file has been updated to contain only the libraries the module actually depends on. The dependant libraries due to a module.depends are now automatically pulled in by the build system. A further enhancement would be to do transitive dependencies, which would also allow dependencies to be built when in a sub module directory.", 
   "e.g. client depends on common, but client.libs should not contain mina, common contains mina and so those libraries are pulled in via the fact that client's module.depends contains common."
