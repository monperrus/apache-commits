   "Contributed by Deepa Remesh.", 
   "Attaching a patch 'derby-514-patch2-runtest-v1.diff' which enables the upgrade test to run with the test harness.", 
   "Summary:", 
   "* findCodeBase method in harness/jvm.java is changed to public. This method is used by upgrade test to get the location of new jar files.", 
   "* Adds the other derby jars to the jar file list in UpgradeTester. This will allow the test to run in client framework. I tried running the test in client framework and it looks like this will need new master file and some more work.", 
   "* In UpgradeTester, File.toURL method is used when creating class loader. This seems to be a better way to construct the URL.", 
   "* Master file update", 
   "This patch combined with the previous patch (derby-514-buildfiles-v1.diff) will allow the upgrade test to be run using RunTest. The location of old jars has to be passed in as a property in jvmflags. Command to run:",
