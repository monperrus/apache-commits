   "Add a website for the scxml-eclipse project:", 
   "* The m2 POM is currently used purely for building the site, the dummy <build> section that skips compilation is introduced until we move to the logical multi-module build if possible and if there is interest", 
   "* Simple site.xml is added, can be improved as docs etc. become available as part of the site (for example, the ppt building tutorial should be converted to xdoc)", 
   "* A stub changes.xml is provided (TBD whether to maintain this)", 
   "* Basic homepage includes a blurb from the README", 
   "* Mailing list page via 'mvn commons:mail-page'", 
   "* Issue tracking page via 'mvn commons:jira-page' (note: we use the SCXML JIRA component, not sandbox)"
