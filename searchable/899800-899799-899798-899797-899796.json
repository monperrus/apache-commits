   "QPID-2137 : Update QpidTestCase to set QPID_WORK on the external broker based on the port of the running broker. This allows multiple brokers to be started by QTC with a given QPID_WORK value. Removed manual changing of QPID_WORK in FailoverBaseCase as there was no way to know what that value was later. All calls to startBroker in QTC will correctly append the port to the given QPID_WORK value. AcknowledgeOnMessageTest was updated to provide some extra debugging to help aid later investigation of why messages are not recieved after failover."
