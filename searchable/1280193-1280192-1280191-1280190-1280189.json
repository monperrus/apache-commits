   "Get scroll bars back.  Yesterday's rev 11652 which added an invalidateSize() call to the damageHandler interacts badly with a hack in measure() for the scroller to help it deal with resizes that sets _contentWidth and _contentHeight to 0.  It is possible that there will be a remeasure, but nothing needs to be composed so _contentWidth and _contentHeight are not updated and the scroller thinks scroll bars are needed.", 
   "Remove the code which set _contentWidth and _contentHeight to 0 added for SDK-22469. Much has changed in both RET and the scoller since this code was done.  I retested SDK-22469 and it looks good with the code removed and we have scroll bars back when they are needed.",

   "Spark now provides localized RTE messages for TLF.", 
   "TLF is a layer below Flex and doesn't have a localization scheme like Flex's ResourceManager; it just has hard-coded English RTE messages.

UIFTETextField didn't have class init code so I just do it repeatedly in the constuctor\u2026 it's just an assignment statement and should be fast enough.",
