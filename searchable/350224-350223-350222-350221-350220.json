   "cleaned up the code from not needed fragments. Added more comments to the classes, enhanced error message throwing and overall readablity of the code. Enhanced matching the state of the transformer, whether it is inside or outside of the structurer. With this it is now possible to have the structurer within other xml like <root><structurer/></root>. Moved helper classes to the dispatcherHelper."
