   "Fix for http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-1105 - Perf bottleneck with the number of calls from PageFlowPageFilter to get ActionServlet from ServletContext. As noted in the bug, a better, long term solution such as a caching layer should be implemented. For now, this will help relieve some of the contention for getting the ActionServlet from the ServletContext. The solution with this change tracks the module paths that do not have a module config and skips code paths that would try and register it.",
