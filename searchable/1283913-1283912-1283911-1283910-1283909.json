   "- Auto-fading logic was clobbering the state-specified value of alpha in some situations (and the logic was way complex and fragile, so a refactoring was needed).", 
   "- Animation now handles sorting of Resize animations to be processed first in each frame, to improve some of the Resize/transform-effect interaction.", 
   "- Post-layout translation animations were being automatically created in some situations, ignoring any startDelays set on the real translation animations. The fix was to pick up the real translation animation info to pre-populate the post-layout animations.",

   "Fixes div-by-zero bug. Some animation code made the wrong assumption that duration+repeatDelay would never be zero. It's perfectly valid to have zero-dur animations. This would cause incorrect calculations in the timing code, causing us to think that we were in some repetition cycle instead of actually having ended the current zero-dur Animation.",

   "-----------", 
   "Fixed bug in Animation where seeking to a playheadTime greater than the current or next repetition cycle would end the animation. There was old logic in the frame calculation method (doInterval()) that incremented the start time of the current repetition cycle when it detected a repeat, but this doesn't work if you are seeking to a random time in the animation. The fix was to correctly calculate the time factors based on the playheadTime, which works for both seeking and playing scenarios.",
