   "Made a number of improvements to Shindig integration: (1) moved gadget-widget conversion into a GadgetAdapter class that implements W3CWidget and takes a JSON object as its constructor, (2) gadget import generates a W3CWidget model object and doesn't do any persistence itself, this is left to the WidgetFactory class as is usual for other widget imports, (3) Doesn't import duplicate gadgets, (4) updated unit tests. See WOOKIE-52 for details."
