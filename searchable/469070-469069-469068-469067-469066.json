   "o Clean up JaxWsServiceFactory.setClassInfo and make it readable/fixable.", 
   "o Add MessagePartInfo.typeClass as we are almost always binding a part to", 
   "a class eventually. The only case when we are not is when we're doing", 
   "WSDL introspection (i.e. WSDL2Java), but it doesn't hurt things to have", 
   "get/setTypeClass there.", 
   "o Cleaned up JAXBDataBinding. Instead of walking the service model in it,", 
   "we utilize the service model to build up the context. This has the following", 
   "advantages:", 
   "1. Not tied to JAX-WS", 
   "2. Allows databinding of services which aren't backed by one class", 
   "3. Reduces code duplication", 
   "o You'll realize JAXBDatabinding has a Class... constructor now. This", 
   "does NOT walk classes anymore. It simply addes the classes to the context.", 
   "o I fixed up WSDLServiceBuilder a little bit so it set the XML schema,", 
   "part name, and element names correctly.", 
   "o Give the DataReader a MessagePartInfo so it can look at the generic type", 
   "and grab the class info itself.", 
   "o Reworked the RPC namespace handling a bit. The net output should be", 
   "the exact same, but if something looks off let me know.", 
   "o Add a LoggingInInterceptor", 
   "o Support returning/receiving List<Foo> now (which is the reason I did", 
   "all the above changes...)!"
