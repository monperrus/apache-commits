   "1. The most important reason for the patch is to allow more consistent use", 
   "of terminology. Without the patch TargetedChain is not strictly a Chain at", 
   "all (i.e. the TargetedChain interface doesn't extend the Chain interface),", 
   "so its name is rather misleading. Renaming TargetedChain to avoid referring", 
   "to Chain doesn't help as the concepts are so close. I believe that a", 
   "TargetedChain really is a special type of Chain with separately", 
   "identifiable requst, pivot, and response handlers. Similarly,", 
   "SimpleTargetedChain is really a special type of SimpleChain as its name", 
   "implies and the patch enshrines this in the code by making the former", 
   "extend the latter.", 
   "2. SimpleTargetedChain is initialised in stages which allows it to appear", 
   "in partially initialised states, e.g. with the request handler set but", 
   "without the response handler. This is changed to provide explicit", 
   "constructors which take the appropriate number of parameters and produce", 
   "valid SimpleTargetedChain instances. The error checking code in SOAPService", 
   "to cope with partially initialised states is then unnecessary.", 
   "3. There is quite a bit of duplicated logic between SimpleTargetedChain and", 
   "SimpleChain which can be deleted once the former is changed to extend the", 
   "latter. The result is easier to maintain. For example, if we rename undo or", 
   "modify its behaviour, we will not have to touch SimpleTargetedChain as it", 
   "will inherit its undo behaviour from SimpleChain.", 
   "4. There is also duplicated logic between SimpleTargetedChain and", 
   "SOAPService. In the patch, the additional logic has been separated out into", 
   "a Handler inside SOAPService which then allows the standard behaviour of", 
   "SimpleChain invoke (and undo) to be inherited.",
