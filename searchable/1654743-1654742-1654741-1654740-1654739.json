   "SLING-4139 : fixing regression introduced with SLING-3389 : topology announcements that are no longer active (thus no longer in the AnnouncementRegistryImpl's cache) will be cleaned up from the repository. They used carry a heartbeat which made them invalid automatically, but SLING-3389 removed writing that heartbeat. Added a number of tests to reproduce what has been reported in both SLING-4139 and SLING-3726."
