   "Fixed performance of Wipe effect. It turns out that micro-tuning the shader code is very important, since that same inner loop runs on every pixel of the bitmap being affected. This change splits the single Wipe shader (with a direction parameter) into four separate Wipe shaders (WipeLeft, etc.), to avoid a switch on the direction parameter. Also, it avoids some setup of pixel values, only bothering to sample the pixel values after it determines which image to sample from. Little stuff, but gained about 20-25% performance on some sample wipe effects.",
