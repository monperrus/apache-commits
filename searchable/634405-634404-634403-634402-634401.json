   "[MNG-3394] Reenabling the project.injectPluginManagementInfo(..) call in DefaultLifecycleExecutor.getMojoDescriptor(..), but also moving the project-plugin search out of the 2-token condition where the prefix is resolved, to below all of the token-parsing but just above the injectPluginManagementInfo call, to allow the project-plugin's version to override if it exists. This fixes the case where the lifecycle specifies a plugin but the project's build/plugins doesn't have the version in it...but the project's build/pluginManagement does."
