   "Added a new Appender from the Log4j contrib code base as QpidCompositeRollingAppender. This will allow us to roll the broker log files on a set time frame AND to a maximum file size. The CompositeRollingAppender was contributed by Kevin Steppe to the log4j project but as it is not part of the log4j.jar we must include it in our own code base until log4j provide a core implementation.",
