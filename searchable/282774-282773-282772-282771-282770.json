   "Another step in Handler/ServletWrapper refactoring - moved init, destroy", 
   "and all related code to ServletHandler.", 
   "The big advantage is that now Handler is very simple, it deals only with", 
   "service() ( and we go back to the Apache/IIS/NES model where the handler", 
   "is a simple object ). All lifecycle ( init, etc) is present in the interceptor,", 
   "and duplicating it in Handler was confusing and resulted in many errors.", 
   "The Handler is a part of the extension mechanism of tomcat - a module", 
   "( Interceptor ) can define a number of handlers ( like StaticHandler,", 
   "ServletHandler) to generate the output ( either directly or via another", 
   "mechanism - like servlets, jsps )", 
   "I think this is the right direction, please review it and send any comments.", 
   "( there are few more simplifications, but this commit has only the code", 
   "move and associated fixes )"
