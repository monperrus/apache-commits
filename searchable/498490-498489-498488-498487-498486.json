   "Not sure what the ideal solution is but if you leave the same checkout directory a release will not work because different levels in the repository are checked out in order to add new artifacts and you get errors because the url at that level is not the same. So for each new checkout create a clean directory structure. Ideally for repository deployments we just need to point it at the fixed location of the repository which is the checkout. Only tested this with SVNKit."
