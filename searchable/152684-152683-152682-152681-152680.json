This adds javadocs to all public methods, fixes some resource leaks (Findbugs term: OS), replaces string concatenation with StringBuffer (SBSC), avoids catch (Exception e) (REC), avoids hiding of internal variables by parameter names, makes variable access explicit, and uses entrySet instead of keySet (WMI)."
