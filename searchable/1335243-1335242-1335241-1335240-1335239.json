   "ARIES-825: Refactored manifest computation code. It is now broken up into three distinct phases that will (hopefully) be easier to follow and maintain. (1) The raw data stage (RawSubsystemResource) where the data is read and any necessary subsystem manifest headers are computed; (2) the mature resource stage (SubsystemResource) where the deployment manifest is computed, if necessary; and (3) the runtime resource stage (AriesSubsystem) where the actual installation occurs."
