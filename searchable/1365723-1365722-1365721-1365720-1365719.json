   "[master] [89-fb] Fix TestMasterTransitions and make mini-cluster test debugging easier", 
   "Author: mbautin", 
   "Summary:", 
   "TestMasterTransitions started failing when we moved RPC server initialization from the constructor to the run method. The test keeps trying to start a regionserver on the same port in a loop, and the old way of handling the bind exception stopped working.", 
   "Also changing regionserver thread names to include the server host, port, and generation stamp and doing some other minor code cleanup.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "Run TestMasterTransitions 100 times", 
   "Run all unit tests",
