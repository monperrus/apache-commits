   "In RichEditableText I moved the static var that controls background-drawing from the subclass of TextContainerManager that actually does the drawing to the RichEditableText class itself, to be consistent with how you set it on SimpleText and RichText.",

   "Integrated a private build of TLF from Rich.", 
   "This build has an additional tabbing-related fix on top of TLF Build 424. We decided to take 424 because it allows all event handling in TextContainerManager to be overridden, which may be important for fixing beta bugs. But Rich also fixed a new bug that I found today: if you had moused over a TextInput or TextArea, then when you tabbed to it you couldn't enter text. This build passed the TextInput and TextArea Mustella tests. We'll take the official 425 tomorrow which will be 424 plus this new fix.",
