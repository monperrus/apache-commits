   "Some JellySwing changes.", 
   "Firstly added support for <borderLayout> and <borderAlign align=\"center\"> style of tags to use the Swing BorderLayout.", 
   "Added support for <vbox> and <hbox> to create Swing Box panels (which have their own inbuilt BoxLayout)", 
   "Also added colfill=\"true\" and rowfill=\"true\" options on <td> so that columns can stretch", 
   "Finally I've improved the JellyRunner so that its a little dialog, with a history field and a button so that reevaluating the same script can be much easier. Just hit save in your editor and hit the button and the Jelly script executes immediately - no more waiting for a JVM to start."

   "So if users don't want to parse the output of the XSLT, they can just pipe it out as SAX events.", 
   "Also added a test case of this."
