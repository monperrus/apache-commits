   "Moved configuration-related code to a new module.  This decouples configuration issues from Shiro's core API since config is largely environment specific (Ini, Tapestry, Spring, Guice, etc).  This also (finally) removes shiro-core's dependency on Apache Commons BeanUtils.", 
   "BeanUtils is now only a dependency if you're using Shiro's OGDL (Object Graph Definition Language-style configuration, like ini config.", 
   "Finally, some shared/common utility code was moved to shiro-lang."
