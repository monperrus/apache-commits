   "changed doAction and doRender signatures to match this core.js change: jetspeed.url.retrieveContent (which wraps dojo.io.bind) now takes bindArgs object as first argument (encompassing formObject, mimeType and requestUrl) to enable the use of additional dojo.io.bind arguments (eg. formFilter); most retrieveContent callers have signature changes to match the signature change to retrieveContent or at least have adjustments to the args used to call retrieveContent"
