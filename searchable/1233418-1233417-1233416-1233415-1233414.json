   "jnlp files for featured demos, but hidden at the moment, to be able to try them online.",

   "If/when all is good, regenerate the deploy and commit the deploy/demos/index.html with Web Start links.", 
   "Note that to simplify things, jnlp files here have been taken from pivot-demos, then fixed by hand, and copied directly under deploy/demos by hand. Maybe later implement a better flow, via the Site ant build (if possible)."
