   "Added new class (VelocityAptLogSystem) that implements the org.apache.velocity.runtime.log.LogSystem interface.  This class acts as a bridge between Velocity and APT logging systems, forwarding any error or warning messages generated by Velocity on the APT messager.  This means a) error/warning streams are unified for Velocity-driven codegen initiated by an annotatin processor, b) Velocity errors will result in compile failures as they should, and c) velocity.log files will no longer be dropped in the current directory."
