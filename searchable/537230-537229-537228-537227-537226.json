   "Changed a bit the way the compiler generates the cbp file. Used to have some issues with several processes having the same name (but different namespaces) in the same bundle. So now:", 
   "1. The cbp file has the same name as the original bpel file.", 
   "2. It's generated in the same directory.", 
   "Also added a dry run mode so people can run the compiler to check their process without having any cbp file generated."
