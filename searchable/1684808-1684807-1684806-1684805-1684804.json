   "DERBY-6810: Add regression tests for XXE vulnerability.", 
   "This patch was contributed by Abhinav Gupta (abhinavgupta2004 at gmail dot com)", 
   "This change adds a new regression test suite to hold tests for XXE", 
   "vulnerabilities in XML data type processing.", 
   "The new test case is in a suite by its own because we want to control the", 
   "overall security configuration (e.g., we want to ensure that no security", 
   "manager is installed).", 
   "Over time, as other types of XXE vulnerabilities are studied, we can add", 
   "additional test cases to this test suite.", 
   "Note that this test case demonstrates incorrect behavior, we believe. When", 
   "DERBY-6807 is fixed, this test case will need to be changed accordingly."
