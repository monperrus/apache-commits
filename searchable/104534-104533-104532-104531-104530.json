   "Move context-stealing code from apreq_filter into apreq_filter_make_context.  For it to work optimally on subrequests, we need to go back to setting req->parser as late as possible.  More debugging logs added to ensure the tests exercise the context stealing code, and two new tests added to env/t/request.t (which may have line-ending problems on win32?) to fully exercise the context-stealing code.  Unrelated to any of the above, this patch also drops USE_ITHREADS conditional from apreq_xs_tables.h, since", 
   "that logic is already in ppport.h."
