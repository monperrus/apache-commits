   "Refactoring of AbstractTextSerializer to make the extending serializers HTMLSerializer, TextSerializer and XMLSerializer POJOs. The Avalon functionality is kept for backward compatibility. There is also a (deactivated) Spring configuration file that not is complete yet as we still have to find a way for handling the mime settings for sitemap components.", 
   "I have only been able to do limited testing of the new functionality as the mime type handling not work yet while configuring the serializers as Spring beans. But they at least seem to be set up correctly."
