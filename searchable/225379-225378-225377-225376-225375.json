   "Working on: MNG-521", 
   "o Cleaned up output from discovery of MavenProjectBuilder instance in MavenProjectTestCase.", 
   "o Added <relativePath/> to parent in maven.mdo (default value is '../pom.xml')", 
   "o Added filesystem parent-POM search using <relativePath/>...if discovered pom doesn't match the parent specification (g:a:v), then it's not used - the parent is resolved - and search for ancestor POMs on disk goes no further.", 
   "NOTE: Next thing is to reactor-ize the release plugin, then MNG-521 should be implemented."
