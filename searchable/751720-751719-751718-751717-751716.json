   "Removed false positive return from FU.delete(). Delete mirrors functionality provided by java.io. Attempting to delete an non-existent file returns false. The caller must handle this correctly. If client provides a null value then the call will throw a NPE which is a valid java response."

   "QPID-949 : Removed all getMessage() calls as this will cause a flowed message to be read in to memory from disk. In all instances the reason was to perform methods that exist on the the QueueEntry. Added accessor to MessageID on QueueEntry. Outstanding getMessage() calls have been left in to perform NO_LOCAL work. Moving Publisher and PublisherClient identifer to the QEI would remove this need."
