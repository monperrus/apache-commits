   "Added support for sanitized content rendering.",

   "1. Bind NekoHtmlParser instead of NekoSimplifiedHtmlParser. The code will work without this, but it is not guaranteed to be safe.", 
   "2. Pass the 'sanitize' argument with a value of 1 in a gadget context. This can be done in an iframe by passing &sanitize=1 in the query string.", 
   "This does not currently sanitize CSS correctly, and it is not really any safer than 'standard' gadget rendering until that is done. Louis is working on making this work as noted in his recent parser commit messages."
