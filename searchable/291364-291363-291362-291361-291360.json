   "Finshed to resolve the dependency on skinconf and the whole default forrest presentation model. All contract expect now properties from the view and not the skinconf.xml and if they before took the pm as default they are now have to request them by the view. Removed the hr contract and added a generic markup contract. That means that you can now use any markup in a view. Removed the *.page as generator. Extracted pipelines that produces the dataModel to a specific sitemap. Update default and pelt theme to use the new contracts."
