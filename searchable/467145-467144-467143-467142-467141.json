   "MNG-2628 Whenever you run the integration tests, they currently extract resources into $TEMP, even if the resources are already just lying around as files on the file system. Under this patch, tests can use \"simpleExtractResources\" to force the ResourceExtractor to guess the proper location where the tests should be run, and hand back a File pointing to the resources to use.",
