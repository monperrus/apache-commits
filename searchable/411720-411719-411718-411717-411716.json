   "1. Modified the code generator to have post extensions that can do tasks such as formatting", 
   "2. Added an XML pretty printer that works on JTidy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy). It is done just like the java pretty printer where the classes are loaded by reflection. However the JTidy jar needs to be in classpath for this to work.", 
   "3. Added three new extensions", 
   "I. JavaPrettyPrinterExtension which calls the Jalopy pretty printer internally and prettifies java source files.", 
   "II XMLPrettyPrinterExtension which prettifies XMLs", 
   "II WSDLPrettyPrinterExtension which prettifies WSDL files", 
   "4. removed the call to PrettyPrinter from the ClassWriter"
