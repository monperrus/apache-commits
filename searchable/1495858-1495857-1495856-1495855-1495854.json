   "No JIRA: Refactored QMF GUI qmf-ui.js to remove a lot of copy and paste reuse when rendering QMF objects in various pages. I've added a qmfui.renderObject and qmfui.renderArray method to handle these general patterns and hopefully improve maintainability. There's no new features in this update, just some slightly more readable code"
