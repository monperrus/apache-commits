   "DataGrid.as - Added style metadata for borderAlpha, borderColor, borderVisible, contentBackgroundAlpha, and contentBackgroundColor.", 
   "Grid.as - Add backing variable for variableRowHeight so it doesn't depend on gridDimensions.fixedRowHeight anymore.",

   "GridColumn.as - Invalidate the grid when dataField and labelFunction are set.",
