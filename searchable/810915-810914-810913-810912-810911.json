   "UIMA-1547: fix test cases.  Add workaround for various sun jvms ignoring instructions not to create standalone=\"no\" declarations in xml files.  Still doesn't work with sun java 1.5 because it ignores instruction to add pretty printing indentation to files.  Have not found a workaround.  Since this makes no functional difference, one could also argue that the test cases are not set up properly.",
