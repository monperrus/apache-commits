   "\"* The Test Recorder (TR) had a bug where, in some cases, during record and/or playback the html captured by the TR did not match the html returned to the browser by the container.  The bug was encountered in some usages of the jsp:forward tag in a jsp page, where the container desired to reset the jsp writer buffer.  The fix consists of implementing the reset() and resetBuffer() methods in the ResponseWrapper to reset the TR output buffer when requested.", 
   "* Fixed a bug where in some cases the test recorder test links were not properly produced.", 
   "* Modified the string representation of exceptions during logging:", 
   "included exception messages and stack traces of nested exceptions.", 
   "* Added some debugging around request data - request params, headers, post params, etc.\""
