   "1.) Moved the Renderer creation further down from AreaTree to RenderPagesModel (subclass of AreaTreeModel).  Still have the issue of the four-param constructor a bit messy, also some of the exceptions I have to declare to be thrown may not be necessary.", 
   "2.) Removed encapsulation-breaking methods from AreaTree; dropped the AreaTreeBuilder class as it wasn't conformant with our API and required too many objects to expose internal functionality.", 
   "3.) Validity checking added for fo:title, however still won't work as #PCDATA needs <fo:blocks> around it within FOP, but the Recommendation bans those for fo:title.", 
   "4.) isInlineItem() added to FObj, as a quick check for the %inline; parameter entity as defined in spec."
