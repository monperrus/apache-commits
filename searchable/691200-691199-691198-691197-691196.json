   "COCOON-2241 - The commandline is not working since cocoon-1985. In COCOON-1985 it was introduced a lock to prevent problems in concurrent situations. This code change was not tested with the CLI mode of cocoon since the cli environment does not store the http-requested object. The introduced solution looks wheter the http-request object is null if so we will test whether we are in cli mode and lock this object instead."
