   "o Removed the size which was stored before the serialized entry", 
   "o Totally refactored the MavibotParentIdAndRdnSerializer class to use the new RDN/AVA/StringValue serializer (major speedup)", 
   "o Don't decrement the counter on MavibotTable when we remove a value, do it only when we remove a key", 
   "o Many fixes in tests"
