   "* Fix synapse.xml so the demo works (correct regexp)", 
   "* Check log.isDebugEnabled() before logging each result of RegexMediator (saves a little time)", 
   "* Add ability to specify <faultCode> and <reason> in the FaultMediator configuration.  Will improve this (and connect it up to the actual fault generation) as soon as I figure out how to easily configure AXIOM SOAP faults."
