  "msg": [
   "(1) Refactored various exception-throwing code bits to use the extended constructors for WikiException/WikiSecurityException/ProviderException to provide for better logging and debugging. (2) Added support in WikiCallbackHandler for HttpRequestCallback and WikiEngineCallback. This means LoginModules used for JSPWiki integrated (custom) authentication can now access the WikiEngine and the HTTP request. Thanks to Lou Peters and many, many others for bringing this issue to my attention. Please test this function! This change has been forward-ported from 2.8.3. (3)  As a result of the additional callback support for LoginModules used with integrated authentication, AuthenticationManager gains a new method, login(WikiSession,HttpServletRequest,String,String). Please use this instead of login(WikiSession,String,String), which is now deprecated. This change has been forward-ported from 2.8.3."
