   "Flex now requires CSS Style declarations to declare @namespace rules and disambiguate between halo and spark components using CSS 3 namespace prefixes on type selectors. At compile time, this namespace information will be used to map type names to qualified ActionScript class names. At runtime, type selectors are matched on qualified ActionScript class name (for example mx.controls.Button rather than just Button). Flex 3 applications must be compiled with -compatibility-version=3.0.0 to get unqualified CSS type selector behavior.", 
   "QE: Yes, this build may help in updating test cases to use the new namespaces and class names.",

   "- DataGroup bug around a visualelement being moved to another datagroup (SDK-19680)", 
   "- Added removeAllElements method to IVisualElementContainer (SDK-19424)", 
   "- Fix up ASDoc/RTE messages for Group/DataGroup/FxContainer when calling addChild(), removeChild(), etc... (SDK-19582)", 
   "- Added an mx_internal method, specifically for automation, so mouse event listeners can get added to a Container without adding a mouseshield and changing the behavior of the component (SDK-18864)", 
   "- When both skinClass and skinFactory are set, the skin doesn't get reloaded properly when skinFactory changes when it's a non-ClassFactory (SDK-19450)", 
   "- autoLayout and typicalItem properties weren't getting proxied properly on FxDataContainer (SDK-19799)", 
   "- Tabbing through two focusable items, when one of those items is partially \"offscreen\", starts the tab loop with the second item instead of the first (SDK-17283)", 
   "- Add Icon file for FxVideoDisplay and VideoElement.", 
   "- Also fixed up some ASDoc versioning info for stuff that was added in the Flex 4 timeframe but was actually added to the framework project and not the flex4 project.", 
   "- Also renaming Group.setMxmlContent -> Group.setMXMLContent to follow proper naming conventions.",

   "Last PARB changes for FxContainer/FxDataContainer.  We're now exposing more properties on the FxContainer from the underlying Group (same for FxDataContainer and DataGroup).  The only new property being exposed on FxContainer is autoLayout.  For FxDataContainer we're now exposing autoLayout, typicalItem, and the renderer_add and renderer_remove events.  We're also being smarter about when to add events on the underlying contentGroup/dataGroup--however, we're ignoring some of the parameters in addEventListener and these aren't getting proxied down on to the listeners we add to the contentGroup/dataGroup.",
