   "When a UIMovieClip resizes, it does so through scaling. Before UIMC was keeping track of this on it's own.  Now that AdvancedLayoutFeatures support this through scaleX/scaleY, UIMC can now rely on this behavior.  This also helps fix some Effects bugs which rely on this to figure out the difference in transformations that get applied and contribute to the \"width\" and \"height\" properties and ones that don't.",
