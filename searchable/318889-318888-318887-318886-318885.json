   "Adding new property http://apache.org/xml/properties/entity-expansion-limit. It takes java.lang.Integer object as its value. When this property is set by the application, before opening any new entity parser checks for the entity expansion limit set by the application, if number of entities expanded exceeds the entity expansion limit, parser will throw fatal error. Default value for this property would be 'null' It means there would not be any limit for number of entities that can be expanded by the parser."
