   "No longer set the AudioSession to recording type until press the record button.  That mode was preventing VoiceOver from speaking when view first loaded.  Additional accessibility cleanup:  When the audio view loads was posting an UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification.  It really should be a UIAccessibilityScreenChangedNotification since we are loading a new view.  No need to call setIsAccessibilityElement:YES on standard UI controls."
