   "Finished working on invalid input problems and model problems in choices.  The result is a reworked choice model in a new model sub-package of form (which makes it a lot easier to read the form components in the form package).  In addition, this checkin includes significant fixes to the wicket.model package, the most important of which is the elimination of DetachableModel, in favor of typesafe and simple usage patterns in AbstractDetachableModel."
