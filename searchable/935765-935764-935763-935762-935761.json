   "Tidied up the Parser API and fixed some small niggles:", 
   "1. removed getXMLTagName() method as this is never used, even internally", 
   "2. added more javadoc in lots of places", 
   "3. removed unused ILocalizedEntity.setLang (it is only referenced directly from AbstractLocalizedEntity)", 
   "4. renamed \"IManifestModelBase\" to \"IElement\" as I think it fits the overall naming scheme better", 
   "5. added missing ASF license header to IStartPageProcessor", 
   "6. used a StringBuffer instead of inefficient looping over and concatenating strings in AbstractLocalizedEntity", 
   "7. fixed a potential gotcha with a missing return value assignment in WidgetPackageUtils.convertIdToFolderName", 
   "(NB 6&7 were spotted by the FindBugs Eclipse plugin; 1&3 showed up when running the EclEmma code coverage Eclipse plugin)"
