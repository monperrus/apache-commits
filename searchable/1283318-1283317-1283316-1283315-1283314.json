   "Fixed bug with transform effects acting on optimized FXG objects. We did not have some of the required functionality on SpriteVisualElement that would allow objects of that type (optimized FXG objects) to be animated by the flex 4 transform effects. We have added that functionality and pushed that common property (postLayoutTransformOffsets) and function (transformAround()) into interfaces implemented by  the objects that can be so transformed.",
