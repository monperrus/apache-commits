   "[UIMA-4024] repackage json support for uimaj sdk with that project, but keep it separated from uimaj-core (so uimaj-core has no dependencies on it).  Add build profile that can be specified from the commandline -P!json-support  to exclude this support from the binary build - have alternate NOTICE file for that too.  Update Javadocs, and uimaj javadoc collection (to include json).  Split the json support into two packages - one with an \".impl\" suffix (which doesn't have public facing APIs)."
