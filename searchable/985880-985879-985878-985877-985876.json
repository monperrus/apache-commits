   "SLING-1656 Unconditionally send back a 401/UNAUTHORIZED response from the requestCredentials method if no other authentication handler was willing to request credentials. Same for the extractCredentials method: The built-in HTTP Basic handler is only called if no other credentials handler was willing to handle the request. So the handler will first try to extract the authentication header and if missing request credentials if the sling:authRequestLogin parameter is set to any value."
