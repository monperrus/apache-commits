   "1) Durability for federation links (broker-to-broker connections)",

   "a) Links can be created even if the remote broker is not reachable", 
   "b) If links are lost, re-establishment will occur using an exponential back-off algorithm", 
   "3) Durability of exchanges is now viewable through management", 
   "4) ManagementAgent API has been moved to an interface class to reduce coupling between the broker and manageable plug-ins.", 
   "5) General configuration storage capability has been added to the store/recover interface. This is used for federation links.", 
   "6) Management object-ids for durable objects are now themselves durable.", 
   "(Note: some refactoring needed around ProtocolAccess needed to try and reduce dependencies)"
