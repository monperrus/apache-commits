   "Added a background thread to flush the txns from the unflushed part of the txn log to the partitions. For now the thread just wakes up with a predetermined interval and flushes the txns. Could be improved to be woken up only when enough data in logs accumulate.", 
   "Added JdbmStoreTxnTest and AvlPartitionTxnTest. Easier to test txns at this level. Added txn demarcation to groups of ldap operations and tests concurrent searches to see they see consistent data and code can handle multiple thread. More tests like these should be added."
