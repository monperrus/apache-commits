   "Author: aaiyer", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Currently, we add a transient assignment, but do not remove it in the favoured", 
   "assignment path. So, if a region gets assigned to a server, which is not the", 
   "primary, then", 
   "until the transient assignment times out in 1 minute:", 
   "- load balancer tries to close the region and assign it to Primary.", 
   "- The transient assignment plan is rejected because of the preexisting", 
   "assignment (which was not cleaned up).", 
   "- the region may get reassigned to the non-primary server again.", 
   "We should clean up regionsWithTransientAssignment as soon as we have", 
   "asked the server to open the region.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "run MR tests. do a cluster start/stop and make sure that", 
   "we do not run into the same condition",
