   "* Hunting to a new channel within a channelset never triggered a disconnect from the previous channel(s). This isn't a problem in general, but does becomes a problem when an app defines two distinct channelsets containing at least one shared channel at the head of the list. In this case, the first channelset hunts past it and connects on a later channel. But when the second channelset hunts through (triggering a connect fault when it hits that initial shared channel that can't connect), the fault is processed by the first channelset as well (incorrectly).",

This fixes the scenario of starting off on streaming or RTMP, loosing connectivity temporarily and then getting stuck on a fallback polling channel.
