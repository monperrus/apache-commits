   "added the NIO SSL transport listener, and a sample jks keystore to startup the listener", 
   "updated the axis2.xml we ship to include the SSL listener", 
   "updated the synapse.sh script to support the renaming of the SynapseHTTPServer as SynapseServer", 
   "updated pom.xml to include dependency for niossl - but the code should now be compiled under JDK 1.5, and the target code would be 1.4 compatible. Hence it is still possible to run Synapse on JDK 1.4 if the NIO SSL transport is not used"
