   "Even though Apache is documented as only calling the module initializer function (jk_init) once, it actually calls it multiple times, at least on Windows.  A couple of times it is called on the same process which causes open_jvm to fail on the second pass because the jvm was alread instantiated on the first pass.  In open_jvm2, we can catch this and try to get the instatiated jvm and attach to it, preventing a hard failure (a call to jk_error_exit()) which also shuts down the webserver."
