   "version of todays driver (9/03).",

   "addition of a client/server side handler, along w/ client-config and", 
   "programatic API access changes.  It deploys/undeploys the service", 
   "appropriately.  The handler adds a header element at each of the hook", 
   "points, incrementing a counter in the header.  Lastly, on the client", 
   "response, it checks to ensure the counter has been updated appropriate and", 
   "calls a static method to the testcase (it's out-of-band) to confirm that", 
   "the handlers executed appropriately.", 
   "The code changes take into account the role/header/parameter options (which", 
   "were wrong/missing in the code orginally checked in)."
