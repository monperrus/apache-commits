   "TUSCANY-3653 - Read JAXWS annotations in Java interfaces (JAXWSJavaIntefaceProcessor) and, in the JavaIntefaceProcessor, post process these to reconfigure the Java interface based on what is found. The case where WSDL is referenced is tricky and still has holes. The WSDL is read and is attached to the Java interface as a normalized interface and is used during interface matching. Binding implementations that care about WSDL should really check the normalized interface rather than the service interface itself. This is still a TODO."
