   "When the shale-tiger Property annotation is evaluated, a nifty type converter is used to coerce the source data type to the target data type.  This utility reuses existing JSF converters outside the context of rendering.  It assumes a FacesContext and UIViewRoot.  I removed the requirement that a UIViewRoot is needed.  Since we are using converters for outside of the component tree, we just need a object that extends UIComponent (SHALE-406)."
