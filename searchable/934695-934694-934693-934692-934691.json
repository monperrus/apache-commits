   "Chainsaw UI updates (feedback appreciated)", 
   "- instead of the default row selection rendering of changing the row's background color, the selected row color is preserved but a border around the selected row is displayed", 
   "- removed table row and column margin (border around cells in the selected row had gaps without making this change)", 
   "- updated widths of fields in status bar", 
   "- performance tweak: tree node selection no longer triggers unnecessary calculations (only currently displayed rows are recalculated for highlighting)", 
   "- removed bevel border around ID field", 
   "Fixed xml decoders - an empty throwable node was resulting in a loggingEvent with a non-null (but blank) throwableInformation ('exception exists' expression in Chainsaw would match all events)"
