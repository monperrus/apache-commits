   "Updates to get the JMS binding requestConnection and responseConnection attributes working using bindings defined in the definitions.xml file. This is not the final code for this as the definitions.xml processing is being refactored (by Simon Laws?) as part of TUSCANY-2499, this shows the type of function that the JMS binding will need as part of that work. Two parts that need work are that SCADefinitions.getBindings  currently returns a list of Objects not Bindings as otherwise theres a cyclic dependency in the maven modules, and there needs to be a way for bindings to get at the SCADefinitions which is currently being done by getting at the contribution processing internals with ExtensibleModelResolver.getDefaultModelResolver and DefaultModelResolver.getModels."
