   "found spam trying to use blank mime boundaries, in violation of the rfc.  it's not clear if we should accept or ignore the blank boundary (muas are all over the board wrt how they handle it), so this commit will have us accept the blank boundary.  we can easily change it to ignore the blank boundary with a 2-line comment change if we later decide to do things differently."
