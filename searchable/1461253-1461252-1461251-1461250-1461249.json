   "Summary:", 
   "The test creates regions in the meta region and waits for the master to allot them to regionservers. When the favored nodes were set, the timout was not completely reliable to say that they will be set.", 
   "Instead setting the favored nodes while creating the regions directly in the starting would ensure that the master creates the regions assigning selected favored nodes.",
