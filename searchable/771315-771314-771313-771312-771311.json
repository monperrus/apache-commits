   "JS2-946: Removing unmodifiable wrapper for language list from portlet definition.", 
   "SVN history shows that this kind wrapping was done by r705396 when pluto-2 was initially integrated. However, I think it was accidental because there was no special reason to wrap it at that time and there's still a client code (PAM) in j2-admin depending on mutable list. (This broke PAM portlet, which needed a mutable language list to remove an item.)"
