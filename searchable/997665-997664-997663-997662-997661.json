   "Put back the base jar pom.xml to include explicit dependencies instead of using the features/base as the shade plugin doesn't seem to work quite right with pom type dependencies. It ends up with the feature/base and its transitive dependencies still being included in the dependency reduced pom.xml which means all the individual modules still come in as transitive dependencies. There may be some way to fix this with shade plugin excludes but while i work that out put this back to the old way"
