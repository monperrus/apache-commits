If focused, and text is set, set content with the text instead, since this will create a TextFlow and the underlying interaction manager which is needed to type without a mouse click or a mouse hover over the field first. Also if the text or content is changed while it has focus, set a selection, since the previous selection was wiped out.  (lines 1395 and 1567)",
