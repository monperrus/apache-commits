   "finally fixed the beginning/ending callbacks of pages. This was not done properly for listener interface calls: internalBeginRequest was called to late, or in case the listener set another page to render, not at all. The same problem applied to internalEndRequest. As this method is where the component models must be detached (see earlier fix), this had the effect that models were often not detached. Which in turn gave problems - besides a temporary memory leak - with lazy Hibernate initialization etc."
