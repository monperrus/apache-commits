   "Fixing the issue AXIS2-1755, added a remove service link to remove the serivce from the admin page of services. Though this has been done in the same manner the rest of the admin console stuff were. I think there need to be a whole re-write of the admin console of axis2, including the style of writing the webapp as well as the UI, but that is out of the scope of the 1.6 release."
