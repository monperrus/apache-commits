   "submission, HBASE-3976 is pending further testing and clarification of whether", 
   "we cache non-data block types (i.e. blooms, indexes, etc.) on compaction. The", 
   "data block case was taken care of by HBASE-5263.", 
   "Coming back to HBASE-4422: here is Jonathan's original description of", 
   "CacheConfig. From StoreFile down to HFile, we previously used a boolean", 
   "argument for each of the various block cache configuration parameters. The", 
   "number of parameters is going to continue to increase as we look at compressed", 
   "cache, etc.  Every new config currently requires changing many constructors", 
   "because it introduces a new boolean. In this patch we move everything into a", 
   "single class so that modifications are much less disruptive.",
