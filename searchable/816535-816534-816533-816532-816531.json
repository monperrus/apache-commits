   "DERBY-4372: Wrong result for simple join when index is created", 
   "If the inner table in the join is restricted by an explicit or", 
   "implicit IN list on an indexed column, an index range scan is", 
   "performed between the smallest value and the greatest value in the IN", 
   "list.",

   "return the NULL values anyway, it is safe to ignore them. The edge",
