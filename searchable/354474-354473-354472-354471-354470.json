   "Applied patch, with small logical fix (used getArtifactId() where getGroupId() was the intention).", 
   "This patch will guard against overwriting cached models in the project builder (check for pre-existing model in cache before adding), and will validate that a POM's parent has a different groupId:artifactId than the current POM."
