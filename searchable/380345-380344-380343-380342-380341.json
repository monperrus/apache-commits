   "* Complete redesign of server startup code.", 
   "* Normal server startup is handled by the KernelMain object.  This object is not a java main class, but should be created, initialized and started from a java main class.", 
   "* Added SpringBootstrap java main class, which uses a Spring configuration file to create a GBean Main, which kernel main implements.  The default spring configuration is contained in the jar at META-INF/gbean-bootstrap.xml", 
   "* Added JarFileClassLoader which is a new implementation of a local file only URL class loader.  This class loader has a destroy method which closes all file handles, so the files can be deleted on windows."
