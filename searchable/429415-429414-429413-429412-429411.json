   "If you don\u2019t explicitly define a serialVersionUID, the language requires that the VM generate one, using some function of all field and method names in the class. The problem is, the compiler generates some synthetic methods that you never see in your source file, and there is no clear specification for how these synthetic method names are generated. Any two compilers are likely to generate different method names, and so the serialVersionUID will be different. Bottom line: Always define the serialVersionUID explicitly in your source files."
