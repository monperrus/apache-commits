   "There isn't much we can do for #1, classes still need to be registered with Flash player so strong types are used instead of generic Objects on the client/server. For #2, I added a URLUtil.hasTokens(url:String) method that takes in a url and returns true if the url contains server.name/server.port tokens. Then, I changed Channel url token replacement code to use this new method. This resolves the \"url is null\" error.",
