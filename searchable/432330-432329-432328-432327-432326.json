   "for category permalinks we need to url encode the category twice to ensure that it works properly.  this is because the url path is automatically url decoded before it can be accessed by the request object, and thus if a decoded category url has a character like a \"?\" then it will break.  double encoding fixes this problem and works fine because the url is first decoded by the container, then we decode it once more ourselves."
