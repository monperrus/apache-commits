   "Support old way of adding service in PhoneGap 0.9.5", 
   "PhoneGap 0.9.4 replaced PluginManager.addService() with navigator.app.addService().  This is problematic with the older plugin as they are not being maintained.  I'm adding in a PluginManger JavaScript class which will implement the addService method and call navigator.app.addService() method under the hood.  This way we won't break old code."
