   "o Fixing resolution of LATEST in plugin-versions, when <useLatest/> is enabled in plugin-registry.xml, or when --check-plugin-latest is specified on the command line.", 
   "o Fixing core-library resolution for expression: ${plugin.artifacts} and ${plugin.artifactMap} (latter is keyed by g:a)", 
   "o Modified maven-core-it-plugin to accept something like \"-DartifactToFile=org.apache.maven:maven-artifact\"...it'll lookup that artifact in ${plugin.artifactMap}, and touch a file that's a mutation of the abs. path for that artifact.", 
   "o Added pomArtifact to ResolutionGroup, since the MavenMetadataSource ALWAYS creates a new Artifact for a pom...this allows us to retrieve the resolved Artifact for that pom."
