   "* The ReasoningService interface have been changed to include reasoning service tasks. Tasks were managed by the rest endpoint previously, but this had the problem that it needed to be aware of the specific method to call in the SCR service. We want to make tasks to be extendable, allowing the implementation of custom reasoning services. It includes, by the way, two default tasks, that MUST be implemented by any service (CLASSIFY and ENRICH). The Consistency check have been left as a specific method call (it has a different return type). We removed also the specific methods from the interface (classify() etc...)", 
   "* Abstract implementations have been changed according to the point above. Default task implementation methods are now protected. We left the run(...) methods as utility, to run directly the reasoner without specifying the task.", 
   "* Added the UnsupportedTaskException to the API", 
   "* Changed tests accordingly.", 
   "* Changed the web resources accordingly."
