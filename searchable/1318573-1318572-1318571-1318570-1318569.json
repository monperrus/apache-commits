   "Preserving whitespace for Spark text components and text-related child tags. Whitespace that appears inside a text component but outside of text-related children should be ignored. The presence of any non-text related child tag removes whitespace at that level to avoid multiple-initializer errors for values.", 
   "Note: This change is a work around for now as the MXML compiler wasn't setup to customize whitespace handling on a per-component basis. Longer term we need a way for components to opt in, perhaps via a manifest entry.",
