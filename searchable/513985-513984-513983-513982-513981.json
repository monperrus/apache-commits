   "Big content rendering refactor; condensed methods used for rendering content into one, flagged to cache or not. This will make maintaining this much easier. Implemented new streaming event which will send all type of files not just images (deprecating the img event); added mime-type templates to remove the hard coded templates in DataResourceWorker; now supports additional types besides image/*; updated all code using the old methods; however left them in place (deprecated) until we are sure no BSH files use these old methods"
