   "Fixing JIRA Issue #1421: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1421. We were calling previousSibling() when the node was in an inconsistent state, which would return the last child instead of null when the first child is being removed. We were just lucky to get the correct result from checkNormalizationAfterRemove(). Now it works by design and should be slightly faster when we're removing the first child. Patch thanks to Ludger B\u00fcnger. Also thanks to Thiwanka Somasiri for helping to investigate this issue and evaluating Ludger's patch."
