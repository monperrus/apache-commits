   "HBASE-3065: make the ZooKeeper recoverable from ConnectionLoss Exception", 
   "Summary:", 
   "All the zookeeper client call can be failed by ConnectionLoss Exception and we", 
   "need a neat way to retry and recovery from the connection loss.", 
   "There are 2 tricky operations, setData and create.", 
   "These 2 operations are not idempotent.", 
   "We cannot simply  retry them and but need to verify whether the previous",

   "the previous operation works.",
