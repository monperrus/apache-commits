   "Move the invocation of actually object to a separate method, this makes it easier to override the invocation while still be able to reuse other functionalities in AbstractInvoker and JAXWSMethodInvoker. Below is the comment from Bharath: \"In a J2EE container model, when the Endpoint has no SEI(no interface), the container would like to give some crude object, which might be like an InvocationHandler, this crude object's invoke method would have the logic to the actual invocation on the POJO. So this Object would not contain the actual which CXF is supposed to invoke, instead it would act like a dispatcher, which would have an invoke() method, which internally takes care of maintaining the POJO Instance and performing the invocation\""
