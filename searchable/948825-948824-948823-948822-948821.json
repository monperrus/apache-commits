   "Added set_vmhost_os and vmhost_os subroutines to Provisioning.pm.  These allow a provisioning module to set and access an OS object for the VM host OS if one was created.  As a result, the provisioning module can call $self->vmhost_os->... to access the VM host computer's OS the same way it would call $self->os->... to access the guest's OS."
