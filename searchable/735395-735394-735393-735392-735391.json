   "Workaround for a TCK test that needs to be challenged.", 
   "According to EJB 3.0 \"4.4.4 Restrictions for Transactions\" any remove methods from home or component interfaces must not be allowed if the bean instance is in a transaction.  Unfortunately, the Java EE 5 TCK expects has tests that ignore the restrictions in 4.4.4 and expect beans in transactions can be removed via their home or component interface.   The test to see if the bean instance implements javax.ejb.SessionBean is a workaround for passing the TCK while the tests in question can be challenged or the spec can be changed/updated."
