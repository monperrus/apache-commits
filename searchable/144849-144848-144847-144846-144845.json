   "Added support for BeanShell expressions in the core tags along with some unit tests. Unfortunately things are a bit of a kludge to support BeanShell - some changes are required to make it more optimal like (i) supporting a compile() of beanshell expressions and (ii) having to explicitly push in all variables in the context via Interpreter.set() rather than it being able to pull them from somewhere. Hopefully a neater EL could be Velocity."

   "Added more examples and things to do. Also added parent relationship to Tag interface and make the body script a property of Tags so that they can modify and change their body at will (e.g. be a pre-processor or macro). Also added early version of core tags with a stub implementation of ExpressionFactory which I'll try get working with beanshell. A velocity & rhino implementation would be nice too..."

   "First alpha-cut of a little research project called Jelly. Its a simple XML tag based scripting language. It borrows ideas from JSP taglibs, Velocity and XDoclet. For those that like Velocity-style syntax we should be able to layer a non-XML parser on top of the standard XML representation. Its still work in progress but any comments would be welcome"
