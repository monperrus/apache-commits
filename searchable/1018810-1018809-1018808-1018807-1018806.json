   "initial work on providing a pluggable ObjectFactory (the intent being to use Cglib to enhance pojos); ObjectFactory and ClassStrategy are now propogated down into JavaReflector/JavaSpecification/JavaIntrospector, and #loadSpecification() semantics changed to potentially return a null for a class (eg CGLib-specific) that should be skipped.  Not yet fully working, but the default impl (JavaObjectFactory) does still work and all tests are passing."
