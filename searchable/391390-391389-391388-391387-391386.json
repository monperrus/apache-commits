   "DERBY-1152: Failures in sysinfo tests with different classpath settings", 
   "Depending on the way the classpath was set, the sysinfo_withproperties and", 
   "sysinfo tests were unreliable. The problem is that the underlying sysinfo", 
   "classes are present in your classpath in several possible ways: you might", 
   "be pointing directly at the classes directory, or you might be pointing to", 
   "one of: derby.jar, derbytools.jar, or derbynet.jar, all three of which have", 
   "the sysinfo classes in them. This means that there are four possible", 
   "sections of the derby_tests.policy file that might be in effect for the", 
   "sysinfo classes during a test run, and those four sections were inconsistent.", 
   "This change modifies the derby_tests.policy file so that, at least for the", 
   "classpath and locale file permissions that are used by sysinfo, the policy", 
   "file expresses a consistent set of permissions for each of the four code", 
   "sources. The change also updates the master files to reflect the chosen", 
   "permissions, which are to allow access to the classpath and the locale files."
