   "Updated svn:ignore to add in a bunch of the Eclipse specific files. When running \"mvn install eclipse:eclipse\" at the OODT trunk these files are generated. There is actually a bug in version 2.7+ of the mvn eclipse plugin that doesn't seem to create the appropriate Eclipse files; the problem seems to stem from dealing with resource files. To work around this when using the mvn eclipse plugin simply use version 2.6. This can be accomplished by issuing the following in the trunk \"mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-eclipse-plugin:2.6:clean org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-eclipse-plugin:2.6:eclipse\" and will setup the OODT project with the Eclipse files."
