   "- Added new 'Display timestamp delta between displayed events as space between rows' preference to log panel preferences screen - feature adds a gap between rows proportionate to the time delta between displayed events (off by default)", 
   "- Added 'millisdelta' dynamic property to events, which is always updated to represent the number of millis between this event and the displayed event in (thisrow-1) - this property can be used in color and find rules (but using it in a filtering rule will change the delta since the displayed rows are changing)", 
   "- Renamed 'log4j.marker' property to 'marker' (prop.marker can now be used in expression)"
