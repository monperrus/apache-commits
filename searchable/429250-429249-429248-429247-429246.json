   "Addressed some issues with i18n stuff and comparisons, type conversions; for numbers spaces are removed before parsing; for comparing with constants the en locale is assumed, ie the right value or value2 is mean to be a constant (we might have to do something with expanded strings here, but there string expansion should also generally expand numbers in the system or en locale; may still be an issue there, but the FlexibleStringExpander does a toString to this should be fine); this should fix Apahce Jira OFBIZ-133 and OFBIZ-136"
