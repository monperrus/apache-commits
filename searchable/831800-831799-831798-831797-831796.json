   "Fixed bug in ContentManager.pageExists() that caused tests for version 1 of pages to fail if there had been no other versions saved yet. Shockingly, we had never tested for this condition before. As a result, webapp page-viewing actions now work again. Related: added versioning to ViewActionBean, which hadn't been added previously because the versioning code hadn't stabilized until recently."
