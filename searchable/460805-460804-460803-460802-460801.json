   "Added more type safety like getParentFolder() and convenience methods such as getNestedFiles() which does recursion to match all the files in a folder hierarchy.  This is remarkably powerful in the code I'm writing and reveals how badly damaged the existing Java File object is.  For example, if you're trying to write a file to a folder that might not exist, you can now say file.getParentFolder().ensureExists()."
