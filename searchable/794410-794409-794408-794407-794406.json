   "Created a MemoryBlob class based on the code of BAAOutputStream/BAAInputStream. This class implements the same interface as OverflowBlob (Synapse's TemporaryData). This will make it easy to switch between in-memory storage and file based storage of binary data. It also provides a nicer API than BAA(Input|Output)Stream."
