   "[master] Fix a small problem of not closing the scanner", 
   "Author: daviddeng", 
   "Summary:", 
   "If the user stops the scanning by calling `HTableClientScanner.close()` during scanning, it is possible the `Fetcher.callable` is not closed. A checking is added at the end of scanning to close the scanner if `callable` is not null.",
