   "HADOOP-5285. Fixes the issues - (1) obtainTaskCleanupTask checks whether job is inited before trying to lock the JobInProgress (2) Moves the CleanupQueue class outside the TaskTracker and makes it a generic class that is used by the JobTracker also for deleting the paths on the job's output fs. (3) Moves the references to completedJobStore outside the block where the JobTracker is locked. Contributed by Devaraj Das."
