   "SOAPPart.writeTo(array) was not working because MessageElement.output() simply replays the recorder and misses the latest changes.", 
   "The other way to fix this is to call setDirty(true) on all message elements recursively, while inside SOAPPart.saveChanges(). But i dont think it is optimal either."
