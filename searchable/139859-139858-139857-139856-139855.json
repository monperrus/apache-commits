   "Changed ValidatorResources to store FormSets as a vector attached to the Locale key rather than as a single element.  The way it was, it was causing only the formset of the last XML file for a given Locale to have it's FormSets saved.", 
   "Potentially very destabilizing change, but it passes the unit tests afterward, so I think it's OK, since the changes are all internal to ValidatorResources (i.e., it's all private access stuff, and the API is still the same.)", 
   "Only screw case I can think of is that if resource initialization is called multiple times on the same Resource (and I couldn't think of a plausible case of this happening), the FormSets are going to pile up on the Vector used to store it.",
