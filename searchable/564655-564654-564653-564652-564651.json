   "Fixes \"Drafts erroneously published if user hits enter while in title or tags field\"", 
   "http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/roller/browse/ROL-1525", 
   "There may be a more sophisticated fix that allows us to maintain the old button order, but the easiest fix here is to put the draft button first in the line-up.", 
   "I tried to disable the \"enter\" button entirely via onsubmit=\"return false\" and postToWeblog() saveAsDraft() and submitForReview() methods, but the Struts2 <s:form> element changes that to \"return false; return true\", so I backed off to this more simple approach."
