   "Changes in Crawler", 
   "- initial directory change was fixed", 
   "- documentation was added", 
   "- JUnit test was started", 
   "- session tracker was checking array values for smaller when should have been for bigger (fixed)", 
   "- added ability to turn tracking off and just use a set number of sessions", 
   "- added listener which checks database connection periodically and will reconnect if it finds the connection has been lost", 
   "- allowed for database connection to be lost, yet download will continue (even if database reconnection failed -- all files will be tested for existence in database on ingest when database is again up and running).  However if database comes back up, during the Crawler's periodic check it will find no connection and will reconnect and the Crawler will again begin using the database checks on files to be downloaded after the database came back up."
