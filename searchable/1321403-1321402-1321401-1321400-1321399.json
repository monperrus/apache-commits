   "Adding dpi field to AIRLaunchInfo and modifying PlayerSessionManager to correctly pass this value to ADL with -XscreenDPI, when the value is > 0. This is used by Flash Builder to tell ADL what it should report for the Capabilities. This should not affect any client that does not directly set the dpi field on AIRLaunchInfo.", 
   "QE notes: When launching a mobile application in ADL from Flash Builder, the framework will query the AIR runtime for the dpi and use it to scale appropriately. Flash Builder will always pass the device configuration's DPI to ADL.",
