   "Update the Tomcat distribution so that SCA contributions can be deployed to exsiting Hosts instead of running in the Tuscany webapp. This means they run just like a regular web application and can be managed with the usual Tomcat admin and use all the usual Tomcat Host and Context features. Also update to configure the domain from the context so the domain nad be customized fro the Tomcat instance and each contribution via a context parameter. That removes the need for the singleton install option so that is removed. Also update the install page to have a bit of text about whats going on in the intsall"
