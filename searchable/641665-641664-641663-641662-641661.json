Moving the mergeManagedDependencies(..) call INSIDE of processProjectLogic(..), to just AFTER interpolation but BEFORE injection of managed-dependency information into the main dependencies information, and also ahead of model validation. This allows expressions in imported-POM specifications to be interpolated before these are merged to the current project.",
