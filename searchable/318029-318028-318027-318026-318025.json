   "add support for EBCDIC and make support for UTF-16 more robust.  Did this by adding an inner class to XMLEntityManager to wrap InputStreams, in place of the OneCharReader inner class that attempted to rwrap readers.  Because of the way Java-supplied readers work, the former method would not work in general.  While this method does, its downside is that it is not possible to get the wrapping object out of the way as it was in the OneCharReader case, so it is likely to be somewhat less efficient."
