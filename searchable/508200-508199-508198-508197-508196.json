   "fix up some crud regarding the use of the s:url includeParams attribute.", 
   "Struts2's default behavior is for includeParams=\"get\", but it turns out that is bad default if you are using s:url to link to static resources and various other things where attributes from the action have no relevance.  So to fix this we are setting the new default to includeParams=\"none\" and simply letting any s:url calls which want the params to explicitly say includeParams=\"get\""
