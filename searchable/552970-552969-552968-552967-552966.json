   "2. Weblogger planet UI no longer handles editing of subscriptions, it only accepts feed urls and all the processing of subscription details are handled by the planet code.  This simplifies the UI quite a bit.", 
   "3. Weblogger planet integration has been updated so that weblogger can more easily customize the way the Planet backend is bootstrapped for use with integration.", 
   "4. Weblogger planet integration has been updated so that local weblogger feeds added to the planet aggregator are now marked with a custom feed url identified as \"weblogger:<blog handle>\" which makes it easier to identify local weblogger blogs."
