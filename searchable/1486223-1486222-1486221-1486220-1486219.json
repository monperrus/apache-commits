   "PIVOT-864: Adding a \"pluggable\" file system browser to Pivot based on", 
   "Apache Commons VFS (Virtual File System).", 
   "Basically this is a clone of the existing FileBrowser and FileBrowserSheet", 
   "components with the names changed and using the VFS2 FileObject instead", 
   "of File everywhere.  The skins are cloned and changed also.", 
   "Currently it has only been tested with local file system browsing and", 
   "it doesn't yet browse into local .zip archives (for instance).  There", 
   "are some other features I may add such as found in the Swing-based", 
   "VFSJFileChooser.", 
   "The Commons-VFS and supporting .jar files are only necessary to be", 
   "available on the classpath if the VFSBrowser or VFSBrowserSheet", 
   "classes are instantiated.", 
   "I have added the basic .jars (current as of 24-May-2013) to the", 
   "wtk/lib directory and added additional classpath references to this", 
   "directory to several of the Ant tasks so the compile and test tasks", 
   "will work out of the box.", 
   "Tested the \"clean\", \"package\", \"doc\" and \"test\" tasks to make sure", 
   "they are all clean.", 
   "There are a number of remaining basic tasks:", 
   "- Need to figure out \"getFileRoots\" replacement (doesn't exist", 
   "right now in VFS API).", 
   "- Need a way to specify a different URI scheme to browse to remote", 
   "systems (such as http:// or ftp://) (such as an input text field", 
   "or an ancillary dialog)", 
   "- Similary we need to deal with authentication, when required, for", 
   "remote systems.", 
   "- Enhance the browsing to be able to browse into archive files in", 
   "addition to just directories.", 
   "- Address the TODO: items in the code."
