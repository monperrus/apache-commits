   "Eliminate any chance that we will end up with JCL 1.1 transitive dependencies in WEB-INF/lib for these sample/test applications. This is an effect of a broken JCL 1.1 POM, MNG-1577 (dependencyManagement does not work for transitive dependencies), and that fact that we added a Digester <dependency> to these POMs when we upgraded to 1.8 (r482455). A better solution may indeed involve fixes elsewhere, Shale or otherwise, but this seems necessary for producing a good set of v1.0.4 artifacts for these sample and test applications.",
