   "Changed the canonicalization and encoding to not use the CSS and JavaScript codecs, especially for canonicalization they cause problems with backslashes in strings which we generally want to allow and which generally isn't used in webapp input strings and I don't think we interpret such encodings anywhere so there is no danger nor utility for it; this better resolves the filename/etc problem reported by Jacques, so his temporary fix is now gone"
