   "JIRA NMAVEN-5: This fix allows the adding of a GAC dependency within a build file. The only tricky part is that artifact resolution comes prior to NMaven becoming platform-aware. For GAC dependencies, NMaven waits until the construction of the CompilerContext to add the GAC file location to GAC artifacts. This fix only supports MS framework. For Mono/Linux may need to mandate use of nmaven-settings.xml file so we know the location of the GAC."
