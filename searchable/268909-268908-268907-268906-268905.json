   "- Removed javadoc explaining attributes of task. This info is already in the", 
   "vsshistory.html file. I didn't want to duplicate the work.", 
   "- Renamed task attribute \"outputfilename\" to \"output\" to unify the task", 
   "attribute namespace (i.e., other tasks use \"output\", why not this one?).", 
   "Also made sure that the output filename is relative to the project's", 
   "basedir.", 
   "- Added task attribute \"dateFormat\" to allow the format of dates in \"toDate\"", 
   "and \"fromDate\" to be specified. This was necessary for the \"numDays\"", 
   "functionality to work properly with my date format.", 
   "- Added \"default\" choice to \"style\" attribute. If an unknown style attribute", 
   "is provided, a BuildException is thrown.", 
   "- Fixed examples in the documentation which not included vsspath", 
   "- Only pass -R once to ss.exe and only if recursive is really specified", 
   "Submitted by: Twiggs, Glenn <Glenn_Twiggs@bmc.com>", 
   "Minor changes by me."
