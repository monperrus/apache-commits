   "Excellent bit of code which we were using for some time. See we call the get method, check for null then again call the get method inside the if.", 
   "Improved this a bit not to use the getter method and directly access the variable itself as the call is within the class. I know this is not correct as far as encapsulation is concerned, but this improves the performance."
