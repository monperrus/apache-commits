   "With the upgrade of the main site being now based on maven-2, site inheritance \"kicks in\" for sub projects having the portals-site pom as parent.", 
   "This results in (at least) breadcrumb links being inherited and I see no way to turn this off!", 
   "To fix this, I've introduces a new portals-site-parent pom and moving all the primary meta-data like developers info into it.", 
   "All \"site\" poms now inherit from this new portals-site-parent pom instead, so the site inheritance doesn't interfer anymore."
