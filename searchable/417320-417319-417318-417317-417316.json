   "Adding a test and a fix for LANG-100. This is a bug in which the randomly created String can sometimes be illegal unicode; because the code does not consider when relationships exist between characters. High and low surrogates are now dealt with, but I'm skipping private high surrogates because I can't find out what to do. Need to go plod very slowly through the spec. This site was very useful: http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/private_use_high_surrogates.html"
