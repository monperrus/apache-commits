   "A fix suggested by Michael Reichenbach at \"Multiple responses send by SOAPEventHandler when ServiceValidationException occurs\"   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4207",

   "When calling a service that was defined as \"export=true\" and a non-optional parameter is missing, then the SOAP-Response is not a valid XML.", 
   "Cause", 
   "=====", 
   "The cause is, that in SOAPEventHandler.invoke() the dispatcher.runSync() throws a ServiceValidationException (\"The following required parameter is missing...\"). This will be catched by the GenericServiceException-block, a error response will be written to the output stream (via sendError()) and an EventHandlerException will be thrown. This exception will again be catched (this time by the Exception-block and another error response will be written to the output stream.",
