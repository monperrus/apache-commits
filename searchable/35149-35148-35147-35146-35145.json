   "(  2004-05-03 05:41:25 - Project CVS Service )   As of 2004-04-28 the CVS services will no longer function with the hostname of cvs.PROJECTNAME.sourceforge.net. You should change your CVS commands to use the host cvs.sourceforge.net (the fix for this under all platforms is to perform a checkout into a new directory using the new hostname) and that should resolve any outstanding issues that you may have (this includes issues relating to the SSH host key change warning, among others). This issue came about as a result of upgrading from BIND 8 to BIND 9 which doesn't allow for a wildcard in the middle of a hostname.",
