   "Looking at answering Ant's question about serializing WSDL for enpoints as part of making cross domain interface matching work. Turns out to be more difficult that I would have thought. Mainly to do with how you re-build the Tuscany WSDL/XSD model from a string rather than from a set of files (which is where I think Ant got to). Any how I extended the WSDL test to experiment and have some code that works but isn't yet in the runtime (see WSDLSerializationTestCase). Don't want to loose it though."
