   "First cut at a Clover plugin. It adds one delegator named \"maven:clover-report\". ATM to make it work you need to have the clover jar in your project POM as a dependency and to also to copy it to your ANT_HOME/lib directory (I'm looking to simplify this). Then simply type \"ant maven:clover-report\" and then \"ant maven:site\" and you should see a new \"Clover Test Coverage\" menu item under \"Project reports\".", 
   "Note: For the moment only unit tests are used to generate the report. Integration unit tests are not included yet in the report (but will be in the next version of the plugin)."
