   "Added wait_for_child_reservations_to_exit subroutine to State.pm. This is called by cluster parent reservations when they exit the inuse processing.", 
   "Added State.pm::state_exit. This is currently called from inuse.pm whenever it exits. It makes sure an 'exited' computerloadlog entry is added when reservation processes exit. It also calls wait_for_child_reservations_to_exit if the parent of a cluster request.", 
   "Updated inuse.pm to call state_exit instead of exit.", 
   "VCL-699", 
   "Moved creation of mn_os object from State.pm::initialize to Module.pm::new. This allows non-state objects access to the MN OS functions.  Changed mn_os from being stored in $self for each object to $ENV{mn_os}.", 
   "VCL-682", 
   "Reordered xCAT.pm::node_status to immediately check currentimage.txt for 'new' reservations instead of first checking if the computer is powered on, etc. The xCAT steps were overloading the management node for large cluster reservations.", 
   "Other", 
   "Fixed typo in utils.pm - sleep_uninterrupted subroutine name was misspelled.", 
   "Removed chunk of code from image.pm which was supposed to change the request state to 'completed'. This is not a valid state name and was not doing anything. The state is properly changed later on."
