   "[UIMA-1756] merge mavenAlign branch into trunk for uimaj.  Ran mvn clean install OK on aggregate-uimaj, uimaj-distr, and uimaj-eclipse-update-site - got all to work.  (Needed a renaming of artifact for eclipse-update-site to go from maven coordinates to the eclipse conventions).  Also remove META-INF/Lic,Not,Discl  inserted by previous build process - should not be in source tree, and is now automatically inserted into Jars.  This merge includes all the fixes done in the mavenAlign branch, including a bunch of fixups to eliminate javadoc generation errors (usually caused by bad javadoc comments), and getting rid of DISCLAIMER files."
