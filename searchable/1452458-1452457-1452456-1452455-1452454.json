   "The get_firewall_configuration sub was generating a ton of vcld.log output by displaying both the netsh.exe output as well as the hash that is generated from this command's output. Changed call to execute() so that it doesn't display the output. Added code to construct a string representing the hash that is returned with 1 rule per line. It had been calling format_data which was displaying several lines per rule. Also added code to ignore IPv6 rules for now since the rest of the code can't support them yet."
