   "It's no longer mandatory to specify java.endorsed.dirs on the command line while starting org/apache/geronimo/Tomcat configuration or its webapps.", 
   "The variable is set to point to 'lib' directory of Geronimo build. However, the lib contains Xerces 2.6.0 jars (xercesImpl-2.6.0.jar and xmlParserAPIs-2.2.1.jar), which doesn't seem to work well. Either the libs will be removed or Xerces will be upgraded to 2.6.2 (these jars work fine). Currently, the only way to run the tomcat configuration is to remove Xerces jars from lib directory - it seems Geronimo doesn't need them.",
