   "QPID-3892 C++ broker add routing key wildcard support to Acl 'publish exchange' lookups. Although this patch does not address the original issue's regex request it provides the desired functionality in a more comprehensive manner.", 
   "* Acl publish exchange rules may specify routing keys using the topic exchange syntax with '*' and '#' wildcard match tokens.", 
   "* Acl lookups hook in to the broker's topic exchange key match code to perform the wildcard match.", 
   "* Acl rules written using the old Acl wildcard syntax (with a single trailing '*') will continue to work the same as before."
