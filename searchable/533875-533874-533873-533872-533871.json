   "Moved init-db plugin configuration for test and production to profiles, test-setup and setup respectively.", 
   "Now anywhere in the project (in context of a pom.xml), you can initialize the database using:",

   "or (for production):", 
   "mvn -P setup org.apache.portals.jetspeed-2:jetspeed-maven-plugins:init-db", 
   "Note: I'm working on fixing the tests again (got it working partly already). I noticed that running init-db in process before testing causes tests to fail.", 
   "This would most likely require forking the init-db execution, but I'm not so sure that'll be a good idea, nor that it is needed.", 
   "The way the tests are going to be setup (clearing the database before/after the tests), you only would need to init-db once, or after the schema is changed.", 
   "Thus I see (right now) not much use for in-process execution of init-db before running tests"
