   "QPID-1119 QPID-1262 : The issue with the SWTDTest was down to QPID-1103 and the fact that the configuration is not propogated to the Java profile. The test runs fine InVM but cannot be run externally until QPID-1103 has been completed. QPID-1262 is still an issue but it is not a blocker for this test."
