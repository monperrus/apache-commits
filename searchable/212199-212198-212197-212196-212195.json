   "the vector of change of altrmi is bigger than that of the excalibur projects. To be able to fix gump errors further down the dependency tree (ie cocoon deps on avalon and stuff like that), I am temporarily breaking the \"continuous integration\" cycle by having excalibur depend on a specific version of altrmi. It is not possible to depend on a specific branch or tag for altrmi as none exist."
