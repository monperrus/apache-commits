   "Got rid of a bunch of warnings with suppression.  Added initial support for starting/stopping zk on the fly.  Added new CentralizedServiceMaster interface that the master will use (safer then using BspService directly).   Added new TestVertexInputFormat and TestVertexReader implementations as example.   BspInputSplit knows its inputsplit id and total count."

   "Initial Partition support is added (everyone computes their maximum index and saves it to ZK).  Parameterized CentralizedService to allow any index type.  Added missing sendMsg() interface.  Fixed VertexReader to take in a set of edges, rather than a single edge."
