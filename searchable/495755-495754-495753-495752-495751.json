   "Created common AMQMethodListener class, allowing the Request and Response managers to use a common interface to dispatch events to both the client and servers. Refactoring of bothe the client and broker AMQStateManagers and AMQProtocolSession classes was performed. The refactoring has run aground in the clustering, however, and this still needs to be resolved. As the cluster tests are currently disabled (by whom, I'm not sure), this does not disrupt the overall test result. JIRAs will be opened for this issue."
