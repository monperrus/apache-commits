   "DERBY-2775 (partial) Remove one use of DataTypeDescriptor.setNullability() that was not required. Nullabilty was being set for system columns that needed to be upgraded in old databases from an incorrect value. Using the nullability of the original definition is already correct and avoids redundant setting. Changed the name of the method as it is now a generic fix a system column rather than being specific to nullability."
