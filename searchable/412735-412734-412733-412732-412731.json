   "Added region-body_display-align to demonstrate the default behaviour for adjustable spaces when display-align is set to \"auto\".", 
   "Reactivated proprietary display-align=\"distribute\" so a block-container can cause its content to be \"justified\" in the reference area if it's large enough and the adjustable elements (min/opt/max) allow for it. I may be misusing the original intended behaviour of \"distribute\" but for block-container this seemed suitable since it's destined to produce only one viewport/reference pair if possible. Test added that demonstrates the proprietary value on block-container. Note: on normal region-body elements, display-align=\"distribute\" has currently no effect since the code did not evolve with the changes in the layout engine."
