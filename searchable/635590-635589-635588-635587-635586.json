   "QIPD-841 : Problem with SimpleACLTest was that the ConfigurationFilePrincipalDatabaseManager was looking up the ApplicationRegistry for the configuration. Most of the time this is ok but during test tearDown/startUp sometimes the config is null on lookup. This method is just wrong anyway. the ConfigurationFilePrincipalDatabaseManager setup is the only setup that looksup the configuration from the AppRegistry. So adjusted so that it takes it as a parameter as other classes do."
