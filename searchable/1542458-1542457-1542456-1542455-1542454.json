   "Update all instances of ReadersWriter to use ReadersPriorityWriter.", 
   "ReadersPriorityWriter implementation is very similar to it's parent class ReadersWriter, however it utilizes Java 5 explicit locking and conditions to avoid waking all reader and writer threads, when only a writer can obtain the lock.  This avoids warm reader threads from repeatedly synchronizing on the object lock, causing contention delays for the writer trying to obtain a write lock."
