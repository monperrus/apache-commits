   "no Jira - improve a test case which gets a resource from a pool, tries to get it again (and gets null), starts a thread which releases it in .2 seconds, then has the other thread try to get it, waiting up to 1 second.  Unfortunately, this test took 3 seconds - and it failed, so I'm guessing the machine got pre-empted for 2-3 seconds, and the .2 second delay to release the resource didn't actually get that thread started... Change the time the main thread waits for the release from 1 sec to 5 secs to reduce spurious failures."
