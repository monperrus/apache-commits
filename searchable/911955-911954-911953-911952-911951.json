   "DERBY-3729: Improve client-side messages when file or disk fills up.", 
   "This change is intended to improve the error messages which are returned", 
   "by the Derby client JDBC calls when error message XSDG1 occurs. This", 
   "particular error message may arise when the disk fills up, or it may", 
   "arise due to a quote or filesystem limit. For example, on FAT32 file", 
   "systems, an individual file is limited to 4GB and when that limit is", 
   "reached, error XSDG1 occurs.", 
   "Delivering error information back to the client in this case is tricky,", 
   "because the XSDG1 error is a database-severity message, meaning that the", 
   "database is closed, the connection is closed, and the session is ended,", 
   "so the information must be send to the client as part of the Command", 
   "Check Response Message itself.", 
   "This change: adds additional text to the XSDG1 and J123 messages, and", 
   "enhances the client's handling of the CMDCHKRM to look for possible", 
   "error information in the SQLCARD."
