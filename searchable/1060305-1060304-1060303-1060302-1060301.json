   "page interception is mostly used in the cases when the user tries to reach a page which is secured somehow. In this case the request is intercepted and the user is lead to a login page which in most cases is stateless. We need to redirect in this case because stateless pages by default are rendered directly (without redirect) and all links in the rendered page are calculated against the url of the interception page but browser still thinks this is the secured page with its url."
