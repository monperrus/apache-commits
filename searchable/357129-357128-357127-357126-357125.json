   "Fixes for getting UTF-16/MTOM working:", 
   "- Added a getReader() in that can check/consume the BOM to find the encoding as well as to create a InputStreamReader based on encoding.", 
   "- Get/Set CHARACTER_SET_ENCODING in OperationContext (See AbstractHTTPSender.java and TransportUtils.java) otherwise it is getting lost.", 
   "- Switch on UTF-16 in EchoRawMTOMTest.java", 
   "- Switch ByteArrayOutputStream in OMOutputImpl to a StringWriter. Since we need a string in MIMEOutputUtils anyway. no point converting back and forth.", 
   "(also writing to OutputStream twice in UTF-16 was adding 2 BOM's)", 
   "- Roll back previous change to CRLF in writeBodyPart method in MIMEOutputUtils. It was an untested change during hackathon.", 
   "- set the character encoding in StAXSOAPModelBuilder.java. Since we later check the character encoding and throw an exception."
