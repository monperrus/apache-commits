   "A patch from Paul Foxworthy \"Tax not added for order shipping or promotion\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4160) - OFBIZ-4160", 
   "When shipping is calculated for the entire order or a promotion adjustment is made, the relevant tax rows from the TaxAuthorityRateProduct table are not being found.", 
   "This bug was discovered independently by Sergei Biletnikov, see http://ofbiz.135035.n4.nabble.com/VAT-is-not-applied-for-the-shipping-td3234699.html.", 
   "I committed Paul's (slightly modified: formatting) patch with an explanation on screen. I will later add an enforcing js script", 
   "This is not a definitive answer but a workaround, see http://markmail.org/message/ewvaljuqg3voiy2s for more"
