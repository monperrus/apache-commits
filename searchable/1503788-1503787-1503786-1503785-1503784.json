   "JS2-1283: Applying Ate's initial patch to avoid the problem with some additions:", 
   "(1) Moved the code retrieving AccessControlContext/Subject from Worker impl class to RenderingJob impl class because a worker thread implementation can be provided by the container (e.g, commonj worker monitor)", 
   "By the way, JSSubject.doAsPrivileged() may involve JSSubject.setSubject() which also needs ServletRequestCleanupService. Therefore, the code calling JSSubject.doAsPrivileged() must be moved to the job implementation class as well.", 
   "(2) ServletRequestCleanupService now has #executeNestedRenderJob() method to provide proper thread context initialization/clean up like its #doFilter() method. (Thanks to Ate!)", 
   "(3) Contract extraction to be shared with worker monitor implementations (RenderingJob.ACCESS_CONTROL_CONTEXT_WORKER_ATTR)"
