   "VCL-279", 
   "Added code to reserve.pm which checks if the OS module has implemented a post_reserve() sub and calls it. Added post_reserve() sub to Linux.pm which attempts to call /etc/init.d/vcl_post_reserve on the node if it exists. This allows the image creator to create a vcl_post_reserve script which is automatically called after all of the reservation tasks are complete. The script has access to the cluster_info file if it's a cluster reservation. Changed Linux.pm's post_load to attempt to call /etc/init.d/vcl_post_load on the node for consistency."
