   "Added Version_6.pm::ignore_private_default_routes() subroutine and added call to this subroutine from post_load(). The new sub configures default routes configured for the private interface to be ignored. Default routes configured for the private interface cause problems communicating from the computer to the public network if the metric of the private default route is less than the metric of the public default route. When this occurs, traffic is always routed on the private interface."
