   "o changed the inheritanceApplied flag to be set by default, and unset if the plugin is merged to the child without <inherit/> being specified...this makes it work with isolated POMs.", 
   "o changed the semantics of when the unsetInheritanceApplied() method is called...it's now only when <inherit/> is NOT set.", 
   "o changed the default inheritByDefault attribute on MojoDescriptor to be true", 
   "o added inheritByDefault to PluginDescriptor (even though we don't have tools supporting it yet), with semantics identical to MojoDescriptor", 
   "o added generator/builder support for the inheritByDefault attribute of PluginDescriptor", 
   "o added calculation of inheritanceApplied || inheritByDefault to lifecycle executor before allowing plugins/mojos to bind.", 
   "o Everything builds, but we need some sort of IT to test the finer points."
