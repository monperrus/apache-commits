   "[HBASE-9972] Make HBase export metrics to JMX by default, instead of to NullContext", 
   "Author: gauravm", 
   "Summary:", 
   "I was debugging the metrics issue in the swift branch, and found that HBase doesn't export to JMX by default. The JMX server is being spun-up anyways in single node setup, we might as well export the metrics to it.", 
   "Copied the hadoop-metrics.properties file from titan shadow 25.", 
   "Test Plan: Tested it by spinning up the cluster, and verifying that the metrics show up on JConsole",
