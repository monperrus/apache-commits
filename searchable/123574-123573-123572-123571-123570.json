   "This fixes the NetUI server DRT problem where the tests wait for 5 minutes without deploying the webapp.  The URL which is used to ensure that the server is started is set (by default) to http://localhost:8080/ and expects some webapp to be available there.  Then, the DRTs deploy the coreWeb/ webapp and run the tests.",
