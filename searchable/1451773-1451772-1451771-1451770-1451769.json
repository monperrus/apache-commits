   "ACCUMULO-1123 - Had compensation for propogation times for uncached permissions. Authorizations and passwords didn't have the luxury. Added in transient state for authorizations and a pause for ChangePass to help compensate. Ideally, there would be compensation throughout the code for the password, but the code has already become a bit of a rats nest. WalkingSecurity helped clean it up tremendously, I should rewrite a lot of the states now that that exists to make it simpler."
