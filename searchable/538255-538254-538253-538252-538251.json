   "Cleaned up debugging, slightly altered onResized() to accurately reflect scrollDiv (was using its clientWidth when I wanted its offsetWidth).",

   "clipping only in one direction---for example, if you create a table that's shorter", 
   "than the sums of the specified widths of its columns, you will get both the requisite",

   "2.) Under Firefox, dynamically shortening a table below its natural width (after load),",

   "suggests that in this case the scroll div is being clipped by the dom node---it's too", 
   "wide, and so the bar is outside the region displayed."
