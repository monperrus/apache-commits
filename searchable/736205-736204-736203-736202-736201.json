   "Modified destroy() method chaining - previously used destroy and chain of before*Destroyed() method calls, which was confusing and hard to trace across the class hierarchy.  Now using simple super.* overriding calls for easy traceability.  The previous before*Destroyed() methods existed for simple subclassing overrides, but are no longer relevant since the next release will favor a composition over inheritance model (subclasses should be very rare).  Also modified some JavaDoc to reflect this."
