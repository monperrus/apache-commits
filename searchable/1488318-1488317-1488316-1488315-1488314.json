   "Fixed some bugs in the form widget column sorting code:", 
   "1. URL parameters were being mangled by clunky string manipulation code.", 
   "2. The sort column logic was piggy-backed on the pagination event. I created a new choice for the form widget <on-event-update-area> element - \"sort-column\" - so column sort events can update their own areas.", 
   "3. The parameter name for the sort column was hard-coded, so column sorting in multiple lists on the same screen would not work. I added a new <form> attribute - \"sort-field-parameter-name\" - so each list can be sorted separately."
