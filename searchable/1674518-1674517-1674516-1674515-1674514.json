   "[JDO-709] Initial merge of Matthew's proposal for attribute converters. Note that this concentrates solely on class and field/property specification (and ignores package, and its optional subpackages/subtypes attributes), with the idea that we get something to cater for the 95% use-case initially and think about adding those others in a later issue. Added copyright header to the patch"
