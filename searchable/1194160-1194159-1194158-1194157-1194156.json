   "fixes #6 - allow scaling in Camera.getPicture", 
   "integrated pull request from Charles Chan to include additional targetWidth and targetHeight options and implement scaling the returned image to specified size.  Documented the getPicture() options in camera.js.  Did not implement support for selecting image type as it is not available on other platforms."

Return empty array (rather than error) when no contacts found in find. Added support for fields = [\"*\"] to return all field information. Modified code to return some value if displayName requested and there is no other name information."
