   "[SUREFIRE-459] Very basic Jetty test fails.  By default forkmode=once and useSystemclassloader=true, which causes us to launch the tests using a a manifest-only jar; this confuses Jetty when it passes java.class.path to javac to compile JSPs.  Fixed by deliberately \"faking out\" the java.class.path, setting it to what the classpath would have been if we'd launched the app in a conventional way.  This also has the benefit of more generally insulating our users from the manifest-only jar; java.class.path will look \"normal\" now."
