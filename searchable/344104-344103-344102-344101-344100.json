   "On the SvnChangeLogCommand command, I changed the date format specified in the command line.", 
   "The original format looked like: svn log -v -r \"{2003/09/10 GMT}:{2003/10/10 GMT}\"", 
   "But this format was not legal in svn version 1.2.3 on cygwin, linux, or windows. I am not sure if a previous version supported this date format, but the current does not.", 
   "The new date format looks like: svn log -v -r \"{2003-09-10 00:00:00 +0000}:{2003-10-10 00:00:00 +0000}\"", 
   "It is now specifying the time along with the date. The api allows a user to pass a date, so we should probably use the time in the date as well.", 
   "I also changed ScmTestCase.getDate() to support passing time values so I could test the changelog command creation."
