   "Updated Range, TrackBase, Slider, Spinner to use valueInterval to constrain values. In Slider, snapInterval was removed in favor of just using stepSize (for simplicity). TrackBase also is able to handle a resizable thumb.", 
   "Refactored ScrollBar to subclass TrackBase instead of Range in order to share thumb dragging code. pageSize was also moved from Range into ScrollBar.", 
   "Added a basic version of NumericStepper that can handle simple operations like committing the value when the enter key is pressed.", 
   "Skins for each of the components were also updated/added as needed. I also updated flex4test/CircularScrollBar.", 
   "QE: Yes!",
