   "Started to refactor the domain manager UI into smaller independently reusable widgets. Tested OK with Firefox 2 and 3 and Safari 3, still debugging a javascript error with IE 7. Changed the HTTP binding to implement OptimizableBinding as was done for the Atom Binding, to allow Widgets to get the correct reference binding URIs from the target services. This is temporary until the domain manager app is migrated from SCADomain to NodeFactory."
