   "Sample module showing how to use the Scribe logging API to connect to a Scribe server and log a string under a given log category. The sample module shows two components: a ScribeLogger component that encapsulates the calls to the Scribe API behind a simple Logger service interface, and a HelloWorld component that uses an SCA reference wired to the ScribeLogger component to log the string that it's given. See the README file for build and test instructions."
