   "Well, NIO ByteBuffer is the most horrible interface in java. Whoever", 
   "invented the flip() interface - and a buffer where you can't know where", 
   "it starts and where it ends and where is the data - should be ashamed...", 
   "The only way we can use the buffer is by keeping track of start and end", 
   "as before, anything that uses position() or limit() will never know if", 
   "it's reading or writting or if the buffer has flipped.", 
   "The use of ByteBuffer is still a good thing - if you ignore the stupid", 
   "interface, as is the only way to work with direct and mapped byte[], and", 
   "maybe in a smarter VM get some buffers that are not relocated. It is", 
   "also usefull because it can work with the usefull parts of nio - like", 
   "charset and channels."
