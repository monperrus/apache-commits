   "Major overhaul of the validation API:",

   "- moved caching and automatic schema detection directly as extensions of the Validator", 
   "- modified Jing and Xerces implementation to work with the modified API", 
   "This should make life easier for people using validators. That said, this is currently UNTESTED.", 
   "I just want to commit those before (as I always do) I loose all my work.",
