   "[HBASE-6741] [0.89-fb] Detect duplicate assignments more accurately.", 
   "Author: aaiyer", 
   "Summary:", 
   "We have seen cases where multiple notifications from ZK about a", 
   "region being OPENED at a particular RS, results in the master", 
   "believing that the region is duplicately assigned -- even though", 
   "both the notifications mention the same RS (in the data).", 
   "There are two ways to fix this:", 
   "- detect and fix why we are seeing multiple notifications, and/or", 
   "- fix the duplicate assignment logic to handle multiple notifications", 
   "from the same server.", 
   "This diff does the latter. Whenever a region is opened, we cache the location", 
   "of where the region is opened. If we get a second notification for region", 
   "being opened at the same server, then we will not consider it to be a", 
   "duplicate notification.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "Add a test using injection handler framework to duplicate the", 
   "region opened events.",
