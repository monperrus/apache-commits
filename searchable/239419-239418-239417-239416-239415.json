   "Started to implement a resource tracking facility in the PSGenerator. It tracks resources such as EPS files, procset etc. as PSResource instances.", 
   "Resource-DSC comments are now generated.", 
   "Procsets moved into the Prolog where they belong.", 
   "Font setup is no longer a resource as it is not interchangeable between rendering runs. It's now just setup code with FOP-specific comments surrounding it.", 
   "In the future, this may also make it possible to write a size-optimized PS file from which the resources are stripped while writing the file. These resources will then be installed directly on a printer or inserted into the Prolog by a post-processor."
