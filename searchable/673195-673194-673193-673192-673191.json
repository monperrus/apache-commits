   "* src/rivet.h: added macro STRNEQU(s1,s2) which efficiently", 
   "compares 2 strings. Unlike STREQU(s1,s2) this new macro compares", 
   "at most strlen(s2) characters.", 
   "* src/TclWeb.h: added charset field to TclWebRequest. This new", 
   "property gets initialized to NULL every time this structure", 
   "is instantiated. If used it stores a pointer to a string that", 
   "specifies a header value fragment for the page being generated.", 
   "* src/apache-2/TclWebapache.c: request_rec is treated as an", 
   "opaque structure and the field 'content_type' is set by calling", 
   "the ap_set_content_type apache core function", 
   "* src/apache-2/mod_rivet.h: a 'honor_header_only_reqs' is added", 
   "to the rivet_server_conf for handling of the", 
   "HonorHeaderOnlyRequests configuration option", 
   "* src/apache-2/mod_rivet.c: Every content_type is checked", 
   "for possible charset specifications. When found this is", 
   "stored in the TclWebRequest structure to be processed later.", 
   "If a script or template doesn't set a content type on its own (with", 
   "the 'headers type <ctype>' command) the charset is written in", 
   "the http headers. Added support for the 'HonorHeaderOnlyRequests'", 
   "switch. Other minor changes include better code formatting", 
   "in some functions and commenting out some cruft left around."
