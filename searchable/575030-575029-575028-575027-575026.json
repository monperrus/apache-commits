   "Fix a couple of issues with the LDAP filter most noticeably, attributes where limited to [a-zA-Z ] so didn't allow for e.g., numbers. Furthermore, I added some functionality to match the 4.1 spec (values may now be Collections not only Vectors). Thanks goes to Angelo van der Sijpt and Jorg Hollenberg for providing me with valuable test cases (and pointing out the diff between the 4.0 and 4.1 spec)."
