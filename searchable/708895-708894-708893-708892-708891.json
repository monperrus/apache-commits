   "r703017 broke SSL with the JIO connector on Windows (and possibly other platforms). The problem was that some settings don't make sense for an SSL socket so rather than ignoring them a SocketExcpetion is thrown. With this patch, only attributes set by the user are passed to the socket and if setting the attribute throws an exception it is logged as an error."
