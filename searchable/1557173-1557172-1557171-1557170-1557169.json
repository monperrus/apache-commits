   "Oracle found a problem whereby if an event was received immediately following a render that triggered a renderredirect (like an initial render could) then the render redirect state managed on the session wasn't being used in the event.  Fix was to add same logic as in Render whereby the additional state is wrapped into a new request that is fed into Faces."
