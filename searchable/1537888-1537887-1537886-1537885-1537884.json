   "DERBY-5823: Multi-row insert fails on table without generated keys with RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS", 
   "The fix contains two parts:", 
   "1. Don't collect generated keys if the statement does not actually", 
   "generate key values. (This is the fix for the reported problem.)", 
   "2. Cache the array of generated key columns between executions. In the", 
   "existing code, the array of key columns was created only on the", 
   "first execution. Since it wasn't cached, it was null on all", 
   "subsequent executions. When it is null, all columns are collected", 
   "into the temporary row holder, which wastes space. Now, only the", 
   "key columns are collected, also on re-execution.", 
   "The test case was contributed by Kristian Waagan."
