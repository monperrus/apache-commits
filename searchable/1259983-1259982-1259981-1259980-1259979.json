   "Cleaning up lots of code, fixing some bugs, tweaking the API for List/Scroller, and tweaking the kinetics for Scroller.", 
   "Major API changes are:", 
   "1) Got rid of scrollAxis on IViewport.  We now just use horizontalScrollPolicy/verticalScrollPolicy.", 
   "2) No more overlay for horizontalScrollPolicy/verticalScrollPolicy.  Instead, we just key off of inputMode=\"touch\" to determine this", 
   "3) spark.events.TouchScrollEvent moved to mx.events.TouchScrollEvent", 
   "4) Added new API to help with testing: mx.utils.GetTimerUtil.mx_internal::getTimerFunction", 
   "We now use the distance scrolled as well as the velocity of that scroll to determine how far to throw the list", 
   "QE notes: Added new API for testing purposes",

   "SDK-26752 - error string no longer appears for Spark or MX components", 
   "The errorString was getting set in MXML. At that time, the component is not parented and not hooked up to its styles. So the call to get the showErrorTip style was returning false.", 
   "I moved this logic to commitProperties which solves the timing issue.", 
   "SDK-26497 - Spark Form displays errors in a seemingly random order", 
   "Changed the dictionary of invalid elements into a sorted array.", 
   "An element's sort order is based on its position in the display list tree using a depth first search. The position is represented by a Vector.<int>, with each item being the child index of the element's ancestor at that depth. For example, the second child of the first child of the root would have a Vector like this [0,0,1].", 
   "Whenever an element is invalid, we add it to the sorted array and perform a re-sort. We can live with using a heavy data structure like a Vector of ints because there should only be a few errors at a time in a Form. The alternative is to traverse the entire tree and store a pointer and the sort order for each node.", 
   "We make an assumption that the order in the display list tree is equivalent to the visual order of the Form's input controls. Since the Form's layout is based on VerticalLayout, this is a valid assumption. This same algorithm would work if the Form was switched to a horizontal layout.", 
   "SDK-26697 - Cannot reset Spark Form to original state if form had validation errors", 
   "Added logic to Form to listen for the errorStringChanged event on an invalid element. We don't use the same technique as in FormItem, which listens for errorStringChanged in the capture phase on the FormItem's contentGroup. This is because FormItem's errorString is set to the combined errorStrings of its children. If Form used the same technique, the error strings would appear twice.",
