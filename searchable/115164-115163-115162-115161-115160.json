   "Created new plugin-parent/ directory which contains all build configuration that must be inherited by the plugin projects. Plugins should no longer inherit from ../project.xml but rather from ../plugin-parent/project.xml. This is required because the top level project.xml file is reserved for the master build which contains additional build configuration that must not inhertied by the plugin projects (for ex, dashboard config, multichanges config,  multiprojects config, etc). I'll now modify the plugin's project.xml so that they extend ../plugin-parent/project.xml"
