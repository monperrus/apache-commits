   "Added method and parameter level unit tests, modified the model classes to implement the correct defaults.",

   "** empty constructor  -- primarily for the case of building model from WSDL -- this still needs some work", 
   "** constructor with (RequiredAnnotation,  required defaults, List<Annotations> optional annotations, more arguments).  The first argument is the required annotation for the model object (e.g. @webmethod for method, but for case of WebParam, it may NOT be null), followed by other required arguments for the class, followed the list of optional annotations,",
