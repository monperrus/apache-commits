   "The flag tells TLF that we want TLF1.1 compatibility for the selection length.  Pre TLF2, the selection length was textFlow.length-1 and did not include the final paragraph terminator.  For TLF2, the selection length is textFlow.length which includes the final paragraph terminator.", 
   "- When auto-sizing RET, if the unscaled width/height differs from the last unscaled width/height, redraw the background.  The EditManager calls updateAllControllers() directly when there is interactive input such as typing or cut/paste. This bypasses our update cycle which matters if we are auto-sizing.  compositionWidth/Height are NaN and the background is drawn with the old width/height because measureTextSize hasn't had a chance to update the layout manager yet.  Once the layoutManager has been updated, the compositionWidth/Height are still NaN so TLF doesn't think there is anything to compose.  The text hasn't changed shape, but the background has.", 
   "For TLF1.1 this was not necessary for most cases but there were some cases it should have been done and this was a bug.  TLF changed TextContainerManager.updateContainer() so now it is an issue for all cases.  It used to call compose() and it no longer does.",

   "Also, modified the projects such that the spark and framework projects may be imported together to FB without any other projects by having them depend on the swcs in the libs folder rather than the projects. However, other projects that depend on spark and framework will depend on the projects still. Thus, you must import spark and framework projects before importing the others.",
