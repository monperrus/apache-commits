   "Summary of Changes:", 
   "1) Added a new property \"javax.outbound.response.webmethod.exception\" that contains the Exception thrown", 
   "from a web service implementation.  This property is only available on the outbound server response, and", 
   "is provided so that a customer can access the exception in a jax-ws handler.", 
   "2) Changed the AddNumberWithHandlers sample to test and verify the new code.  The service is changed to", 
   "throw both checked and unchecked exceptions.  An outbound jaxws handler uses the new property to", 
   "access the exception and add the stack trace to the faultString.  (This is one of the scenarios that", 
   "the customer will use).  The client verifies proper processing.", 
   "3) Also added a test to verify that this property does not hinder message context persistence.", 
   "We don't necessarily need to support persistence of this property...the test only ensures that the new", 
   "property does not break persistance."
