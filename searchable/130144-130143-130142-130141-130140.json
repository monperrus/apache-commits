   "Fix for Bug 19860: Modified Base64 to remedy non-compliance with RFC 2045.  Non-Base64 characters were not being discarded during the decode.  RFC 2045 explicitly states that all characters outside of the base64 alphabet are to be ignored.  A new function discardNonBase64 is called prior to a decode.  Note that isArrayBase64 only discards whitespace before testing the contents of an encoded byte array.  Unit tests for Base64 were updated to reflect the changes related to discarding non-Base64 characters."
