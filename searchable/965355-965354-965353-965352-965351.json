   "backport change #965317 from trunk to 10.6 branch.", 
   "Previous change did not completely solve the problem. There is a problem with", 
   "the initial fix, not sure why it only showed an error in the 10.3 backport.", 
   "The temporary tables are stored in the transaction context, so using a nested", 
   "transaction creates a new context and the work there is not reflected in the",

   "the commit. The delay solves the issue of attempting to do work in a", 
   "prepared transaction.",

   "the time of an xa end the system \"Ends the work performed on behalf of a transaction branch. The resource manager disassociates the XA resource from the transaction branch specified and lets the transaction complete.\" Given this", 
   "description of the behavior of XAResource it seems reasonable to document", 
   "that global temporary tables are not supported across the XA commit boundary.", 
   "In the worst case one might be connecting to an resource in completely another", 
   "database and the temp table implementation is tied to the transaction", 
   "context in a single connection to a existing server."
