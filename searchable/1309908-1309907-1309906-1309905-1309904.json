   "The problem was that the $title property was used for 2 different things in the velocity template: the title and the name of the last breadcrumb. They want different titles. The page title should include the project name, but the breadcrumb should not. I solved this by a adding a new property called $shortTitle that is now used by the breadcrumb generation."
