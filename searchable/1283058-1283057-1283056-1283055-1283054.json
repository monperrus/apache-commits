   "Because TLF does not have the concept of \"auto\" fontLookup like we have at the Flex-level, we have had to rework the meaning of the fontLookup attribute so it is possible to have spans with device text in a component whose fontLookup is \"embeddedCFF\" without requiring fontLookup \"device\" to be explicitly specified for those spans.", 
   "For Spark text components, the default fontLookup has been changed from \"auto\" to \"embeddedCFF\".  The default fontFamily is \"Arial\".", 
   "If the component level fontLookup either defaults to \"embeddedCFF\" or is explicitly set to \"embeddedCFF\", for each element that is not explicitly set to fontLookup \"device\", it will first look for the embedded font, and failing that, will fail back to the device font.  All fonts for a given text component must be in the same swf context.", 
   "If the component-level fontLookup is \"device\" or the component-level fontFamily is not found in the swf context, the font lookup for all elements in the component will revert to \"device\".", 
   "If the player doesn't find the device font it will fallback to one of the builtin default fonts.", 
   "QE notes: probably need some new mustella tests to cover all the cases - 5 RichText truncation tests fail but I'm not sure this change has anything to do with that",
