   "The following changes were made to change the echo sample", 
   "to be generated from a wsdl file.", 
   "1) Added a samples/echo/InteropTest.wsdl that", 
   "contains the White Mesa Round 2 and Round 2 B", 
   "operations, our service stanza, and the echoMap/echoMapArray", 
   "operations.", 
   "2) Changed build.xml to define the wsdl2java task and", 
   "run wsdl2java on the samples/echo/InteropTest.wsdl.", 
   "3) Changed samples/echo/TestClient to remove deprecated", 
   "\"soap action\" options.  Also changes were made", 
   "to comply with the generated java beans.", 
   "4) Small change to the deploy.wsdd.  This checked in file", 
   "will continue to be used for service deployment.", 
   "5) Removed the checked in samples/echo/Echo*.java files", 
   "and the samples/echo/SOAP*.java files.  These are", 
   "now generated.", 
   "6) Improved the equals() generation in the JavaBeanWriter", 
   "to properly handle input Objects that are of the wrong", 
   "class and handle array properties.", 
   "7) Fixed the test/encoding and test/functional tests to", 
   "use the appropriate samples.echo.SOAP* constructors.", 
   "FYI NOTE: There are a number of failures in Sam's nightly interop", 
   "test.  I tracked these down to Tom's changes on 4/5", 
   "More commits to follow."
