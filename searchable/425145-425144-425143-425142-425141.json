   "Added a crude but (so far) effective debugger-friendly loader, designed so that files to be loaded with <script/> tags _after_ they (and, significantly, files on which they depend via dojo.require()) have been Dojo-loaded.", 
   "This is redundant, but acceptable for debugging.", 
   "There are two mechanisms for adding a file to the list of ones accessible to the debugger (tested with Venkman, but should hold true otherwise).  Either a specific list of classes can be provided to Xap after Xap.js is read in, but before bootstrapping, via (e.g.):", 
   "<script ...>Xap.addDebuggables(\"xap.bridges.dojo.DojoButtonBridge\",\"xap.taghandling.AbstractTagImpl\");</script>", 
   "and then a second parameter is given to Xap.bootstrap()---anything but the string \"debugAll\".  These files, and only these files, will then be loaded with script tags.", 
   "Otherwise, you can invoke Xap.bootstrap(<path>, \"debugAll\"), in which case every file loaded with Xap.require() during bootstrapping will be reloaded via <script/>s."
