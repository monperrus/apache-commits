   "Revised Ant scripts for building SWCs, in preparation for having additional locales.", 
   "1. Each locale-specific directory (such as bundles/en_US) inside a SWC project (such as frameworks/project/framework) no longer has its own Ant script for building the resource SWC for that locale (such as frameworks/locale/en_US/framework_rb.swc). This wouldn't scale well when there are many locales, because the scripts would all be the same except for the locale. So instead, the project's main Ant script (e.g., frameworks/project/framework/build.xml) now handles building both the project's code SWC and all of its associated resource SWCs.", 
   "2. The .properties files are no longer inside a 'src' subdirectory. For example, core.properties is now at bundles/en_US/core.properties rather than at bundles/en_US/src/core.properties. Otherwise, with the build.xml and build.properties for each locale gone, there would be nothing in a directory like builds/en_US except for 'src'.", 
   "3. A SWC project's Ant script now uses the custom Ant task <compc>, loaded from the JAR lib/flexTasks.jar that we build, to build its code and resource SWCs.", 
   "4. A SWC project's Ant script now sets FLEX_HOME, because <compc> requires this.", 
   "5. All paths within a SWC project's Ant script are now based on either basedir or FLEX_HOME.", 
   "6. A SWC project no longer requires its own build.properties file. Instead, it loads the top-level build.properties file (i.e., the one in FLEX_HOME). This isn't currently necessary, but it will give us a single place to define properties which can then be used in any project.", 
   "7. A SWC project with resources now has targets with names such as \"en_US\" and \"ja_JP\" for building the associated resource SWCs. They use a <antcall> to a private \"bundle\" target which expects \"locale\" to have been set as a parameter.", 
   "8. setup.sh now sets ANT_OPTS to -Xmx384m to give Ant sufficient heap for building the SDK.",
