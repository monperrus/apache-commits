   "o Fixed bash scripts (cygwin option was being tested incorrectly, and resulting in no such file: cygpath)", 
   "o Changed POM handling to use ArtifactMetadata API rather than direct Artifact construction for POMs", 
   "o Streamlined ArtifactDigestor to avoid use of byte arrays for transfer between methods (resulted in a bit of cut-and-paste code, but should run better)", 
   "o Pegged OutOfMemoryError to the ArtifactDigestVerifier/ArtifactDigestor combo (motivated the previous change)", 
   "o Cleaned up artifact source-file checking before creating any of the target directory structures", 
   "o Maybe works, maybe not...will resume testing tomorrow or the next day"
