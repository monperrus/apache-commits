   "Some refactoring of the sequence bank refill code: reorganized so that transaction management is inside the loop instead of out, causing each attempt to be in its own transaction to avoid doing mean things like locking and waiting; also added an extra synchronized block around the transaction that does the select/update/select stuff to protect it extra and avoid problems with waiting/sleeping; this is tested minimally and needs more thorough testng to see if it solved the problems seen"
