   "Put jar files installed in the JDK's jre/lib/ext directory after the jar files and classes bundled with Tomcat. This is done by setting the \"java.ext.dirs\" property to a zero length string and by put the JDK's jre/lib/ext directory in Tomcat's class loader. This also fixes the problem that used to happen when you had the JSSE jars installed as a system extension and you had JSSE_HOME set."
