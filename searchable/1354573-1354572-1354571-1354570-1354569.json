   "For release build, check that ADOBE_EXTENSION_MANAGER is defined (needed by frameworks/projects/flash-integration).  The flash-integration build script just skips building the .mxp file if the extension manager isn't there but we don't want to fail rather than skip the step for a release build.  Fix flash-integration clean which was leaving a file and a directory behind."
