   "Checkpoint the WSM work to produce an XML file that describes the mapping between a WSM web service (Java class) and a WSDL.  This is wired up at build time but isn't consumed at runtime yet.  The latter work is started but is more complex than I initially thought and is in great part commented out in ServiceDescriptionFactory.  Will continue this work after the 1.0.1 Beehive release is complete.",
