   "Based on a recent discussion on the dev mailing list, I've now refactored the entities and code to associate order items:", 
   "* OrderItemAssociation has been deprecated and renamed to OldOrderItemAssociation", 
   "* two new entities has been added: OrderItemAssoc and OrderItemAssocType", 
   "* all the code that was using the OrderItemAssociation entity has been modified to use the new entity", 
   "* added seed data for the OrderItemAssocType", 
   "Now the new entity can be used not only to store an association between a sales order item and a purchase order item, but also different kinds of relations, such as drop shipments, replacements, new versions of orders etc...", 
   "I'm going to commit (in my next commit) a service that can be used to migrate data from the old entity to the new ones."
