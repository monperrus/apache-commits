So now we simply let users add and remove subscriptions to groups by entering in feed urls and everything else is done for them.", 
   "We also get the added bonus of having newly added subscriptions being fetched when they are added rather than at some undertermined amount of time afterwards, so setting up new planets and groups can happen instantaneously now."
