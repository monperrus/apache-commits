   "PROTON-225: added new methods for Transport input and output which return ByteBuffers owned by Transport.", 
   "In contrast, the old deprecated input/output methods used byte arrays owned by the CLIENT.", 
   "Summary of changes:", 
   "- added new Transport methods: getInputBuffer, processInput, getOutputBuffer and outputProcessed", 
   "- the old Transport input/output methods are now deprecated", 
   "- the Python-to-proton-j binding now uses the new methods (note that the Python-to-proton-c binding still uses the old functions)", 
   "- added new methods to JNITransport. Implemented by calling the existing input/output methods for now.", 
   "- \"tests\" module now depends on proton-j-impl so it can use its encoder, decoder and test classes.", 
   "- improve exception handling in messenger.py", 
   "- consolidated all Python test pump functions", 
   "- increased ssl python test coverage to test ssl connection when client is allowed to connect unsecurely", 
   "- added configuration options to JythonTest allowing repeated test invocation and colorized output to be switched on.", 
   "Work done by Keith Wall <kwall@apache.org> and me."
