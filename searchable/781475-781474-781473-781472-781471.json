   "OPENJPA-1113 - Revert changes back to previous levels: Reflection:743396 & AbstractBrokerFactory 768588. I have verified that the latest changes associated to this issue did not caused any memory leak by observing/dumping the static cache sizes in the Reflection class. The emf.close() method cleared out the cache, i.e. HashMap.size() == 0. From looking at the memory usage of the JVM that invoked the test in persistence-jdbc module, the memory usage continues to grow even without the changes committed by this issue. Therefore there is some memory leak somewhere either in the test case or the provider code. The OOM condition only occurs with Sun JDK, IBM JDK works ok."
