   "Now, we're using all artifacts referenced by the plugin in the artifacts list for that PluginDescriptor...the only drawback is since we're not using a repository layout for the maven /lib, there is no good way to include the artifact-path from /lib...we're using the artifact-file from the local repo for those deps. This SHOULDN'T cause a problem, but it's possible..."

   "o Adding ${plugin.*} expression support for mojos. Specifically, added support for ${plugin.artifacts} to retrieve the plugin's classpath artifacts. NOTE: There may be artifacts which are FILTERED by the resolution process, since they are provided in the maven distro. NOT SURE HOW BEST TO RESOLVE THAT...but it'll cause problems with people forking certain mojos, undoubtedly.",
