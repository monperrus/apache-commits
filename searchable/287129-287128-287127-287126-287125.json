   "Fix for situation where an SSL connector is enabled but external dependencies (e.g. no .keystore file, etc.) are not correctly installed. Previous to this change, Tomcat would never invoke Lifecycle.start() if any connectors threw an exception. Hence, Tomcat appear to be hung.", 
   "With this change, Tomcat will now properly start all connectors that are properly configured and won't get hung up by any improperly configured connectors.", 
   "If desired, I can backport this change to the tomcat_40_branch for the upcoming 4.0.2 release."
