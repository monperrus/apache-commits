   "Fix build break on Windows. The error was \"undeclared identifier BUF_SIZE line 540\". The bug was that BUF_SIZE was declared in Channel.h in a #ifdef that excluded windows, but it was used on all platforms in Channel.cpp. The fix was simply to move the declaration of BUF_SIZE out of the #ifdef."
