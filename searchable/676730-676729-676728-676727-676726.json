   "OPENJPA-659: Dirty checking fails for runtime enhanced classes. The original case reported the failure in a Spring-Tomcat-Weaver with Embdded field. But as TestSimpleUnenhancedQuery can raise the same failure in a simpler settings. The fix is related to initializing a SaveFieldManager conditional to having loaded fields at invocation of saveFields(). The fix removes the condition and ensures that a SaveFieldManager is assocaited even when saveFields() is invoked without any field loaded."
