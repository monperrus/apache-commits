   "Improve handling of AI_ADDRCONFIG with getaddrinfo()", 
   "Using AI_ADDRCONFIG involves some unfortunate guesswork because it does not", 
   "consider loopback addresses when trying to determine if IPv4 or IPv6 is", 
   "configured (RFC 3493).", 
   "This is a problem if one actually wants to listen on or connect to the loopback", 
   "address of a protocol family that is not otherwise configured on the system.", 
   "Also, some implementations (glibc, cough) behave strangely if no other", 
   "addresses besides 127.0.0.1 and ::1 are configured.", 
   "A real fix would enhance apr_sockaddr_info_get's interface to allow the caller", 
   "to specify if he wants to use the address for listen() or connect(), and if he", 
   "wants to make the result dependant on the presence of non-loopback addresses.", 
   "Then apr_sockaddr_info_get could pass the right combination of AI_ADDRCONFIG", 
   "and AI_PASSIVE to getaddrinfo().", 
   "As a workaround, retry getaddrinfo() without AI_ADDRCONFIG in case of", 
   "EAI_ADDRFAMILY. This solves the most common problems but not all corner cases.",
