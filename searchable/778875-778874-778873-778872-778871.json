   "1. clearOldest() was called from inside a sync block. clearOldest() uses factory methods so must not be called from inside a sync block to prevent possible deadlocks.", 
   "2. clearOldest() calls allocate which set up a recursive call to allocate() which in turn emptied the allocation queue. This caused breakage as the recursive call unwound and items expected to be in the allocation queue were no longer there."
