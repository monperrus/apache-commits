   "A patche from Olivier Heintz for \"ProductStoreFacilities page does not refresh information after actions are performed\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-5408", 
   "The ProductStoreFacilities page does not refresh when actions are performed.  When adding or deleting a facility from the store, the result of either action is not reflected on the page even though both are performed.  A loading icon appears after clicking action buttons/links so AJAX is probably being used.", 
   "Olivier:", 
   "bug corrections :", 
   "1) areaId was wrong in on-event for edit and in delete button in list", 
   "2) replace wrong view-map ListProductStoreFacilityFormOnly by ListProductStoreFacility"
