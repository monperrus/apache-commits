   "Merged the fix for AXIS2-4034 (correct module version scheme) from trunk to 1.5 branch.", 
   "Note that only the first part (r777751) was merged. The second part (which improves the way the distribution is built) is not suitable for an interim release, and only the values of the xxx.mar.version properties have been fixed."
