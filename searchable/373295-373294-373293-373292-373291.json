   "Contributed by Bryan Pendleton", 
   "Attached is a proposed fix. derbyall passed. I put a small comment in the code. I didn't add any new tests, which is unfortunate, but I didn't have any brilliant inside about an easy way to add such tests. Testing with the server tracing is already somewhat of a PITA because the server tracing interacts poorly with things like the security manager."
