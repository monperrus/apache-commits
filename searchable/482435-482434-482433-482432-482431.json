   "DERBY-1758 (partial): Enable the lang/XMLBindingTest to run under a security", 
   "manager. Changes include all of the following:", 
   "- Updates lang/XMLBindingTest.java so that it will run under the default", 
   "testing security manager (i.e. removed the \"noSecurityManager()\" wrapper).", 
   "- Adds a new property, derbyTesting.jaxpjar, to the default testing policy", 
   "file. This property holds the location of the JAXP jar picked up from the", 
   "classpath _if_ that jar is external to the JVM. If the jar is either embedded", 
   "within, or \"endorsed\" by, the JVM then this property is unused.", 
   "The JAXP jar is then given permission to read the \"extin\" testing", 
   "directory, which is the directory into which the DTD required by XMLBindingTest", 
   "is copied (and thus JAXP has permission to read the DTD file).", 
   "- Adds a new static utility method, \"getJAXPParserLocation()\", to the", 
   "junit/XML.java file. This method instantiates a JAXP object and then uses", 
   "the implementation-specific class name to try to find out where the JAXP", 
   "jar is located.", 
   "- Modifies derbyTesing/junit/build.xml so that junit/XML.java will only", 
   "build with 1.4 JVMs and higher. This is required because junit/XML.java", 
   "now references a JAXP class that is not defined in 1.3.", 
   "- Updates the \"getURL()\" method of junit/SecurityManagerSetup.java to account", 
   "for situations where a class \"code source\" is null. Also updates the", 
   "\"determineClasspath()\" method of that class to set the derbyTesting.jaxpjar", 
   "property as appropriate.", 
   "- And finally, moves the build order of the derbyTesting/junit directory", 
   "so that it is built *before* the derbyTesting/harness directory."
