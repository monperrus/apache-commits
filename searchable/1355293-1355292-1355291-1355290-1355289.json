   "Render checkbox field as same behavior as radiobox (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4948): A patch from Leon: when rendering a radio field in form widget, the generated html codes looks like: <span><input type=\"radio\" ...>blahblah</span>. The radio box and its description are wrapped by <span> and it's easy to change css style for both of them (radio and description), not only for radio type input. But the check box is rendered in another way without <span> around."
