   "* \"Refactored and improved the way the information about inventory items created by a production run is retrieved in the form; also added the status of the inventory: this fixes a functional bug where defective inventory items were shown together with valid ones and it was not possible for the user to figure out if the planned quantity for the production run was fulfilled or not.\""
