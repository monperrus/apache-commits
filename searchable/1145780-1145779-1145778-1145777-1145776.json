   "* Don't pin the Neethi version but let Maven choose the right version based on transitive dependencies (currently Neethi 3.0.1-SNAPSHOT for Axis2 1.7.0-SNAPSHOT). This also has the advantage that we automatically inherit the exclusions defined on the Neethi dependency in Axis2 (to avoid a double dependency on Woodstox).", 
   "* SYNAPSE-788: Temporarily disabled the ThrottleMediatorTest because the throttle library is not compatible with the Neethi version used by Axis2."
