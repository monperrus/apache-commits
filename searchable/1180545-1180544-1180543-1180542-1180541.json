   "committing a schema 1.1 fix. started with fixing implementation to comply to the XSD 1.1 test case \"cta9003err\" (contributed by Saxonica). doing additional static checking of XPath expression, in XSDTypeAlternativeTraverser to abort processing and raise error, if for example a schema type used in the XPath expression isn't present in the XPath static context (which is been tested by the test case mentioned above).", 
   "have also done minor refactoring in other parts of code base (also in class XSTypeHelper, which is not related to the functional fix for this commit)."
