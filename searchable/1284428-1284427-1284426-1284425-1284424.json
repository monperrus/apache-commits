However, anytime the souce changes, we want to null out sourceLastPlayed.  This was causing a bug when someone set the source to null and then reset it to it\u2019s previous value.",

I had put in a fix so we weren\u2019t setting width/height on the underlying videoPlayer too many times, but apparently we need to make sure it always gets called once.  Hopefully when switching to Strobe we can cleanup this logic...I put a FIXME in to do this.",
