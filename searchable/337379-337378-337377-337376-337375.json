   "In the past Xalan-J interpretive (Xalan) and XSLTC both implemented their own", 
   "serialization stages.  Much of the code provides the same functionality.", 
   "In order to improve the maintainability of the code, and to eliminate any", 
   "functional differences, these two serializers are now merged in the", 
   "org.apache.xml.serializer package.", 
   "The best performing features of both have been used.  The class hierarchy", 
   "of serializers used by XSLTC is re-used for this reason. At the highest", 
   "level the serializer classes split based on whether the output of the", 
   "serializer is a \"Stream\" or whether it is a \"SAX\" handler.  After that", 
   "both major branches split based on the output type (e.g. XML, HTML or TEXT).", 
   "The external user interface of the old Xalan serializer has been kept.", 
   "Other classes and interfaces have been absorbed into the serializer", 
   "package to keep it independent of both Xalan and XSLTC. The primary", 
   "interface, SerializationHandler, accepts SAX and SAX-like calls, but", 
   "it also absorbs other interfaces from the old Xalan serializer."
