   "When calculating the path in AsyncContext.dispatch(), methods ServletRequest.getRequestURI and ServletRequest.getContextPath cannot be used. That's because the first one returns a string that is not decoded and not normalized, but the second one returns decoded string. Instead of this methods ServletRequest.getServletPath and ServletRequest.getPathInfo will be used as requestURI = contextPath + servletPath + pathInfo."
