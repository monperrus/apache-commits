   "1 - add a new call.invokeOneWay() that doesn't take any args - to match", 
   "the call.invoke().  Useful when you create the entire env manually", 
   "2 - add a new property to the msgContext that allows someone to tell", 
   "the client code to _not_ throw a fault when one is returned from", 
   "te server.  This allows an app to get the soap fault as XML instead", 
   "of as some Java exception.  Handy for gateways/intermediary type of", 
   "apps.", 
   "3 - create a new property isOneWay property on the MessageContext and", 
   "use it in favor of the Call one.  This allows the rest of the engine", 
   "access to this information and (coming soon) will allow a service", 
   "the ability to tell the engine that the operation was a one-way", 
   "(programmatically) so the Java provider should not automatically", 
   "generate a soap envelope and instead return a 202.", 
   "Along with this are the get/set methods for this new property.",

   "5 - remove a 'guess' in the messageContext.getPossibleOpsByQName code.", 
   "it incorrectly assumed that if the namespaces matched then it MUST", 
   "be a good matched - which just isn't the case."
