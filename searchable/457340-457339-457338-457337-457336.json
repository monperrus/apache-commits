   "Changed implementation of component map in MarkupContainer to an array model", 
   "like the validators changed.  This made a significant reduction in the size", 
   "of pages, especially big pages.  For example, nested shrank from 69,958 bytes", 
   "to 55,231 bytes which is a savings of 14,727 bytes that was due to HashMap", 
   "overhead.  Very large containers may run slower, but most containers are likely", 
   "to be faster as should be recursion/iteration.  The main downside is that this", 
   "code is very ugly and involves the same kinds of tests and casts that we did", 
   "to make the validators implementation more space efficient."
