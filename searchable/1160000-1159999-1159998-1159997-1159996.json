   "QPID-2720: make the PluginManager able to work with a pre-existing BundleContext", 
   "Manually applied patch from Danushka Menikkumbura (no longer applied after intervening commits), then updated PluginManager close() to always close the ServiceTrackers it creates, removed the static field/methods causing test failures which lead to previously reverting the patch, enabled passing a pre existing BundleContext into the Broker instance at startup instead, and finally removed the unused MockPluginManager."
