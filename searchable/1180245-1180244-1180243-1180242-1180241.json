   "NO-JIRA: update various tests to try and avoid their sporadic failure on the Jenkins persistent test runs due to the sometimes severe slowdowns on the Jenkins slaves", 
   "InfoPluginTest: correct the test to record receipt of the payload before tripping the countdown latch, ensuring the subsequent list size check in the main test thread doesnt fail because of scheduling.", 
   "AMQQueueDeferredOrderingTest: reduce the number of messages used during persistent runs, the test takes an excessive amount of time to complete and can fail if the storage is expecially slow.", 
   "ResetMessageListenerTest: increase the time allowed to receive the messages, the 1sec allowance can be insufficient on persistent runs if the storage is especially slow.", 
   "QueueDepthWithSelectorTest: ensure that a synchronous operation is performed before proceeding to later validate the queue depth on another session, ensuring that in persistent runs all the acks have first made it to the broker and been processed."
