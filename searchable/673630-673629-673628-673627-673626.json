   "The font-family params defined in document-to-fo.xsl were NOT available to this stylesheet, even though it is included after the param definitions.", 
   "I have thus added the param definitions here as well, to make the pdf generation in Dispatcher work again, but this is really a cludge that goes against the idea of putting the font-family specifications into params/variables instead of as hard-coded strings.",
