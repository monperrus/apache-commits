   "QPID-1735 : Added Documentation to QueueBackingStore around thread safety of load/unload, Updated FQBS to adhere to the thread safety specified by the interface.  QueueEntry was updated to return the AMQMessage from the load() to complete the getMessage() interface. As in a flowed state the message may be purged before a reference can be taken. Added new Test QueueEntryImplThreadingTest that should later be run for longer but aims to show that load always returns the message even when unloads are occuring asynchronously."
