   "Added functionality in BaseJetspeedLink to generate link to an existing portlet. This link will display portlet in specified mode (maximized, print friendly, etc). The portlet to link to may be identified via its js_peid or portlet name. If portlet name is used, its js_peid is derived from the first portlet with matching name.", 
   "In Velocity, use $jslink tool. In JSP, use portletlink tag which leverages of off JetspeedLink.",
