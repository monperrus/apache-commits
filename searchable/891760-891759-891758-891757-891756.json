   "This is a major changeset that adds support for localization of widgets, included localized start files, icons, names, licenses, and descriptions which can  be selected either using system default locales or by using a \"locale\" parameter REST API methods. This changeset affects database structure, beans, controllers, and the widget processing model. This fixes WOOKIE-79 and addresses many of the concerns of WOOKIE-67."
