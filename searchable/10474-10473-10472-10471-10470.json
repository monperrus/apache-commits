   "found that get_uri_list() can get called before check() which is what sets PerMsgStatus->{html}, which get_uri_list() was using to get the HTML parsed uris.  modified get_uri_list() to use the metadata directly, which is set.  also added a test to look for this type of thing.  also moved the scope of a variable in html_uri to where it was used, not the whole function."
