   "Update for MUSE-26. The feature works as described in that issue, with the following minor changes:", 
   "1. The name of the properties file is org.apache.muse.core.descriptor.ext.RequiredCapabilityImplementations", 
   "2. The keys of the file are still URIs, but users MUST take care to escape (with a backslash) the", 
   "colon (':') in each URI. The : is a Properties/ResourceBundle delimeter and this is the only", 
   "way to prevent these types from not parsing the full key value.", 
   "3. Depending on the app server/platform being used, there may be restrictions on where the JAR file", 
   "containing the properties file can be located. If the file is not being loaded, it is likely due", 
   "to differences in classloading precedence in the given platform; moving the JAR file to different", 
   "places (so it's loaded by different class loaders) may solve this."
