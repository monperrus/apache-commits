   "DERBY-2892: Closing a resultset after retrieving a large > 32665 bytes value with Network Server does not release locks.", 
   "Fixed the problem in an alternative way to avoid compatibility problems. Instead of explicitly closing the underlying LOB when creating streams etc, closing is now handled by the LOBStateTracker in the same way as if the LOB column had never been accessed by the user. Multiple result set getter methods can (again) be called on a LOB column, except for the getters returning streams.",
