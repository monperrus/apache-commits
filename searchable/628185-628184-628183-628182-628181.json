   "DERBY-3299 (incremental): Add several utility methods to", 
   "DDLSingleTableConstantAction.java that can be called by the various", 
   "ConstantAction subclasses to drop a constraint and/or a conglomerate", 
   "descriptor. In addition to performing the drop as before, these",

   "index necessitates the \"update\" of a shared physical conglomerate.", 
   "If so, the new methods will take the necessary steps to create", 
   "create a new (\"replacement\") physical conglomerate that correctly", 
   "satisfies all remaining conglomerate descriptors--i.e. all of the", 
   "ones that were sharing the dropped physical conglomerate.", 
   "Note that a) Derby does not currently have logic to recognize when", 
   "a shared physical conglomerate needs to be updated (that's coming", 
   "in a subsequent patch), and b) there are currently no calls to the", 
   "new utility methods.  Thus this commit should not have any effect", 
   "on Derby yet (incremental development)."
