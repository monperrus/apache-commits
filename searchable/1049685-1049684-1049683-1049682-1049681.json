   "allows header responses to flush their output (contribute a header-contribution tag to xml) in the call to IHeaderResponse.close()", 
   "this was originally possible in 1031432, but that commit had an obvious error of closing after a single component rendered head (my bad)", 
   "johan fixed that bug in 1040980, but this removed the possibility of contributing to the header response in close", 
   "now both things work", 
   "also updated javadocs to reflect that the header response has not thrown an error when accidentally calling render*** methods for a long time (it originally did)"
