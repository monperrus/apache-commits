   "Update to prevent the accessible name of components in form items from being cached and never updated.  This fixes the issue for Spark components and mx components that are not TextInput and TextArea.  This also solves late data binding issues which caused the accessible name to be empty.  Additional work is required in Player to fix the caching issue components.  This change should be merged into the trunk.",

   "Update accessibility naming logic.  When accessibility name is explicitly set use that name, otherwise use name provided by getName function in accImpl for component, else use toolTip for component (if present).  Form heading name and item name are still prepended with required field notation if they exist.  Form heading and form item logic now uses accessible name if set on those components including with string containing space is used to silence form heading or form item from being announced.
