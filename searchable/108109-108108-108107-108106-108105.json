   "This is a patch for bug #9669.  The NotifyPostmaster and NotifySender mailets unnecessarily parsed the headers of the mails being processed.  This led to exceptions that unnecessarily aborted the processing when the headers didn't contain valid data.  The attached files are changed so that the raw headers are accessed directly."
