   "[UIMA-2434] improvements to removing FS from indexes.  2 new public methods added for \"bulk\" removal of all instances of particular types (1 method does the type and all its subtypes, the other, just the type).  Fixed the sorted index item removal to use the binary search capability to speed up finding the item to be removed.  Augmented the IteratorTest.  Note: Bag indexes are still order n-squared, potentially, in doing removals; work-around: don't use bag indexes if you will be doing lots of removes (other than bulk - which are order-1)."
