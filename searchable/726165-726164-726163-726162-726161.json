   "FlexibleMapAccessor refactor - added Unified Expression Language support and a cache/factory method.", 
   "The UEL implementation is asymmetric - get() method calls are delegated to the UEL library, and put() and remove() method calls are implemented with internal classes. The reason is because FlexibleMapAccessor supports object creation during assignment and UEL does not. The UEL specification clearly states that assignment can only happen to existing variables. The JUEL library implements that - you can only assign values to existing variables.", 
   "I've spent several days testing this, but there is still a chance that something will break. I'll watch the dev mailing list closely and fix any problems as they come up."
