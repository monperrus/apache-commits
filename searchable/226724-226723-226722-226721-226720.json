   "http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JS2-318: Upgrading to Torque 3.2-rc1 and to OJB 1.0.3", 
   "In Torque 3.2-rc1 support for datatype BIT was dropped for Oracle.", 
   "Instead, (for Oracle) BOOLEANINT must be used.", 
   "This means that there is no single solution anymore (with Torque) for mapping a boolean to a database.", 
   "I can come up with only one solution which will work always on any db:", 
   "replace BIT by BOOLEANINT and change the OJB mapping to INTEGER together with a Boolean2IntFieldConversion.", 
   "This very likely also (finally!) solves very long outstanding issue: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JS2-160."
