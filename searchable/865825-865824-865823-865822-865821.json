   "This patch adds support for stalin scheme bindings. They are generated by a perl script (I know the irony) which requires File::Slurp & ectags.", 
   "There is also initial support for mzscheme bindings. Mzscheme bindings are generated by SWIG and are still in early developement.", 
   "This patch also adds chickenscheme to the build system. It does not build, don't try.", 
   "This patch shouldn't break the other bindings.", 
   "Important note: the build system (mostly automake) has stolen my brain. If you find it (or a pkg-config for libscheme) let me know.", 
   "Right now, it assume that escheme.h is in /usr/include/plt , this needs to be fixed.", 
   "Tests are non-existent (thanks to in part to my wasted attempts getting define-syntax in stalin, but thats another story),", 
   "but will be coming over time.", 
   "Overall, don't realy on these bindings just yet, but if you can provided any feedback that would be super awesome", 
   "[espicially anything about the build system]."
