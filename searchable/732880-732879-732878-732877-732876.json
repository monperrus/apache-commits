   "Removed some dead code in SOAPPartImpl. Indeed the \"source\" attribute is only read in getContent(), which first resets it before returning its (new) value. Also note that (1) storing a Source object is bad because some implementations can only be read once and (2) the way the Source is built in the constructor (using an InputStreamReader) is blatantly wrong because it doesn't take character encoding into account."
