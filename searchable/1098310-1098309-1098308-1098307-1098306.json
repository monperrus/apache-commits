   "A very rough first cut of the docbook build scripts. This does a few things:", 
   "1. Builds the pdf and html docs when you execute \"mvn site\"",

   "This module has not yet been tied into the main Cayenne pom and it is in a folder location designed to keep out of the way of the existing documentation. When it is complete, we can move it into a better location."
