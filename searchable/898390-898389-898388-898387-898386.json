   "Start of extension for handling WS-Policy policies. Based on policy-xml-ws but neither working nor in the build yet. It's currently still using the neethi model but this is wrapped in a Tuscany model now to allow us to break out and process assertions separately. Neethi currently has no function for matching so we need to cast around to see if that is available elsewhere."
