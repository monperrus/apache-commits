   "[UIMA-2210] update to latest Apache parent (version 10). include UIMA projectID in Jira URL (used by changes plugin). Update continuous integration info to Jenkins. Switch to uimaBuildResources version 2 (property change). Remove several version tags to allow inheriting from common apache parent pom.  Update to version 2.3 of maven dependency plugin.  Add java doc \"tags\" that are used, to avoid noisy warning messages.  Update felix bundle plugin to latest one minus 1 (because very latest mandates Java 6).  Incorporate changes from addons parent for building multiple binary targets for \"single-project\" distributions."
