   "QPID-3739: Java properties qpid.ssl.keyStoreCertType and qpid.ssl.trustStoreCertType have misleading names and would be better called qpid.ssl.[Key|Trust]ManagerFactory.algorithm", 
   "* Introduced two properties qpid.ssl.KeyManagerFactory.algorithm and qpid.ssl.TrustManagerFactory.algorithm to allow a client user to override the algorithm name used when Qpid client constructs a KeyManager or TrustManager.", 
   "* Continued to support qpid.ssl.keyStoreCertType and qpid.ssl.trustStoreCertType (now marked as deprecated)", 
   "* Introduced a new Java Broker configuration key connector/ssl/keyManagerFactoryAlgorithm", 
   "* Continued to support broker configuration key connector/ssl/certType (now marked as deprecated and will issue warning if used).", 
   "* Changed the default from hardcoded 'SunX509' to the value(s) returned by KeyManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm() and TrustManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm().  This allows the Java Broker and Client to be used out of the box on non-Sun JDKs without having to set qpid.ssl.KeyManagerFactory.algorithm or qpid.ssl.TrustManagerFactory.algorithm.", 
   "* Updated client docbook documentation.", 
   "Tested both Java Broker and Client on IBM JDK and ensured all 0-10 and 0-9-1 profiles pass (including SSLTest which was failing prior to this change)."
