   "Switching to development version of spring-osgi as I need to create some custom spring-osgi beans and it seem like a waste of time to base these on old code. The development version of spring-osgi is based on Spring 2.1 instead of 2.0, so I updated to Spring 2.1 as well.", 
   "* Spring 2.1 is packaged as OSGi bundles, so the wrapping bundles are not needed anymore.", 
   "* spring-osgi exposes as default each bundles context as a service. With the latest version of spring-osgi the context consists of numerous services, so I turned the off the default to make it easier to find the Cocoon services when listing services.", 
   "* The configuration syntax for referring to 1..n cardinality beans is changed."
