   "A refactored patch from Leon for \"Bug introduced by OFBIZ-4769, it makes <entity-one> failed if the context contains incorrect data\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-5148", 
   "How to reproduce:", 
   "1. open \"https://demo-trunk.ofbiz.apache.org/partymgr/control/editpartygroup?create_new=Y\" (try to create a new party group)", 
   "2. input any words in group name field, input any \"incorrect\" non-digits characters (e.g. \"abcd\" blah blah) to field \"Annual revenue\"", 
   "3. click save", 
   "It leads to an \"exception\" page instead of original input form with error message.", 
   "I digged some codes and found it's related to r1426231 commit (of OFBIZ-4769).", 
   "jleroux: the logic of code seemed good to me, I just refactored the cod a bit (in a previous refactoring attempt I missed the point that parametersObjExists might not be present. This new code is a simplified version of what does setAllFields internally. The PK fieldValues are set before being possibly overriden by context values. There is no Map casting. I tested the previous issues, all are resolved."
