   "minor changes for testing", 
   "In order to make parts of the remote cache easier to test, I had to make some minor interface changes.", 
   "I added a get attributes method to the auxiliary cache interface.  This made it necessary to change a few other files.", 
   "I added a new IRemoteCacheClient interface, so I could mock it out and test the remote cache no wait by itself.", 
   "To get started, I created a few new simple tests for the remote cache.", 
   "The test coverage is still not very good, but it is up to 57% from 54%.", 
   "I also improved javadocs in several places.", 
   "In addition, I removed an unused class in the remote package.", 
   "I started to take measures to standardize the interface naming convention.", 
   "I don't like the \"I prefix, but there are too many to make it worth chaning.", 
   "In a subsequent release, we should deprecate the 3 or 4 interfaces that do not follow the I convention"
