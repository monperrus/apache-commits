   "FLUME-292: Refactor OutputFormat and OutputFormatBuilder to better support plugin authoring", 
   "- Added an abstract class that implements OutputFormat and provides support", 
   "for injecting a reference to the builder so we can get at output format", 
   "metadata.", 
   "- Require OutputFormat impls to be able to accept an injected", 
   "OutputFormatBuilder and to be able to later provide it to code that needs", 
   "access to metadata.", 
   "- Removed getFormatName() - we now rely on the *Builders (which are more like", 
   "descriptors with factory support).", 
   "- Updated FormatFactory to not instantiate output format builders excessively.", 
   "- Allowed Eclipse to reformat code to be inline with other code.", 
   "- Updated existing output formats to conform to the changes in OutputFormat", 
   "and OutputFormatBuilder.", 
   "- Fixed all instances of direct instantiation of DebugOutputFormat. With the", 
   "need to inject the OutputFormatBuilder instance now, skipping the factory", 
   "builder() method results in an incorrectly configured instance.", 
   "- Places that used to use OutputFormat#getFormatName() now use", 
   "OutputFormat#getBuilder().getName().", 
   "- Updated many of the output format implementations to extend", 
   "AbstractOutputFormat to gain support for builder instance injection.", 
   "- Allowed Eclipse to reformat files to bring them into line with the rest of", 
   "the code base. Seems like most folks are wrapping long lines, but we should", 
   "share formatting rules.", 
   "- Updated declaration to use the interface type rather than the impl.", 
   "- Made AvroNativeFileOutputFormat FLUME-292 compatible.", 
   "- Changed ConsoleEventSink's println()s to logger output.", 
   "- Added a missing license header.",
