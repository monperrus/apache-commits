   "Changes javac to use target attribute of 1.1.  Per the Ant documentation: \"Generate class files for specific VM version (e.g., 1.1 or 1.2). Note that the default value depends on the JVM that is running Ant. In particular, if you use JDK 1.4+ the generated classes will not be usable for a 1.1 Java VM unless you explicitly set this attribute to the value 1.1 (which is the default value for JDK 1.1 to 1.3). We highly recommend to always specify this attribute.\""
