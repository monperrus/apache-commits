   "HIVE-1040 [jira] use sed rather than diff for masking out noise in diff-based",

   "(Marek Sapota via John Sichi)", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Replace diff -I with regex masking in Java", 
   "The current diff -I approach has two problems:  (1) it does not allow resolution", 
   "finer than line-level, so it's impossible to mask out pattern occurrences within", 
   "a line, and (2) it produces unmasked files, so if you run diff on the command", 
   "line to compare the result .q.out with the checked-in file, you see the noise.", 
   "My suggestion is to first run sed to replace noise patterns with an", 
   "unlikely-to-occur string like ZYZZYZVA, and then diff the pre-masked files", 
   "without using any -I.", 
   "This would require a one-time hit to update all existing .q.out files so that", 
   "they would contain the pre-masked results.",
