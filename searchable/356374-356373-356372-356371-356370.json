   "Added/enhanced examples around the use of css in the structurer. Tested with css the first non-markup language in the structurer. As well firstly tested the new xml based property system instead of the xsl. Contracts could taken default variables for given till now where the contract author still can use default properties but have to request them like  <xsl:param name=defaultVariables select=test.html/> <xsl:variable name=path select=/*/*[@name=path]/@value/>. This makes it possible to use this properties in a wider range of languages besides xsl."
