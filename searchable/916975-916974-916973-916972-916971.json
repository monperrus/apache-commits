   "Store the \"original\" name of the mail in the MailMessage so we can lookup it later to remove the mail from the spool if needed. This is needed because some mailets (like RemoteManager) change the name of the mail and so it will never remove the mail from the spool (because of using the \"wrong name\"). Thx to Manuel for spotting this!"
