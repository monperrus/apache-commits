   "Even more improvements for STANBOL-468 :", 
   "- Reduced OWLAPI <-> Clerezza conversions.", 
   "- Session is cleared even when the refactoring job fails.", 
   "- All entity signatures retrieved from the Entity Hub or other sources are merged together before they are added to the session (TODO check if merging is \"OWL-safe\" e.g. it is not introducing one owl:Ontology resource too many).", 
   "- Small fixes in resource release during deactivation (TODO I think this type of deactivation could be too aggressive).", 
   "Overall it should be safer, faster, occupy much less disk space and save some more lines of code."
