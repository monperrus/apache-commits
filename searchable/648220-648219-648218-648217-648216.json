Also replaced purgeQueue with checkQueuesClean as the tests should ensure they have tidied up.. if they haven't then something has gone wrong. So purging will just hide that issue. Used a second connection in the QBAAT to validate the messages to be sure they are still there. This also fixes the issues with Transacted and ClientAck where the messages would of course go back on the queue as no ack or commit were performed. Using a new connection is also cleaner as it ensures the queue browsing has no side effects for other users of the system.",
