   "Pb: If OFBiz is deployed on 2 servers in Load Balancing Mode, SequenceUtil will generate duplicate IDs because synchronization is done at JVM level instead of doing it in DB.", 
   "The OFBIZ-2353 SELECT FOR UPDATE solution.patch provides a simple mean to quickly resolve this issue. I did not remove the bank loop (useless since there is a DB contention).", 
   "I created a cluster general property. But since, most of the time, when you use a cluster you use also a sole database with a delegator having distributed-cache-clear-enabled set to true, I retrieve this information to automatically use SELECT FOR UPDATE in this case", 
   "This has been tested on a cluster with JMeter. BTW I found that UserLoginHistory can throw errors because it does not use a SeqId in PK but only login+fromDate. I guess there are other cases like that but in reality it's unlikely that someone log on 2 diff machines with the  same login at the same time (ms), just a JMeter side effect..."
