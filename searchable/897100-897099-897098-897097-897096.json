   "Minor renaming of a few content-inspection types and methods. Added default weights for the content inspectors to jspwiki.properties. Removed the listener code from the Inspection class. The code was good and it worked nicely, but it is no longer needed due to the way we integrate CAPTCHA now. We can always add listeners back if we have to, but in the meantime: a simpler API is a better API."
