   "Change the ControlBeanContext object to delegate to an instance of the java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextServices interface.  This change makes it possible to have the CBC object itself delegate to an instance of BeanContextServices to receive functionality captured in the BeanContext, BeanContextChild, and BeanContextServices interfaces.", 
   "Any existing applications that used this class should have compatible behavior as long as they used methods from the interfaces in java.beans.beancontext rather than from the implementation classes.  Otherwise, existing CBC users will need to port to these interfaces.  But, you'd never code to an internal impl from your applications, would you?  :)",
