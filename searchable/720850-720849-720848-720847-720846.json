   "Added support for SVG 1.2 inside fo:instream-foreign-object. The code just used the basic SVGDOMImplementation for SVG 1.1. Now it delegates the DOM building to Batik code instead of to a normal DOM builder.",

   "Fix for unit test failure in transcoder tests (NullPointerException):", 
   "Have to pass the root PSGraphics2D to NativeTextHandler instead of the PSGenerator as this one hasn't been initialized in PSGraphics2D when the NativeTextHandler is built in AbstractPSTranscoder.",

   "Fixed possible ClassCastException that was caused by my earlier attempt to support SVG 1.2. Batik's SAXSVGDocumentFactory doesn't currently deal well with the case when namespaces are declared outside of its scope. Worked around that by doing the SVG version detection in FOP code. SVG12DOMImplementation is obtained by reflection in order to keep backwards compatilibility with earlier Batik versions that don't support SVG 1.2.",
