   "[MASSEMBLY-222] Sorry for the huge commit. This rearranges the integration tests to pull from local repo to the testing local repo where possible, and copies the test projects to target/test-classes before running, to avoid pollution of the sources. It also changes the interpolation of outputDirectory and outputFileNameMapping, such that pom.artifactId refers to the main project being built, while artifact.artifactId refers to the dependency currently being processed (and module.artifactId is a synonym for artifact.artifactId when processing modules. Also adjusted the unit tests to be less fragile in the face of minor changes in the call structure to things like Artifact instances, to reduce the rippling failures from minor debug statements."
