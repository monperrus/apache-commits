   "More complete fix to the easing class inclusion/build problem. For one thing, we do not need the entries in Flex4Classes.as since we are bringing the classes in via the manifest declarations. Also, I added the Linear and Sine classes, which are included implicitly, but which need to be called out in the manifest to make them available as top-level MXML tags. Finally, I needed to add these same declarations to both the gumbo and 2009 manifests to make them available to all of these namespaces.",
