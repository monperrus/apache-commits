   "Fixed a problem with percent constraints being restored properly after effects were run. The problem was that multi-target effects would apply end values before all instances were done running, so some values would be clobbered. For example, when we reset to percent width, we would sometimes clobber it and set an explicit width again before the other instances ended, thus blowing away the proper constraint value.",
