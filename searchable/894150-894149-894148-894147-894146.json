   "Applied a modified patch from jira issue OFBIZ-3211 - Ajaxifying lookup fields.", 
   "To add ajax support to a lookup screen, you have to add two fields: entityName and searchFields. As a reference please check LookupPartyName and LookupPerson screens in party manager. You can see ajaxed lookups in action in any screen using form widgets and the above lookup screens (findInvocies screen in accounting for example).", 
   "This commit also fixes a bug in controls.js from scriptaculous library, but I reported it in its project list and I will track it further.", 
   "To hide the returned values (shown as [ID])from the autocompleter or change the number of items there, you have to modify widget.properties"
