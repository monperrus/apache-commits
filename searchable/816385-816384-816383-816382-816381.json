   "Replace PriorityQueue mess with a CompactionIterator that efficiently yields compacted Rows from a set of sstables by feeding CollationIterator into a ReducingIterator transform.  (\"Efficiently\" means we never deserialize data until it is needed, so the number of sstables that can be compacted at once is  virtually unlimited, and if only one sstable contains a given key that row data will be copied over without an intermediate de/serialize step.) This is a very natural fit for the compaction algorithm and almost entirely gets rid of duplicated code between doFileCompaction and doAntiCompaction.",
