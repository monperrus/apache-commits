   "If the file specified by SSLMutex cannot be created (because the directory      does not exist for example), children will segfault on init without giving      any reason that the user can figure out.  This happens because the module       init in the parent never checks to see if the mutex intialization succeded.     This patch adds this check and a user-friendly error message.",
