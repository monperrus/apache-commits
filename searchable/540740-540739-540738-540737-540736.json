   "DERBY-1816 (partial): Pre-patch \"cleanup\" that does the following:", 
   "1) Replaces each of the recyclable Date, Time, and Timestamp arguments", 
   "with a recyclable java.util.Calendar object in client/am/Cursor.java.", 
   "2) Modifies the relevant code in client/am/DateTime.java to call methods", 
   "on the recyclable Calendar object instead of on Date, Time, and", 
   "Timestamp objects. The benefit to doing this is that we are now using", 
   "non-deprecated methods.", 
   "Note that even with this patch we are still creating a new instance of", 
   "Time/Timestamp/Date for each method--the cleanup patch does not change that.", 
   "Instead, the cleanup patch adds the instantiation of a new Calendar object", 
   "(one per client/am/Cursor) and then (re-)uses that object to replace the", 
   "deprecated calls."
