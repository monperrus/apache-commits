   "Added registrations of artifact processors under META-INF/services. Bootstrapping code can now just get them from the artifact processor extension points instead of creating them manually. Added default constructors expected by the artifact processor loaders to the artifact processors that didn't have them. Moved model resolver out of definitionsprocessor to allow it to be instantiated like the other processors. Cleaned up setup methods in most test cases that used artifact processors now that they don't need to create their own copies of the processors. Simplified the initialization of the runtime builder a bit as it can just get the artifact processors from the registry as well."
