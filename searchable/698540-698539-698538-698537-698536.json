   "Message.writeTo() prematurely closed output stream if transfer encoding is BASE64 (MIME4J-79)", 
   "Patch kindly provided by Markus Wiederkehr and Oleg Kalnichevski.", 
   "The only change from the proposed patch is the \"closed = true\" when \"len < 0\" (in Base64OutputStream) because len == -1 is the way we are notified of a stream end and writing more data would result in corrupted output, so it seems safer to consider the stream closed after that call."
