   "Fixed issue with serialization exceptions on shutdown and startup: the RequestHandler class no longer implements serializable, it was never serializable anyway because it has member fields of types ServletContext, ViewFactory, and EventFactory which are not serializable; I tried making those transient or removing them to load dynamically after a bunch of changes realized that it doesn't make sense to serialize this class anyway, it contains no useful data that a user would care about, and all of its information comes from configuration files that we would want to reload on a restart or in another system or whatever"
