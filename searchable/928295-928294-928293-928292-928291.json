   "In order to fix issues after issues, I commit this patch from Sascha Rodekamp that fixes \"Allow to open a layer lookup from a layer lookup\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-3446) - OFBIZ-3446", 
   "This patch does not fix an issue with calendar in layered lookups. So I will create a new Jira for that.",
