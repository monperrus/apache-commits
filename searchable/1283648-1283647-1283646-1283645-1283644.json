   "Fix for 2 gumbo_priority bugs. One was a miscalculation of a Parallel effect's duration when it had zero-duration child effects, causing a problem when seeking into that parallel effect. The other was a fix to the easing model for transform effects. Now a transform effect will handle easing through its internal keyframes, preserving the behavior specified by the caller (or by the default easing behavior).", 
   "QE Notes: None. Behavior for AnimateTransform should be as before, although the way easing is applied to the subclasses has changed (and is now correct)",
