   "JDBCUserDatabase gets basic support for inserting an \"initial role\" row into a admin-defined roles table. This is designed to enable JSPWiki to serve as an enrollment mechanism for container-managed users, in those cases where the container and JSPWiki share user information. A future set of commits will include adjustments to WikiPermission, UserManager and UserPreferences to support this functionality. We do *not* envison broader role management capabilities for JDBCUserDatabase, other than just this initial role row insert support."
