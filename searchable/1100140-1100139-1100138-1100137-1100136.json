   "A patch from Willem Janssen \"Balancesheet dynamic labels & dutch translation accounting labels\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4248", 
   "Currently the labels that indicate the totals on the balancesheet are hardcoded in the balancesheet.groovy file. This patch makes them dynamic, re-using existing labels in accountinguilabels.xml and adding 2 new ones. A side effect is that these labels are not capitalized anymore in the balancesheet screen...", 
   "Also other dutch translations are included in this patch in the accounting ui and entity labels files.",
