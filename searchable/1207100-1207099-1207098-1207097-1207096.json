   "Fixes CAMEL-4719 so camel-web works better inside WebLogic; avoiding the use of the scalate console unless its present and in debig mode and having a precompiled error page to avoid unnecessary runtime compilation of scalate templates. Also used the simpler scalate filter which adds support for jade, markdown, confluence etc easier with less boilerplate XML in web.xml"
