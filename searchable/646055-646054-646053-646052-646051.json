   "Minor rename for MNG-3498, adjustments to two others to exempt 2.1 from being tested by them (in the case of 3221 this is in hopes of fixing the relationship between site plugin and reports, and in the case of 3485 we've been talking for awhile about moving to protocol mapping for wagons instead of including them in the core). Finally, adjusting 3473 to be a little more bullet-proof WRT the use of the ${plugin.version} expression and report-plugin versioning."
