   "Where a target cannot be resolved in the BaseWireBuilderImpl clone an sca binding to represent the unresolved target. This sca binding can then do whatever resolution processing is required at a later stage. I also took this opportunity to tidy up the sca binding and remove much of the old target resolution code. I also fixed the tests that relied on it. TUSCANY-2269 also went in, thanks Ram for the patch."
