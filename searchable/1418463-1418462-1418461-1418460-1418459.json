   "Fix doc and other.locales targets for release build.  There were several issues.  textLayout could not build doc because there wasn't a valid textLayout_rb.swc to update since the textLayout.properties files were in spark.swc. (TLF has hard-coded English messages and a hook for apps to use for localized messages so Flex put the localized messages in spark.swc).  Fixed a couple of path issues.  There were a couple of ordering issues because of unneeded swcs being including in the *-config.xml files.  Now build a textLayout rsl along with the rest of them."
