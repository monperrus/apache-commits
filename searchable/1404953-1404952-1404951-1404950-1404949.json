   "STANBOL-792: Changes to the existing NER engine in preparation for the implementation of this issue", 
   "* Engine does now support ConfigurationPolicy.OPTIONAL. because of that the default configuration for it in the enhancer.defaults module is no longer required", 
   "* The Engine does now correctly report itself as dc:creator (previouse the NEREngineCore class was reported). Because of that regex statements used by integration tests needed to be updated. This change will allow to distinquish enhancement comming from the NamedEntityExtractionEngine with those to be implemented for STANBOL-792", 
   "* Created a new NerEngineConfig class that already allows to configure specific NER modles for languages AND also supports the configuration of custom \"NER type -> RDF type\" mappings", 
   "* Extended the NEREngineCore to support specific NER models AND NER type -> RDF type mappings.", 
   "So what is missing for STANBOL-792 is the implementation of the Engine for custom models and unit tests for those features."
