   "Reworked Windows scripts. These scripts are only used by the modularized Windows_mod.pm code.  Added ASF headers.  Removed Windows root password from script files.  The Perl code now searches for and replaces the WINDOWS_ROOT_PASSWORD string in the files when it copies them to a node.  Renamed vcl_* files to make the names more generic."
