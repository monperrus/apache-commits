   "Fixed logic error setting the transformation matrix for block-container viewports (applies to absolute and fixed block-containers only). The CTM now only rotates and shifts the content as necessary for reference-orientation and writing-mode. All the rest of the transformation is done by the renderer which allows to add additional transformations as made possible by fox:transform (see below).", 
   "Important: External renderer implementations need to adjust for the change and implement the new method concatenateTransformationMatrix(AffineTransform) if the renderer is derived from AbstractPathOrientedRenderer.", 
   "New extension attribute fox:transform on fo:block-container allows free-form transformation (rotation, scaling etc.) of absolute and fixed block-containers. Supported only for PDF, PS and Java2D-based renderers.", 
   "Added missing region background painting for PCL renderer."
