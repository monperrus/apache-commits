   "Eliminated the isSetPrefixBeforeStartElement hack. This was introduced to work around a StAX conformance issue in early versions of IBM's XLXP parser, but it causes unnecessary overhead that penalizes parsers that conform to the StAX specifications. Since the StAX conformance issue in XLXP is now handled properly in the StAX dialect implementation, the hack can be eliminated.", 
   "Regression tested with Axis2 trunk."
