   "As requested by ASF Infra, changed all the direct links to Confluence; they now link to the automatically generated HTML export; the top search form is still pointing to Confluence; also there are several exported pages that look ugly, we will have to address these, but for now it should be enough to be compliant with ASF rules."

   "Added subroutines to Module.pm: create_mn_os_object, mn_os, set_mn_os.  Added code to State.pm::initialize to create a management node OS object.  This allows for an OS object to be created representing the management node's OS, allowing the Linux code to be used to perform operations on the management node.  This should reduce duplicated code.  Other modules created can access the management node OS object via $self->mn_os.",

   "Added utils.pm::get_file_size_info_string which accepts a byte integer argument and returns a formatted string displaying the file size in bytes, MB, and GB.", 
   "Fixed bug in utils.pm::string_to_ascii if the string argument is 0.  It had been returning an empty string instead of 0.", 
   "Fixed bug in Windows.pm::reg_query.  It was adding extra spaces to key names."
