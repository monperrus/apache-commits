   "No longer using modules for NMaven.Core and pom model: could not get the module type (even with dll wrapper) to work in VS and SD IDEs. This required compiling all projects as dlls and adding some additional methods to installing dependent dlls into an executable directory in the local maven repo. This solution only works local: still need a resolver for this. Otherwise, this the first fully functional version fo the IDE to pom converter."
