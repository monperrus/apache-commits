   "Accessibility changes to Panel and TitleWindow, as requested by Freedom Scientific.", 
   "These components now report their accessibility role as \"grouping\" rather than \"window\". Their accessibility name is now simply their title. They no longer report any child items. Their accessibility location is the bounding rect of the entire Panel or TitleWindow.", 
   "The AccessibilityImplementation continues to be attached to the titleBar, not to the Panel/TitleWindow, because the Flash Player ignores Sprites with an AccessibilityImplementation that are inside other Sprites with an AccessibilityImplementation. (The Flash accessibility model is flat, not hierarchical, and \"child IDs\" are only used for things like list items, not for controls in titled container.)", 
   "So although in the display hierarchy the Panel is a parent of its content controls, in the MSAA model it appears as their preceding sibling. JAWS will look at the \"grouping\" role and understand that because the bounding rect of the grouping includes some of its following siblings, they are \"inside\". (I don't know what this means in terms of what JAWS will actually speak.)", 
   "Also, the AccImpl class now implements getChildIDArray() to return an empty array, so that by default all components have 0 child items (rather than reporting an error).", 
   "Finally, subclasses with child items now compute how many they have and then call a new AccImpl utility method, createChildIDArray(), to create an Array that looks like [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ].",
