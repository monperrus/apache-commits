   "Build 228", 
   "* Fix for 2783360, \"Inlines are positioned incorrectly in vertical text when using the factory\". There is a positioning adjustment applied to", 
   "TextLines and floats in the factory, to transform them since they assume the right hand edge (the top of the text) is at 0. This positioning", 
   "adjustment was incorrectly being applied to inlines, which are children of the TextLine, and the net effect was that the inlines were appearing", 
   "offset to the right by the size of the container.", 
   "Build 225", 
   "* Fix 2775253, \"Error returns when copying and pasting a text flow with Floats repeatedly.\" This turned out to be a number of separate problems.", 
   "First, the error should have been an assert. Second, if the float was not loaded the first time through composition, and we had to remove it", 
   "from the line and retry, and if there was a following float that had already loaded, then it was throwing. Third, when it got to the redraw phase,", 
   "it was sometimes trying to add the float to the container at an illegal z-order position (past the last child location). Fourth, if the float", 
   "appeared within the range of visible text, but was not itself visible, and it was after a partial compose, then all floats disappeared", 
   "(were removed from the display list). Fifth, sometimes during composition the backout was failing if the line was the first line in the container,", 
   "and we were composing from the start.", 
   "Build 223", 
   "* Fix 2774250, \"If a skew &  rotate matrix is applied to the container, the cursor scales.\"", 
   "Build 220", 
   "* Fix 2759026, \"Remove Deprecated method EditManager/IEditManager.delayedOperations\". The latest version of Flex Hero no longer calls the old API,", 
   "so it can be removed. If you have any problems, please pick up the latest Flex SDK.",
