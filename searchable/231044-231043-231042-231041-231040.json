   "Bugfix: Introduced a new member variable in LayoutContext holding the alignment in BP direction. Now that we have mixed inline/block capabilities the alignment must always be properly set depending on the direction we fetch the element lists for. Holding the BP alignment in the LayoutContext makes sure this information doesn't get lost when directions are mixed."

   "Bugfix: Block.handleWhitespace() causes whitespace to be scanned multiple times without the new NullCharIterator that is now returned by Block. This simply makes sure that the recursive character iterator cannot iterate into text from other blocks. The effect was that some text was swallowed when blocks were nested in inlines."
