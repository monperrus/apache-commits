   "As Joshua points out, the ad may not be for apachecon all the time and it's just an ad. So I've removed the content in the iframes and gone with nothing - this seems to look best in text browsers and hopefully would work well in accessbility cases. The only guy I'm aware of with such a setup uses lynx with screen-scraping->voice. He's going to see 'IFRAME' regardless of whatever we do."
