   "[HBASE-7366] Make old logs directory have a subdirectory structure", 
   "Author: amirshim", 
   "Summary:", 
   "To speed up replication, it is useful to have each regionserver's old logs in a separate directory, so we don't have to do LS on a 300,000 file directory (namenode doesn't like that).  So we're changing the oldlogs directory structure to contain subdirectories of the format: \"10.159.11.45%3A60020\", for example:", 
   "/TITAN029-ASH3-HBASE/.oldlogs/10.159.11.45%3A60020/10.159.11.45%3A60020.1355452542203", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "Unit tests - passed.", 
   "Run on cluster, and make sure that files are being moved to the correct subdirectories, and being deleted after the retention time has elapsed.",
