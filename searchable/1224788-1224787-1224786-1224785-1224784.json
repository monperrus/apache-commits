   "QPID-3713: remove redundant failover test cases", 
   "The following tests/test cases have been identified:", 
   "1) QueueBrowserAutoAckTest#testFailover*. These tests were running against Java 0-9-1 profiles and excluded against Java/CPP 0-10. New test cases FailoverBehaviourTest#testTransactedQueueBrowserCloseWhileFailover/testClientAcknowledge test the same code paths.", 
   "2) AcknowledgeAfterFailoverOnMessageTest/AcknowledgeAfterFailoverTest. These tests were globally excluded (Excludes file). New tests FBT.testClientAcknowledgedSessionCloseAfterFailover/testTransactedSessionCloseAfterFailover/testAcknowledgeAfterFailoverForAsynchronousConsumer cover these scenarios.", 
   "3) MessageDisappearWithIOExceptionTest. Tests were added after a defect arising from Java Broker use of MINA. Test scenario covered by FBT.testRecoverAfterFailoverInAutoAcknowledgeMode.", 
   "4) FailoverBeforeConsumingRecoverTest. Test case seemed weak: merely caused a failover then repeated the same tests as its super (RecoverTest). FBT.testRecoverAfterFailover and testRecoverWithConsumedMessagesAfterFailover are superior replacements.", 
   "5) QuickAcking. Test exercised same code paths as FBT.testMessageProducingAndRollbackAfterFailover.", 
   "CloseAfterConnectionFailureTest duplicates FailoverMethodTest#testNoFailover. The testcase was actually excluded from all profiles."
