   "Fixed a compatibility bug that was preventing JSPWiki from starting in an older version of Resin [ JSPWIKI-92]. This issue surfaced three bugs: web.xml's <description> and <display-name> elements were in the wrong order; an unneeded SAX parser feature was being set in WebContainerAuthorizer; and (most egregiously) TabTag overrode a superclass method, setId(), when it should not have. TabTag's implementation has been \"pulled up\" to WikiTagBase, and it now delegates properly to the superclass. In addition, as a bonus,  all \"id\" attributes for custom JSPWiki tags are now immunized from cross-site scripting injection."
