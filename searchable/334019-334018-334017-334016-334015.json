   "Add new PredicatedNodeTest base class for both the LocPathIterator", 
   "and the AxesWalker.  This helps break up AxesWalker a bit, and", 
   "allows optimized location path iterators to have predicates.", 
   "Adapted optimized iterators to this new scheme.", 
   "Also fixed bad bit test for creating childWalkerMultiStep, which", 
   "may have been the source of the performance degragation reported.", 
   "Also set the waiting list in LocPathIterator to null by default.", 
   "Also made it so that, for AxesWalker#cloneDeep, don't pass a", 
   "vector in (and don't create one in the first place) if the waiting", 
   "list is null.  Also fixed childWalkerMultiStep so that it can be built", 
   "for as long as the steps are down pointing and one level traversing."
