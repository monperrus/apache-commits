   "Upgraded Priha to 0.5.5. Fixed several unit tests that broke as a result. Note that Priha is now *extremely* sensitive to incomplete shutdowns of JCR, particularly in unit tests. Unit tests *must* be very sure to call WikiEngine.shutdown() every time a WikiEngine is started up. Also, removed XML schema (not needed any more)."
