   "few small fixes in the ongoing process to finish oauth/signed fetching:", 
   "- Reworked SigningFetcher to use parse_url() instead of Zend_Uri, the later was crashing on some (misformatted) url", 
   "- Added original query params back to signRequest(), they shouldn't be skipped :)", 
   "- Added a OAuth container/synd key hack (to be fixed properly soon) so the code path is at least testable", 
   "- Reworked JsFeatureLoader and removed the recursion from loadFiles(), it was picking up on mvn generated files and thus loading things twice if you also mvn'd", 
   "- Added CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option to BasicRemoteContentFetcher, not all gadget cert's are verifiable"
