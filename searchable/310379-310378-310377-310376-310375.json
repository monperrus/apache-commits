   "Implemented expression-based find support", 
   "- main menu and docked/undocked panels now share the same find text field (as a tab is selected, the find textfield in the main toolbar is replaced with the active tab's find textfield) - ensures find expressions matched active panel", 
   "- modified filter text check thread - now avoids updating the filter if the text hasn't changed", 
   "NOTES:", 
   "- press ctrl-space or right mouse to activate the find textfield's context menu (expression help)", 
   "- expression errors are reported in tool tip", 
   "- find is -relative- to the selected row (press ctrl-home to search from the top)", 
   "- 'scroll to bottom' is bypassed if there is ANY text in the find field", 
   "- typing in the find field doesn't automatically perform the find - press F3 or the find button (reverse find will be added later)", 
   "- to re-activate 'scroll to bottom', clear the find field", 
   "- find history (similar to pressing enter in 'refine focus' combo box to store expression) will be added later", 
   "- will add an ANY keyword to replace the previous find capability - search across all fields"
