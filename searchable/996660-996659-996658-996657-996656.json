   "New simple Geo Management in Webtools. It still misses a Geo Assoc Find Screen.", 
   "For the moment in trunk the Link Geos screen use a standard multiple dropdown. It's not easy to use (see why at http://www.ryancramer.com/journal/entries/select_multiple). In the jQuery branch I have used the asmselect plugin, much easier for end users. Actually I'm not totally satisfied by it either. It's a beta and seems to be freezed. Also the way the field is shown is not flexible enough. It's a fixed size area and I tried to work around. I could be done better though. I will have a look. Sascha thought we could use jQuery.ui.sortable but I don't think it exactly corresponds to the feature needed.",
