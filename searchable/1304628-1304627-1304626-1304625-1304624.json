   "[jira] [HBASE-5469] Add baseline compression efficiency to DataBlockEncodingTool", 
   "Summary:", 
   "DataBlockEncodingTool currently does not provide baseline compression", 
   "efficiency, e.g. Hadoop compression codec applied to unencoded data. E.g. if", 
   "we are using LZO to compress blocks, we would like to have the following", 
   "columns in the report (possibly as percentages of raw data size).", 
   "Baseline K+V in blockcache | Baseline K + V on disk (LZO compressed) | K + V", 
   "DataBlockEncoded in block cache | K + V DataBlockEncoded + LZOCompressed (on", 
   "disk)", 
   "Background: we never store compressed blocks in cache, but we always store", 
   "encoded data blocks in cache if data block encoding is enabled for the column", 
   "family.", 
   "This patch also has multiple bugfixes and improvements to DataBlockEncodingTool,", 
   "including presentation format, memory requirements (reduced 3x) and fixing the", 
   "handling of compression.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "* Run unit tests.", 
   "* Run DataBlockEncodingTool on a variety of real-world HFiles.",
