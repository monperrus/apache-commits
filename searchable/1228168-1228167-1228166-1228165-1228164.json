   "LUCENE-3305: Refactor dependencies between classes. DoubleArrayTrie is now a simple utility class like e.g. a HashMap, but once built it's read-only. It can be written to any OutputStream and read from any InputStream. As the trie is part of the TokenInfoDictionary, I moved the singleton instance used for that here. The file is now also named like the TokenInfoDictionary where it belongs. Using this refactoring, one *could* also provide a trie for a UserDictionary (needs changes in Viterbi)."
