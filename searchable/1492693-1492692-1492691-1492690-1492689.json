   "Updated reserved.pm so that the parent reservation waits for all child reservations' reserved processes to terminate before changing the request state to inuse. This fixes a problem where the state would change before the child's reserved process ended. The child's inuse process would fail to launch because vcld detected the other process still running.", 
   "Moved user connection check loop from OS.pm::is_user_connected to inuse.pm. Updated inuse.pm to update reservation.lastcheck for all reservations in a cluster when a user connection is detected. While looping waiting for a connection, the current reservation.lastcheck is retrieved from the database. If it changed it means some other reservation in the cluster detected a connection and the loop terminates.", 
   "Reworked and simplified much of inuse.pm::process. It was still using goto calls."
