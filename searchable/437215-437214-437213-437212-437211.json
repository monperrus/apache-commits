   "DERBY-119: Add ALTER TABLE option to change column from NULL to NOT NULL", 
   "This change merges the db2AlterColumn and columnAlterClause routines in", 
   "the parser to provide a single ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN statement that", 
   "provides support for changing the NULL / NOT NULL constraint on a", 
   "column in a table.", 
   "I believe that the existing execution code in AlterTableConstantAction", 
   "is correct, and so this patch primarily involves parser changes to hook", 
   "up the compiler to the existing execution code.", 
   "The patch also modifies the constraint handling in ModifyColumnNode so", 
   "that a column cannot be changed to NULL-able if it is part of either a", 
   "primary key or a unique constraint. Prior to the patch, ModifyColumnNode", 
   "only checked for a PRIMARY KEY constraint, so this patch also adds a check", 
   "for a UNIQUE constraint. It also rewords the error message to describe the", 
   "new conditions which can cause the ALTER COLUMN to be rejected."
