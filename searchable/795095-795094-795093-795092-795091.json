   "Fixed bug that occurred during image capture if Sysprep is disabled. It wasn't configuring the image to automatically log in root and run post_load.cmd. Added prepare_post_load() subroutine to Windows.pm which does this. Added code to Version_5.pm to call prepare_post_load() if Sysprep is disabled, otherwise run_sysprep() is called. Removed pre_capture() subroutines from XP.pm and 2003.pm. This is now implemented by Version_5.pm since the code was the same for XP and 2003. Also moved defrag step to before the parent pre_capture() sub implemented by Windows.pm is called. This causes the hard drive to be defragmented before the pagefile is disabled. This causes the defrag to take less time.", 
   "Also fixed bug in Windows.pm::filesystem_entry_exists(). It was replacing forward or backslashes in the path to be checked with a single backslash. This needs to be a double backslash or else it's seen as an escape character."
