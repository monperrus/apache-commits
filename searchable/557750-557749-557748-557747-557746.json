   "One of the mildly annoying bits about the XPath implementation is that the selectSingleNode", 
   "selectNodes methods will return Axiom objects when an xpath uses the comment(),", 
   "processing-instruction(), text(), and @attr queries.  While these are not likely to be used", 
   "extensively, this change hides the Axiom objects behind an Abdera facade.", 
   "e.g.", 
   "instead of", 
   "OMText text = (OMText)xpath.selectSingleNode(\"//a:title/text()\",entry);", 
   "we can do...", 
   "TextValue tv = (TextValue)xpath.selectSingleNode(\"//a:title/text()\",entry);", 
   "The one downside to this is that for it to work, Axiom requires us to change the value", 
   "of the default OMFactory implementation, which could be problematic when using Abdera with", 
   "other Axiom based software.  We want to play nice with other software packages, so we won't", 
   "register the default automatically.  Instead, call FOMFactory.registerAsDefault() if/when",
