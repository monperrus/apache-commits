   "Jetty initializer that starts Jetty before Cactus tests are run. This is really nice to quickly run tests inside any IDE or even from a simple <junit> Ant taks without the need to package a WAR. In addition, it is real nice to debug tests this way. Moreover, Jetty starts in less than 1 second, making it completely seamless and transparent! We are now at the same order of magnitude as pure JUnit tests in term of speed ... :-). Of course, this is only for Servlet tests ..."
