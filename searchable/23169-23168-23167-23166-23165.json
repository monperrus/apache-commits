   "bug 3586: on BSD-related platforms, the default perl may be 'picky' about when it allows setuid().  Mac OS X doesn't allow setuid() at all (documentation added to spamd/README).  FreeBSD (and presumably the other *BSD variants) don't allow setuid() unless euid == 0, so we work around this by trying a simple setuid() and if it fails, change euid, then ruid, then euid again.  spamd, for instance, sets euid for processing messages, which shows this issue."
