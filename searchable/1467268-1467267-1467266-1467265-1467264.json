   "Moved UnmodifiableArrayList out of public because this class contains a significant hole in type safety.", 
   "The getElementType() method return the value of Class.getComponentType(). But because Java arrays are covariant",

   "declared as Class<E>. This is safe only if the caller know that he invoked UnmodifiableArrayList.wrap(E[]) with", 
   "an array whose component type is exactly E, not a subtype of E. We can try to be careful about that in SIS code,", 
   "but we can not rely every users to be aware of this hole. So we are better to keep this class hidden.", 
   "Also removed many CollectionsExt method from public API. The fact that their contract is tedious to explain", 
   "is an indication that those methods should not be public. Furthermore they may change in any future SIS version."
