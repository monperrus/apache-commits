   "Here's a patch to allow for the setting of the Host attribute on the MX4J", 
   "HttpAdaptor.  This adds an optional 'manager-adapter-host' attribute that", 
   "can be configured in the MX4JSystemManager section of kernel.xml.", 
   "The reason for this patch is that the HttpAdaptor only binds to localhost by", 
   "default, thus leaving it inaccessible to remote machines.  The default", 
   "behaviour of this patch is to still bind to localhost, as before, but one", 
   "can now optionally specify a host alias for a public interface.",
