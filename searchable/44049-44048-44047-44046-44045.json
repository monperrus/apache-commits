   "While doing some profilng today we found out that doing new HashMap() is expensive relative to doing a simple proxy invocation.  Stopped doing 3 new HashMap() in SimpleInvoation by unifying all the maps into a single map and then we lazy create the map as needed.  All keys to the Invocaiton map now have to implement the InvoationKey interface which lets the marshalling layer know if the key and data should be marshalled or not."
