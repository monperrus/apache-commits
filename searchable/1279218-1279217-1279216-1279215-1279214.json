   "The three cases needing handling in Group.commitProperties() handling of a blendMode change are: the case where blendMode is auto, the case that blendMode is set to a native Flash blendMode, the case that blendMode is set to a non-native AIM blendMode (which is handled via a blendShader). There was lingering code for a fourth case that was setting blendMode back to normal in the 4th case - meaning when changing a blendMode to an AIM-based blendMode, it didn't take. Now, that errant code is gone.",
