   "Switch over to new endpoint reference/endpoint model. These are the changes required to exploit the model in the runtime up to the point were the old EndpointReference is retrieved from a wire. The next step is to convert this over too and exploit the new endpoint references fully. There is still tidying to do (search for TODO - EPR) in particular I haven't removed any of the old files yet. So beware don't put changes into CompositeActivator or RuntimeWire as the runtime isn't using them"
