   "JIRA issue JS2-659: Compliance with http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html", 
   "- bump version to 2.1.1-RC", 
   "- bump bridges dependencies to 1.0.2-RC (AFAIK now also in compliance with http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html)", 
   "AFAIK, this commit brings Jetspeed-2 fully inline with the requirements of http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html,", 
   "so I'll close J2-659 hereafter.", 
   "I'll also tag this \"release candidate\" 2.1.1-RC, but (as the -RC already indicates) this will not lead to a new release (yet).", 
   "There are still *zero* code changes since the 2.1 release (well, except a minor fix for a testcase misbehavior).", 
   "If a real 2.1.1 release is deemed required because of important bugs, we can always create a separate 2.1.1-dev branch based on the 2.1.1-RC tag.", 
   "But the main larger development will continue on the trunk for which I will bump the version to 2.2-dev shortly."
