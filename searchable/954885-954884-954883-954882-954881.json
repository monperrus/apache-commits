   "added a helper method to make it easy to build up camel routes generically with reflection from inside Scala code. The current ProcessorDefinition type declaration, being recursive, seems to cause some issues when trying to use the typesafe APIs in Scala on a ProcessorDefintion to add a new step. One day we maybe should introduce a super type below ProcessorDefintion which is a simple non-recursive generic type so it can be easily used from both java and scala without hitting our heads on generics pain & only using these complex recursive generic types for the return values of typesafe DSL methods."
