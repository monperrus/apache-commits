   "Added animation behavior to scrollbars and sliders. For now, animation only happens based on mouse events (key events still have previous non-animated behavior).", 
   "Also, added shift-click behavior to ScrollBar, behaves essentially like a Slider, going to the clicked location instead of paging toward it.", 
   "Finally, fixed an unrelated bug in Animation where Animates set up with a MotionPath with no time=0 keyframe would not run properly.", 
   "These changes necessitate changes in Mustella (need to listen to 'change' event on scrollbars/sliders, not 'updateComplete' or 'click', since the animations may cause several valid 'updateComplete' events on the way to the final changed value.", 
   "QE Notes: Mustella changes in ScrollBar and Slider necessary. See note above. Changes have been made and are awaiting this checkin to update Mustella tests.",
