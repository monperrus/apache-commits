   "Removed obsolete code from reclaim.pm which was no longer being called because the Linux modules now implement a sanitize() subroutine.  Moved call to sanitize() out of reclaim.pm::process and into a new sub called call_os_sanitize() so that the code can be reused.", 
   "Moved get_currentimage_txt_contents() and get_current_image_name() out of Windows.pm and into OS.pm so that they can be used by the Linux OS modules. Created get_current_image_name() sub in UnixLab.pm that overrides the one in OS.pm. Lab machines don't contain a currentimage.txt file and the image name should be correct for lab reservations, so it just returns the reservation image name.", 
   "Renamed the initialize() sub in Lab.pm to load(). It will get called at the same time when a reservation is processed."
