   "1- Some client-side classes need to be registered with Flash player; this normally is handled by generated AS code when an MXML is compiled to SWF, but when MXML is not involved, one needs to register these classes manually.", 
   "2- LoaderConfig.url is not available outside Flex and this was causing \"url is null\" error in Channel url token replacement code.", 
   "There isn't much we can do for #1, classes still need to be registered with Flash player so strong types are used instead of generic Objects on the client/server. For #2, I added a URLUtil.hasTokens(url:String) method that takes in a url and returns true if the url contains server.name/server.port tokens. Then, I changed Channel url token replacement code to use this new method. This resolves the \"url is null\" error.",

   "Modified the Channel.applySettings() ASDoc comment. Removed the XML snippet for the method parameter, which wasn't relevant to the primary way this method is used. This method is primarily used in our channel subclasses to add settings specific to those channels and then call super to get the base channel settings. If a developer creates a custom channel class, the developer could use it in the same way, but would be setting the applySettings() method on the custom channel class with properties specific to the custom channel implementation.
