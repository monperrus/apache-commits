   "* Added handling of exceptions to the HttpClient#execute methods that take a ResponseHandler as a parameter", 
   "* Modified AbstractVerifier to use log instead of printStackTrace()", 
   "* Modified BasicResponseHandler to always throw an exception when status >= 300, even if entity == null", 
   "* Fixed concurrency problem in ConnectionPoolByRoute. Before this change, the RouteSpecificPool could be removed between the time that the waiting thread was notified and it actually woke up. The code was modified to not remove the thread from the RSP until it wakes up, so pool.isUnused() returns false when a thread is actually still waiting.", 
   "* Reordered date patterns in DateUtils. Someone claimed this enhanced performance.", 
   "* Small Javadoc fix in NetscapeDraftSpec", 
   "* Modified RFC2109Spec#formatCookies() to not modify the passed in list (it could be unmodifiable)",
