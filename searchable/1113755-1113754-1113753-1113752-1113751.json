   "Eliminated the dynamic typing used in GraphNode to choose between meanings of the \"aliases\" slot: null if unattached singleton, a GraphNode if a member of the cohort represented by that node, and a Set<GraphNode> if leader of that cohort of nodes. Instead introduced a new type with subtypes that make the necessary distinctions. All done in the service of getting rid of generic casting. Was it worth it? Only time will tell."
