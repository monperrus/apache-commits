   "Additional speedup to the Attachment processing.  This patch introduces the BAAInputStream and BAAOutputStream utility classes.  These classes are like the ByteArray*Stream classes except that they use an array of 4K byte[] to store the data.  The use of non-contiguous byte[] to store the attachment data will reduce the copying/resizing/gc overhead."
