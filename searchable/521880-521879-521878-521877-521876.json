   "Added style/node mapping mechanism for the nodes in the widget controlled by the bridge.  This puts class application on a much firmer and extensible basis, and also simplifies the code for LabelBridge and any future bridges which will need to style more than one node.", 
   "Take the case of a Label:  we'll need to style the root dom node with style xapLabel, and the \"Contents\" node with the style xapLabelContents.", 
   "The map is an object that looks like:", 
   "map = { \"\":<the root dom node> , \"Contents\":<the contents node> }  ,", 
   "so that the style  concat(\"xapButton\",label) is used on map[label].", 
   "The map is also used with all explicit classes set with the \"class\" attribute, as well as the one implicit to each tag.", 
   "Also:  altered setClassAttribute() s.t. old classes are removed completely, save for the implicit root dom node class (e.g. \"xapLabel\") before the new explicit ones are applied."
