   "Refactoring parts of the code. In order for custom managers (such as the clustering managers) to take advantage of the background threads that are already implemented, it is better to have the Manager interface to expose the backgroundProcess method.

   "I opted for this way instead of using reflection. Yell if you don't like it, and I will change it back."
