   "Added a new/highly refactored version of the STOMP protocol implementation.", 
   "The biggest difference between this and previous implementation is that conversion between the STOMP protocol and", 
   "the ActiveMQ protocol happens at a Transport Filter layer instead of doing it all at the WireFormat layer.", 
   "I think this has resulted in cleaner code since there's a better seperating between marshalling/unmarshalling of", 
   "the STOMP protocol and converting the stomp protocol to the activemq protocol."
