   "CAMEL-1417: Fixed performance issue with StreamInterceptor causing too many convertions attempts that is bound to fail. Improved logic in MessageSupport to also avoid type convertions if not possible. In the rude performance test we get a 2x gain on my laptop. And the Camel715 can now again be run with 50000 loops in about 5 sec, giving a 10x gain."
