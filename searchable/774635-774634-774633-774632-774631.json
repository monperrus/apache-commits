   "refactored \"markEventRead\" service to allow updating when status is COM_COMPLETE (the default after a messge is sent), also stopped 'admin' users from marking other user's events as read (do a manual status change instead), implemented a little event which marks a communication event as read, and returns a 1px gif image (spacer.gif) to the browser/mail client; include the following in your communication email:", 
   "<img src=\"http://localhost:8080/partymgr/control/ceimages/${communicationEventId}/logo.gif\"/>",
