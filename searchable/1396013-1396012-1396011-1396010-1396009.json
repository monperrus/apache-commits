   "Three new profiles have been defined in the POM: equinox38, equinox37, and equinox35. Each profile configures the maven-paxexam-plugin to generate a META-INF/maven/paxexam-config.args file pointing to the corresponding framework runtime environment, which is used to execute the tests. By default, the equinox38 profile is active and will be used to run the tests unless overridden. To override the default profile, simply specify the desired profile on the command line. For example, \"mvn test -P equinox37\" or \"mvn install -P equinox35\"."
