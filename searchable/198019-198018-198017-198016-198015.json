   "This is supposed to fix a problem that surfaced with Finn's latest change in PageSequence. There was an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException here in LineLayoutManager when a static region was layouted for the second page (instance is reused). It seems to me that \"iCurrParIndex\" could be made a method-local variable instead of an instance variable."
