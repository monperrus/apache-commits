   "Fixing some issues with the caret index, specifically how it relates to selectedIndex.  When the selectedIndex gets set, it would short-circuit if the value was the same as the current selected index.  However, we also rely on that setter to change the caret index for us.  So, I added some logic in there to do just that and also cleaned up some places where we were setting caret index directly when the selectedIndex setter can just handle it for us.", 
   "There are still some places where we set selectedIndex and then set caretIndex.  Those shouldn't be necessary, but I didn't see a real reason to go through the code and remove them all.",

   "Adding a \"down\" state for item renderers when in touch interaction mode.  This means item renderers don't go in to the \"selected\" state when someone presses down on them.  They first go in to the \"down\" state.  If the user later starts scrolling or moving around, the item renderer returns to the \"normal\" state.  If they press down and release up on the same item, the item renderer will go from the \"down\" state to the \"selected\" state.  This distinction is necessary on touch devices to distinguish between \"down\" and \"selected\".  There's also a new \"selectedAndDown\" state.",
