   "Made the pattern execution classes fully general, i.e. not dependent", 
   "on being the child or descendent axis (in reverse terms of match", 
   "patterns, the parent or ancestor).  The patterns use the DTM", 
   "traversers, and may be a tiny bit slower.  Also, non-absolute patterns", 
   "(i.e. not '/' or functions) have the magic \"./\" added on front, which", 
   "is needed to generilize the proximity predicates. Predicates are now", 
   "executed *after* the relative step is executed, so that proximity may", 
   "be properly counted in relation to the relative step node.",

   "is to build the complex LocationPaths, and use them with the", 
   "coming match iterator.",
