   "STR-2879: fix behavior when used with modules to be consistent with Struts 1.2.x.   Specifically, dispatch forwards for tiles within the TilesPreProcessor, rather than creating a ForwardConfig and leaving that responsibility to a later chain command (e.g. PerformForward).  Also, change chain behavior slightly; for both includes and forwards, TilesPreProcessor returns false  (i.e. 'continue processing chain'), but sets the ForwardConfig to null if TilesPreProcessor has called  requestDispatcher.(forward|include).  This would potentially allow someone to have housekeeping commands in the chain which  would be able to execute, while preventing PerformForward from believing that it needs to do anything."
