   "When normalizing a String object to upper- or lower case one needs to be very careful not to rely on the default locale of the platform. This results from the fact that Turkish in particular does not map characters to their upper- or lower case equivalents in English. Where this could pose a problem, we force case conversion to be done according to an English locale."
