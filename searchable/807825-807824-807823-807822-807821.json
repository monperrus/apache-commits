   "for reasosn that make no sense to me, forrest/cocoon seem to have been freaking out with an error of 'images/solr_FC.jpg    BROKEN: null' ever since r730648 when i added solr_FC.svg.  aparently they don't like jpg files and svg files haven't the same root name.  renaming this file (so something more seo friendly) seems to fix that problem.  NOTE: there are still other broken link problems, but those seem to be unrelated due to a bug in the theme we are using"
