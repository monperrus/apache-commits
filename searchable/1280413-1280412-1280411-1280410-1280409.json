   "1.Rename properties in FxComponent: skinObject -> skin, skinZZ -> skinClass.", 
   "2.Rename property in Skin: data -> fxComponent (this also means Skin doesn\u2019t implement IDataRenderer anymore)", 
   "3.Renames in DataGroup: Mostly around \"skin\" to \"renderer\" to get terminology correct", 
   "4.Random other cleanups: For instance changing typing of \"*\" to \"Object\" in ItemsComponent and DataGroup or removing some un-used imports in Group and GroupBase.", 
   "5.Lots of cleanup in flex4tests to deal with renaming of classes and renaming of properties", 
   "6.Gumbo-manifest.mxml  - typo...some files listed as mx.componentss.* instead of mx.components.*.  This file is going away as all components are moved into the 2009 namespace, but we'll fix this for now.", 
   "7.Defaults.css \u2013 FxDataComponent should be FxDataContainer.", 
   "8.SystemManger fix: this was in the previous SystemManager but got overwritten by a bad merge.  Jim\u2019s aware of the issue, and I\u2019m checking in the fix for it.",
