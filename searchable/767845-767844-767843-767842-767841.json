   "Some French Labels + a change Andrew suggested for CommonEmptyHeader. I commit it since it fix the problem at hand (\"&#160;\" codes floating all over the place)", 
   "But this is not as simple as the original issue is due to Labels Manager.", 
   "If you put a sole space (ie > < ) for CommonEmptyHeader, then if you do some modifications with Labels Manager in this file and then save the file you will get",

   "<value xml:lang=\"en\"/>", 
   "</property>", 
   "In order to cope with this I tried to write directly at SaveLabelsToXmlFile.saveLabelsToXmlFile[93] the String \"&#160;\" which should be ok. But I guess I would have to change the format passed to UtilXml.writeXmlDocument some lines below since else it write \"&amp;#160;\" and not \"&#160;\" as intended. Not sure it's possible though. And I have no time to look at it right now.", 
   "And we will have to deal with that in a complete way since else we will find an even worst trouble later (as soon someone will use Labels Manager to save changes in this file)"
