   "Fix to make the \"Clone Layout\" button to work again after recent security refactoring.", 
   "NB: the error was caused by the wrong way in which the link with parameters (that are now rendered as forms to post the parameters in a secure way) was implemented in the content application: it was a field of a form causing a nested <form> element in html. Unfortunately this pattern is used in other screens in the content application and sooner or later we will have to fix them in a similar way."
