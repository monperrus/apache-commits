Use weak references for storing the Ranges so that they can be garbage collected if the application no longer has any references to them. Inspired by the patch by Ludger B\u00fcnger except that I used a LinkedList instead of a WeakHashMap due its good memory management when items are removed (and also good for bulk removals through its iterator)."
