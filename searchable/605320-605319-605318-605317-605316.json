   "added jetspeed.om.Page.columnEmptyCheck(), which sets height of a column to 1px when it is empty - column height is set back to auto when not empty; this prevents sibling columns to the right from shifting left and taking the place of the empty column (previously used min-height 40px, which worked in mozilla but not IE)",
