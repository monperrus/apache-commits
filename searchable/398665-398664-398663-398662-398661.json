   "Currently for compress procedure to work incase of case-sensitive table name , schema names, they needs to be passed in quotes like ( call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP' , '\"Order\"' ,1) ;). This behaviour is not consitent with other procedures and the docs.", 
   "This patch makes compress procedure parameters for table names , schema name should be passed in the case-sensitive form if they are quoted identfiers and in upper case if they are not quoted SQL identifiers, similar to other system procedures. Compress procedure generates ALTER COMPRESS statement.with quoted table name and schema name."
