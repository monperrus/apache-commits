   "o Refactored out SAAJ creation code into seperate interceptors. They reside", 
   "in the SOAP module.", 
   "o Made SAAJ input logic more efficient by creating a document fragment", 
   "from the incoming response which includes the Envelope, Headers, and", 
   "Body element - but not the contents of the body. This then gets turned", 
   "into a SAAJMessage.", 
   "o Refactored SAAJ logic so it doesn't require doInterceptInSubChain().", 
   "An interceptor which writes the message is added to the end of the chain.", 
   "This allows a more logical phase set up of putting the LOGIC handlers", 
   "after the MARSHAL phase.", 
   "o Remove Phase definitions from cxf.xml as its confusing and unncessary to", 
   "have the phase definitions in two places."
