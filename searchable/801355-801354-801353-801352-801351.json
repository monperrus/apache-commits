   "Added Windows.pm::reg_import() subroutine and changed import_registry_file() and import_registry_string() to call this new subroutine rather than using SSH to call reg.exe IMPORT directly.", 
   "The reg_import() subroutine was configured to call reg.exe using a UNC path to the local computer rather than a normal file path. This tricks Windows into running reg.exe in 64-bit mode if a 64-bit OS is used. If reg.exe is run in 32-bit mode under a 64-bit OS, the location of the registry keys operated on may not be where you would expect. For example, if you run reg.exe in 32-bit mode to alter something under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft, it actually alters HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft.",
