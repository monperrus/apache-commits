   "Some fixes to the import/export resolution mechanism and simplifications to make it usable in the manager app without a contribution repository and contribution listeners. Added resolvers to the exports to filter resolution based on what's exported. Started to implement a minimal class model resolver for use in the manager environment and default delegating resolvers to help with the implementation of import/export resolvers. Also fixed the manager app contribution loading and resolution logic to avoid loading the same contribution multiple times."
