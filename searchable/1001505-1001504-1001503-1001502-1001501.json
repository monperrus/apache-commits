   "OODT-38 Update to build process to remove RAT unless the audit profile is active. This profile is activated on when running maven by using \"mvn -P audit\" followed by any other mvn commands you want to run. This profile is added to all modules by default and if they want to override the default behavior they should define the audit profile with their own plugin configuration for RAT. The activation of the audit profile is by default off and should continue to be specified the same when overriding this behavior in modules."
