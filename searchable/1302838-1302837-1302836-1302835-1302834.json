   "DERBY-5357 SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR shouldn't use identifier as file name", 
   "Since SQL identifiers can contain arbitrary characters, it is not safe", 
   "to use them as is as part of a file name. Trying ot map parts of the", 
   "name by excluding unsafe characters leads to a chance of name", 
   "collision. So, we have changed the naming altogether.",

   "of the jar files stored in a database. The name is now based on UUID,",

   "jar-files reside directly in the \"jar\" database directory, and the", 
   "name is of the form", 
   "<Derby uuid string>[.]jar[.]G[0-9]+",

   "The format is changed on hard upgrade, cf tests in Changes10_9.", 
   "Also, dblook has been updated to cater for this change."
