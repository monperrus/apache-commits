   "When input comes from DOMSource, a TreeWalker object walks the DOM input and", 
   "fires events to the ContentHandler for the result object, unless the DOM", 
   "consists of only an Attribute node.  In the case of an Attribute, the TreeWalker", 
   "is not utilized, and just the character data is copied to the result.", 
   "As part of the traversal of the DOM, the TreeWalker always fires startDocument", 
   "and endDocument events.  The code in the transform(Source,Result) method was", 
   "redundantly firing those same events if the Node specified by the DOMSource", 
   "was not a Document node.  Instead, that should be left to the TreeWalker.  The", 
   "startDocument and endDocument events should only be fired in the transform", 
   "method itself to complete the entirely local processing of Attribute nodes."
