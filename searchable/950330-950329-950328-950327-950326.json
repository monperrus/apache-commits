   "[UIMA-1051] For PDF, stop using Palatino (only works if build on Windows), and use Times Roman (the default for variable spacing font in PDF).  Change the interline spacing for body to look good with this font.  Comment out Font section of Docbook so it works on non Windows build platforms. Leave Palatino in as comments in case someone really wants that look for PDF."
