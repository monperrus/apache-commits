   "Cool changes to more fully support derived type usage!",

   "3) Mark all types as referenced if anyType is referenced.", 
   "Details:", 
   "1) Added Utils.getDerivedTypes method that gets the derived types of", 
   "the indicated TypeEntry type. If the indicated type is an xsd:anyType, then", 
   "all the TypeEntries in the symbol table are returned.  I also", 
   "added some code to getDerivedTypes and getNestedTypes to check the size", 
   "of the current set versus the size of the symbol table.  Obviously if the", 
   "sizes are the same, no more processing needs to be performed.", 
   "2) Changed Utils.getNestedTypes to use a TypeEntry parameters instead of a Node parameters.", 
   "Also added a derivedFlag parameter.  If this flag is set, the nested and", 
   "derived types are returned.", 
   "3) Changed setTypeReferences to consider derived types.", 
   "4) Changed Utils.getNodeTypeRefQName to handle defaulting of type attribute", 
   "on an element/attribute.", 
   "5) Changed comprehensive test to test these new features."
