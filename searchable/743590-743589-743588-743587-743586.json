   "[MNG-3971] Updating Ant-mojo support to provide the standard Maven classpath refs and plugin-style expression evaluation available in the antrun plugin. This depends on the newest (as-yet unreleased) maven-plugin-tools-ant to enable the new functionality, though it is still backward compatible. Ant-based plugins build using the plugin-tools-ant versions that are older will work, but won't have access to maven.compile.classpath, etc."
