   "Create a WSIFProvider model for all provider implementer to use", 
   "The idea for this is to make it simple(r) to write a WSIF provider. I'd like models to exist for the WSIFProvider, WSIFPort and WSIFOperation. These models would use design patterns such as template methods, factory methods, and abstarct factories, to 'force' provider writers to do things the 'correct' way, and to allow WSIF to do most of the WSDL oriented stuff for them, allowing the provider to concentrate on just whats required to implement accessing a particualer service type.", 
   "Feel free to chip in with your own ideas or to suggest moving this to proposals etc. The WSIFProvider model is the easiest which is why i started with that. Unless I hear someone complain I'm going to start moving the existing WSIF providers to use this."
