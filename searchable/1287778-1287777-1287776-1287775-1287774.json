   "VideoPlayer fixes, including focus fixes and some other fixes.", 
   "For Focus:", 
   "SkinnableComponent:", 
   "- Now check the drawFocusAnyway flag before checking for focusManager.getFocus() != this because in the case of the video player volume bar, we don\u2019t actually have a focusManager", 
   "TrackBase:", 
   "- Override of focusIn/OutHandler wasn\u2019t calling super.focusIn/OutHandler().", 
   "Slider:", 
   "- Now instead of overriding setFocus() and calling stage.focus = thumb, we just override drawFocus() and tell the thumb to drawFocus().  This means we keep the focus ourselves and handle the keyDown events on ourself rather than on the thumb.", 
   "FocusSkin:", 
   "- Change the exit-early logic so that we don\u2019t exit if we have no focusManager...we only exit if we don\u2019t have a focusObject (and we sometimes rely on the focusManager for this focusObject).  FocusObject actually gets slammed in via SkinnableComponent, so this should be fine.", 
   "VideoPlayerVolumeBar:", 
   "- On focus in, open the drop down, validate it, and draw the focus on thumb.", 
   "VideoPlayer:", 
   "- set tabChildren = true so we can tab into the components", 
   "Skins (VideoPlayerSkin.mxml only):", 
   "- Change the layer of focused components with: focusIn=\"event.target.layer=1\" focusOut=\"event.target.layer=0\"", 
   "Other Changes:", 
   "TrackBase:", 
   "- Add official CHANGING event.  Work still needs to be done on dispatching it in all cases correctly.", 
   "- Remove the check for (!enabled) in the thumb_mouseDownHandler...this shouldn\u2019t be needed thanks to Jason\u2019s change.  We do this in Scroller as well, and I\u2019ve got a local change for that which will come later as part of the Change/Changing ARB issue fix.", 
   "PopUpAnchor:", 
   "- Needs to take into account the fullScreenRect to get the popup to display correctly in those cases.", 
   "FlexEvent:", 
   "- Adding CHANGING event.", 
   "VideoPlayerScrubBar:", 
   "- Changed bufferedValue to an Array to handle a Range.", 
   "VideoPlayerVolumeBar/VideoPlayerVolumeBarEvent:", 
   "- \u201crollOverOpenDelay\u201c: Change the \u201cbehavior property\u201d to a style per the ARB decision.  I intentionally left it as a private static const before to make this change easier.", 
   "- Advertise a new event, mutedChange to go along with a new property muted, rather than rely on mutedButtonClick.", 
   "VideoPlayer:", 
   "- Add symbolColor metadata (this was already working...just no metadata for it).  Do I add color here?", 
   "- Add fullScreenHideControlDelay as part of ARB behavioral property decision", 
   "- Changes around volume bar and muted property and muteButtonChanged event.", 
   "- Fiex the full screen case...need to make sure to use globalToLocal() and localToGlobal() when positioning the object since fulLScreenRect is in global coordinates.  Also need to call LayoutManager.getInstance().validateNow() rather than just validateNow() because I need everythignt o be validated since not including the compoennt in a layout may change the coordinates of the parent component.", 
   "- In scrubBar_changeHandler, if scrubbing to the end of a video, don\u2019t do it when streaming and you\u2019ve called play() because the source is a String...there\u2019s a bug in the FLVPlayback that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll get fixed :-)", 
   "- Fixed a few other bugs..nothing too big", 
   "Defaults.css:", 
   "Set the behavioral properties in here", 
   "Skins:", 
   "- Set the height explicitly on the ThumbSkin..this is the exact pattern we use for Hslider/Vslider now", 
   "- Fix up the baseColor so it gets cleared in the full screen case", 
   "- Fix up the text styles so we are explicitly setting them in the fullScreen case.  They can now be styled via CSS in the non-fullScreen case and the color style should work.",
