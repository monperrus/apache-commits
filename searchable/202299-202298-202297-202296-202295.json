   "Derby-394: Improve formatting and presentation of the documentation.", 
   "1. Added more related links. DITA can dynamically create related links separated", 
   "by conceptual info, task info, and reference material to the bottom of each", 
   "page of each book. This means that not only does it place a link to the", 
   "parent topic of each file, but it also adds sibling links and children links.", 
   "When I originally created the DITA files for these books, I didn't account", 
   "for this.", 
   "2. Implemented use of the <shortdesc> tag. If we separate the first few", 
   "sentences of each topic from the rest of the content by placing them in a", 
   "<shortdesc>, the result is that if the parent topic or any siblings have a", 
   "link to that topic generated by DITA, then the content in the shortdesc tag", 
   "is also pulled and used as a summary of the topic.", 
   "3. Improved badly-formed tables.", 
   "4. For the Server and Admin guide, editorial changes such as fixing grammar,", 
   "spelling, and punctuation, removal of italics and bold type where it wasn't", 
   "needed, and removal of empty topics.", 
   "Committed for Jeff Levitt <derby@mylevita.com>"
