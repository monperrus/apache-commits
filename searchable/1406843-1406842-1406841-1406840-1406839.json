   "Change the build.xml to set step_timeout to 1 if running mobile tests on a desktop emulator. Not sure yet why this is necessary since non-mobile tests do not specify this, but at least step_timeout does not have to be explicitly specified and can be changed if needed."

   "Simplify the way we interact with FileUtils/RakeFileUtils/Rake::DSL to try and avoid reliance on the order in which the dependencies are loaded. Unfortunately there was several problems in different platforms based seemingly on order of files returned from Dir in rubygems library. This attempts to side-step the issue completely"

   "Modifications made to support testing on mobile platform, mainly for use through the desktop emulator. Added a new property to ConditionalValue, targetOS, to allow tests to be run on the emulator OS yet target a mobile OS such as 'android' or 'ios'. There will probably be refinement of this process, but allows the desktop emulator to generate images for a specific mobile OS at different ppi values."
