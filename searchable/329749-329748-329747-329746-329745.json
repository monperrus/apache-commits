   "Added the SandeshsaGlobal handler. This is used to put logic that could be carried out globally (to apply for all services). Because of the current way Axis2 have been implemented, had to make sandesha a global module. The service specific handlers will check a property in the services.xml to detect weather RM is anabled for the service.", 
   "Added following loging to the global handler.", 
   "1. Eliminating duplicate messages.", 
   "2. Setting relatesTo value of ack messages to null (some framesowors (e.g. indigo) tend to send a relatesTo value for the ack which could cause an invalid dispatch).", 
   "3. Sending ack messages for duplicate messages if required.", 
   "did some corrections in the Storage classes."
