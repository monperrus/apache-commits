   "[UIMA-857] Adding a new startup Jar tool (whose use is completely optional) that will add Jars it finds in a passed-in string containing directories and jars, to the classpath.  This startup Jar will enable (but not require) simplification of many of our startup scripts.  It does not change any other code, and old methods will work as before."
