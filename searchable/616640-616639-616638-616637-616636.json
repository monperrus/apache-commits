   "Added the ability to call simple methods from screen widgets. This eliminates the need to define a service to call a simple method.", 
   "Just use the <script location=\"component://... .xml#methodName\" syntax. The simple method call works just like a service event - the result Map elements are copied into the screen context.", 
   "Note that this enhancement should NOT be used to circumvent existing services - since many processes depend upon SECAs, which won't get executed using this screen widget operation."
