   "JS2-1064: Jetspeed Maven Plugin errors with Maven 2.1.x or Maven 2.2.x", 
   "Adjusting build configuration for Maven 2.2.x (and probably Maven 2.1.x) changed plugin dependencies inheritance (not!).", 
   "The \"default\" jetspeed-maven-unpack-plugin dependency is no longer \"seen\" from a parent pom :(", 
   "However, once a child pom does \"load\" such a dependency, *sibling* poms suddenly start \"seeing\" it again...", 
   "Sigh, seems like a maven bug which we somehow have to workaround.", 
   "Solved for now by defining the needed \"default\" jetspeed-portal-resources dependency in each plugin usage.", 
   "Additionally, while in there I also improved the <skip/> property configuration by replacing its value from ${maven.test.skip} to {skipTests}", 
   "Finally, I also source formatted (again) some of the poms, but no changes other than described above were made."
