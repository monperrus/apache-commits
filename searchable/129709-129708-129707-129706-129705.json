   "Note: until we move to Commons HttpClient or find a solution to the broken HttpURLConnection class, the tests for the following servers will block (the tests will still run fine but each test for which the response is empty will have to time out so it will take a long time) : Tomcat 4.x, Resin 1.2, Resin 1.3. There is still a problem with Orion 1.5 and support of forward()"
