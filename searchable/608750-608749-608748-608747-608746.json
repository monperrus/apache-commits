   "[SM-1128] verify we can support cxf ws-* based on camel cxf transport. camel cxf transport just use cxf transport api and can use camel supporting protocol as underlying protocol, for example we can use jetty which is supported by camel, instead of http transport from cxf. So far test for ws-security and ws-policy is done, test for ws-addressing and ws-rm is still in progress, seems we need complete back channel of camel cxf transport in apache camel project.",
