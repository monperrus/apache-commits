   "Changed the header support a bit. Because any behavior attached to a component may implement IHeaderContributor, each Component has to iterate over its attached behaviors if the header section is about to be rendered => I moved the respetive code from WebComponent and WebMarkupContainer to Component => It is no longer required that a component implements IHeaderContributor. The extension required for Panel and Border to get the wicket:head tag from the associate markup file has been renamed to renderHeadFromAssociatedMarkupFile() and is still with WebMarkupContainer. It must be explicitly called by Panels, Borders or any other component with this requirement which subclass renderHead().",
