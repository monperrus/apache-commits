   "Don't expose internal transaction properties like 'svn:check-locks' through", 
   "the public FS API and error out on attempts to change them.", 
   "When creating a transaction, a caller can specify one or multiple flags like", 
   "SVN_FS_TXN_CHECK_LOCKS.  These flags affect how the transaction behaves", 
   "when being prepared or committed.  For example, a caller can tell us that", 
   "she/he doesn't want the back end to perform on-the-fly lock checking or might", 
   "want to specify the final 'svn:date' value for the transaction.  We want to", 
   "persist these flags even if a transaction is reopened \u2014 that's why we map", 
   "them into a set of internal transaction properties, set these properties when", 
   "a transaction is created, and drop them just before the commit.", 
   "Prior to this changeset these internal properties were a part of what our", 
   "FS API returns, and we also allowed changing them (while being particularly", 
   "picky about 'svn:client-date', as any attempts to change it were silently", 
   "discarded).  Instead of that, now we filter out *all* internal transaction", 
   "properties in functions like svn_fs_txn_prop() or svn_fs_txn_proplist(), and", 
   "we also forbid changing them with svn_fs_change_txn_prop() / _txn_props().", 
   "We don't need this ourselves, and we no longer allow arbitrary FS API", 
   "callers to mess with our private implementation details.  Furthermore, this", 
   "makes the property setters do what they were told to do or fail.  This is a", 
   "better choice compared to silently stripping out 'svn:client-date' changes", 
   "and saying that everything went fine.  As a caller, I'd expect a successful", 
   "call to mean that the requested changes were applied without any problems,",
