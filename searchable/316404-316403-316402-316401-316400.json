   "1) Removed namespace binding code from the document scanner. Because", 
   "of the nature of DTD validation vs. Schema validation *and* the", 
   "way that default attribute values can affect the way that namespace", 
   "binding works, the validator is now responsible for performing the", 
   "namespace binding operation.", 
   "For DTD validation, namespace binding should occur *after* the", 
   "validation step so that default attributes can be added. However,", 
   "for Schema validation, namespace binding should occur *before*", 
   "the validation step.", 
   "2) Created a namespace binder component that performs namespace", 
   "binding. That way we can remove the validation stage in the", 
   "pipeline completely and still retain namespace support through", 
   "the use of the XMLNamespaceBinder component.", 
   "3) Wrote a simple NamespaceSupport class that performs the basic", 
   "operations of the SAX2 helper class of the same name. This", 
   "version compares prefixes and URIs as symbols and uses a lot", 
   "less memory than the SAX2 counterpart."
