   "removed lots of serialization in ODE", 
   "the only classes/interfaces for which serialization is really important in this package are the step interpolators. The reason for that is that the ContinuousOutputModel is explicitly serializable and contains step interpolators. This allows users to perform integration of any complex model and to save the result of the integration for all integration range by serializing a ContinuousOutputModel instance. This feature is a major one."
