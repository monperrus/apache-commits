   "[HBASE-7266] Using pread for non-compaction read request", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary:", 
   "There are 2 kinds of read operation in HBase: pread and seek+read.", 
   "Pread, positional read, is stateless and create a new connection between the DFSClient and DataNode for each operation. While seek+read is to seek to a specific postion and prefetch blocks from data nodes. The benefit of seek+read is that it will cache the prefetch result but the downside is it is stateful and needs to synchronized.", 
   "So far, both compaction and scan are using seek+read, which caused some resource contention. So using the pread for the scan request can avoid the resource contention. In addition, the region server is able to do the prefetch for the scan request so that it won't be necessary to let the DFSClient to prefetch the data any more.", 
   "I will run through the scan benchmark (with no block cache) with verify the performance.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "unit tests:",
