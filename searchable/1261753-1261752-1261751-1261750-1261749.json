   "There is both a style and property called layoutDirection in UIComponent. For UIComponent, both Hans and I agree that we should promote the use of the style. I added an exclude for the layoutDirection property in UIComponent. This allows code hinting for the layoutDirection style in the CSS style declaration. It also removes the layoutDirection property from the ASDoc. Code hinting still works for the layoutDirection attribute on a UIComponent subclass MXML tag. This attribute gets set to the property, not the style.",

It is not possible to code hint for the direction style in the CSS style declaration without removing the direction property from ASDoc. We are just going to have to live with this limitation.",

   "Since the ColorPicker's SwatchPanel is parented by the SystemManager it wasn't inheriting the layoutDirection and it wasn't invalidating the layoutDirection. The fix is to pass the layoutDirection to the SwatchPanel and always call invalidateLayoutDirection in PopUpManager.addPopUp.",
