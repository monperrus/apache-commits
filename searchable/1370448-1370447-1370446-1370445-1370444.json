   "DERBY-5839 (dblook run on toursdb fails on triggers with java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in dblook.log)", 
   "We document that SYSTRIGGERS.REFERENCEDCOLUMNS is not part of the public API and hence that allows Derby to change underneath the behavior of the column. Prior to 10.9, this column only had information about columns referenced by UPDATE trigger. But, with 10.9, we use this column to also hold information about the trigger columns being used inside trigger action plan. This enables Derby to read only necessary columns from trigger table. But because of this change, it is not enough in dblook to check if SYSTRIGGERS.REFERENCEDCOLUMNS.wasNull. We need to also check if the string representation of that column is \"NULL\". Making this change fixes DERBY-5839"
