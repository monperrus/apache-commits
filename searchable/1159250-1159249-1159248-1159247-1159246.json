   "QPID-3429: ensure that SSL is enabled correctly in MinaNetworkHandler. Refactor SSLContextFactory to be a factory, and present a useful interface for both client and server side use. Added keystore for the Java broker, renamed existing client trust/key stores for clarity. Fix SSL port configuration. Added new SSL tests, and ensure these are *always* run in the Java 0-10 profiles.",
