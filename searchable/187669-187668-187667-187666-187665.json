   "the language code is a mess", 
   "im not really sure how to address this easily, since its tied to the Pluto model", 
   "The  problem I had to deal with is caused by the language set creation is tied to the <portlet-info>", 
   "If no portlet-info exists, then no languages are added to the language set", 
   "This is wrong, as the spec states you can have either portlet-info OR resources bundles", 
   "In the case where there was no portlet-info, yet there was a resource bundle, a NPE", 
   "would occur trying to access a non-existent resource bundle", 
   "This patch attempts to rectify the situation on the fly", 
   "I think a better approach would be to create the language set based on the supported locales"
