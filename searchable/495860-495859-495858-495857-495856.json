   "POJOfied the cocoon-store-impl module. Needed to copy and adapt the MRUMemoryStore from Excalibur store to be able to POJOfy the DefaultStore and DefaultTransientStore. While adapting the MRUMemoryStore I commented away the instrumentation support as I don't know how it works. Should we support instrumentation and in that case should the Excalibur version be used?"
