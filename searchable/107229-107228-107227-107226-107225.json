Made various modifications to support 1) removing user manager (adding <userRepository> setting, 2) moving classes to mailrepository and userrepository package. 3) reorganized LDAP configuration to the configurable repository, as well as database settings. 4) added anti-spam meassures so blocks some basic spam and makes it out of the box you cannot relay email."
