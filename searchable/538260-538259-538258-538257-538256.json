   "DERBY-2631: Expose existing auto-generated key functionality through more JDBC", 
   "APIs in embedded mode.", 
   "1. Updates the following JDBC methods so that they no longer throw a \"Feature", 
   "not implemented\" error in embedded mode. Instead they make calls to an", 
   "already existing internal method and pass in the appropriate arguments:", 
   "Connection.prepareStatement(String sql, String[] columnNames);", 
   "Connection.prepareStatement(String sql, int[] columnIndexes);", 
   "Statement.execute(String sql, String[] columNames);", 
   "Statement.execute(String sql, int[] columIndexes);", 
   "Statement.executeUpdate(String sql, String[] columnNames);", 
   "Statement.executeUpdate(String sql, int[] columnIndexes);", 
   "2. Changes the (already existing but not currently used) code in", 
   "sql/execute/InsertResultSet that handles autogen column indexes/names", 
   "to throw an error for any target column that is not an auto-increment", 
   "column. This is because Derby's implementation of getGeneratedKeys()", 
   "internally maps to the IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL() function, which only returns", 
   "keys for identity (autoincrement) columns. So if the user specifies", 
   "something else, we'll throw an error.", 
   "3. Changes the names of two existing (but unused) errors to more accurately", 
   "reflect their intended use (they are now called by the changes for #2).", 
   "Also changes the text for those errors as the old text seemed a tad", 
   "awkward. No regression impact here because the two errors in question", 
   "were never exposed to users before now.", 
   "4. Makes a slight change to jdbcapi/statementJdbc30.java (a test) to", 
   "reflect the new behavior (we no longer throw \"Feature not implemented\"", 
   "errors).", 
   "5. Adds test cases for the newly supported APIs to the JUnit test", 
   "lang/AutoGenJDBC30Test.java. This involved adding two more utility", 
   "methods to junit/BaseJDBCTestCase.java, as well."
