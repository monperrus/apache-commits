   "Dispose ImageReader when done reading.", 
   "Don't close streams as some codecs appear to do \"late reading\" of the image, i.e. only when the rasters are accessed, at which point they still seek on the stream. For this, the streams must remain open. I hope the codecs all properly close the streams once they don't need them anymore. The javadocs are not clear enough in this regards, IMO."
