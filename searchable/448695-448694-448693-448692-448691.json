   "In a review comment for a different issue someone mentioned that instead of creating new Integer() objects it'd be better to use the Derby ReuseFactory where possible to avoid excessive object creation. I get the feeling that's not a big deal with the _v1 patch for this issue, but I nonetheless thought it'd be a good idea to follow that advice with the changes.", 
   "So I'm attaching a tiny patch, d1776_reuseInt.patch, that replaces the calls to \"new Integer()\" in the _v1 patch (which has already been committed) with calls to ReuseFactory.getInteger(). Functionally, the patch doesn't change anything."
