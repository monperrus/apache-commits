   "DERBY-1304: DROP VIEW does not always completely remove view", 
   "This patch was contributed by Yip Ng (yipng168@gmail.com)", 
   "The problem is that DROP VIEW's binding logic is using its superclass", 
   "QueryTreeNode's bind() method which just simply returns the object itself.", 
   "So there is no actual binding done in DROP VIEW at all! It should have", 
   "created a dependency on the statement, so when its associated descriptor", 
   "gets dropped, the statement can be invalidated accordingly. This explains", 
   "why the second DROP VIEW fails since it is not invalidated by the system."
