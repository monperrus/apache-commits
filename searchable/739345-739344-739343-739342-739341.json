   "Added a sanity check to utils.pm::kill_reservation_process so it would never attempt to kill a process if the process ID failed to match a pattern of all digits. Updated utils.pm::reservation_being_processed to check if both a computerloadlog 'begin' entry exists and to check if a process is running. The process running part was and still is commented out because it needs more testing. Added utils.pm::run_command. This is similar to run_ssh_command but will run commands locally on the management node."
