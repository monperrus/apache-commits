   "1. Consolidated the specification (Javadoc) of OMElement#addAttribute(OMAttribute) by defining a consistent set of requirements covering all possible cases and by accurately describing the side effect of addAttribute on namespace declarations. The specification is consistent with the current LLOM behavior, with two exceptions:", 
   "* If addAttribute replaces an existing attribute, it should obviously set the owner of the replaced attribute to null.", 
   "* If the attribute passed as argument is already owned by the element, addAttribute should be a no-op.", 
   "2. Added a set of test cases checking compliance with these requirements.", 
   "3. Fixed the addAttribute methods in OMElement (LLOM) and ElementImpl (DOOM) to conform to the requirements.", 
   "4. Fixed some other issues in DOOM that were preventing addAttribute from working properly."
