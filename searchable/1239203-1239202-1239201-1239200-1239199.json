   "For issue #2487, \"mod_dav_svn and locales fail to play nicely together\",", 
   "add a new configuration option which allows Subversion libraries called", 
   "from mod_dav_svn to process UTF-8 strings, instead of just ASCII strings.", 
   "Because httpd is not locale-aware, we cannot assume that a native character", 
   "set other than ASCII is present in the environment that mod_dav_svn runs in.", 
   "UTF-8 is backward compatible to ASCII, and all paths within Subversion", 
   "repositories are already encoded in UTF-8. Thus, we can safely allow UTF-8", 
   "without running into character set conversion issues in code called from", 
   "mod_dav_svn.", 
   "Basic testing shows that httpd is prepared to tolerate non-ASCII characters,", 
   "even though it doesn't seem to interpret them. E.g. it logs such characters", 
   "as hex codes preceded by a backslash.", 
   "The new configuration option is called SVNUseUTF8 and can be set to", 
   "\"On\" or \"Off\" (the default is \"Off\"). It is a global option that takes", 
   "effect for all repository locations defined in the configuration file.", 
   "When the option is \"On\", files that contain UTF-8 characters in their", 
   "names can be processed by the pre-lock hook, hooks are able to write",

   "repositories may contain UTF-8 characters.",
