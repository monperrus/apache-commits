   "2) Fixed the wrong usages of operation in the JDKWireService (in some cases, we use the source operation for the target side)", 
   "3) Replaced \"interface.java\" with \"interface.wsdl\" and fixed some issues in the wsdl file. It's the same workaround as we did on the client side that we have to force the axis2 service to use WSDL interface so that data transformation is triggered."
