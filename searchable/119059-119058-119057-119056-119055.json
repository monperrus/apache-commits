   "Patch to fix the bootstrap process so that it actually works on a windows machine which has cygwin installed.", 
   "I'm not sure if the bootstrap ever worked with cygwin installed; I couldn't get it to work. For a start sh.exe isn't aways installed as part of cygwin so this mechanism does seem a little brittle.", 
   "Also why bother using cygwin and sh just to invoke maven when maven.bat works perfectly well on windows?", 
   "So it might be worth just descoping the cygwin mechanism on Windows as it makes the code veyr confusing.", 
   "However for now I've just patched the code so that by default cygwin is not used even if it is installed.", 
   "If you want to use cygwin on windows, then define the 'maven.use.cygwin' property in your build.properties in your home directory and the bootstrap should behave as before."
