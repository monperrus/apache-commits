   "Added a pe_id to the iterator variable being stored in Temp, this way two different database portlets on the same page or in seperate panes should work. Also added the pe_id to the request query for all actions and in the case of sorting, hence all the variables retrieved from rundata.getParameters() are now unique. This will help maintain state between two database browser portlets on the same page.", 
   "Added tableSize parameter to context to figure ou whether refresh button should be displayed or not. Also now the actions handles the case of a null query by bypassing getRows().", 
   "Added new method for getting parameters and a fallback routine for getting them. These should eventually be moved into a Utility or helper class."
