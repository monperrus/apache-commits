   "-------------------------", 
   "1) Rewrote SiteModel and PlanetModel to completely eliminate the need for", 
   "use of offset/length paging logic in macro code.", 
   "1a) For all collections suitable for paging I added pagers: WeblogsPager,", 
   "UsersPager, CommentsPager and PlanetEntriesPager.", 
   "1b) For collections suitable for display in a sidebar, I only allow the caller", 
   "to specify the max number of objects returned.", 
   "ISSUE: We don't want callers to use these to fetch giant collections, so", 
   "perhaps length should be throttled at 100 or some configurable value.", 
   "1c) $siteModel and $planetModel are now known as $site and $page.", 
   "1d) Updated site.vm to use new pagers.", 
   "ISSUE: Still need to fix URL formulation in site.vm", 
   "-------------------------", 
   "2) Updated the Atlas theme to use the new SiteModel and PlanetModel pagers.", 
   "ISSUE: Still need to pare Atlas down to the bare essentials and move it out", 
   "of the themes directory, or perhaps make it available onto to frontpage", 
   "and/or aggregated weblogs.", 
   "ISSUE: The frontpage macros still use $pageModel beacuse they need access", 
   "to request parameters for letter, user and weblog.", 
   "ISSUE: I had to add a hack to the PageServlet to allow the use of the", 
   "\"letter\" request parameter, which is bad but we need to figure out some", 
   "way to allow theme pages to use arbitrary request parameters.", 
   "-------------------------", 
   "3) Added new webpage.navbar field to indicate if a page should be shown in the", 
   "weblog's standard navbar. This replaces the old \"_\" prefix.", 
   "3a) Added navbar field to database migration script. The script also sets all", 
   "pages with names that start with \"_\" to navbar=falase.", 
   "3b) Template files still use \"_\" to indicate \"hidden-from-navbar\". Files that", 
   "use this convention still get special treatment, they're marked as navbar=false", 
   "and since the \"_\" prefix is unsuitable for use in URLs, it is stripped off in", 
   "the template link field.", 
   "3c) The page menu macro now uses the navbar field instead of \"_\" to hide pages."
