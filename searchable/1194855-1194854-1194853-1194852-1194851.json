   "XSD 1.1 assertions require the root node of assert XDM tree to be untyped (this was tested in couple of XSD 1.1 test suite tests), and all other nodes of assert tree need to be typed. The typed value of the assert root node needs to be also annotated with the type untypedAtomic.", 
   "We were earlier non compliant for this feature, and this commit provides this enhancement.", 
   "These changes also required few improvements to PsychoPath XPath engine, whose updated jar is also provided with this commit. The corresponding PsychoPath XPath engine code base at Eclipse CVS was also updated.", 
   "There are also few minor javadoc improvements in this commit."
