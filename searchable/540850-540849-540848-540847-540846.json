   "1.) Fixed a bug under IE when there are no rows (a layout method references firstRow.childNodes", 
   "without gating against there not being a first row).", 
   "2.) Fixed overflow from rightmost header under IE by a.) making the formerly invisible", 
   "splitter pane to its right visible, and b.) styling it like a header.  The overflow", 
   "never showed before the splitterpane was put in front of it; something's messed up in IE (6&7)", 
   "that seems to make {clipped text} + {invisible pane --> {visible text}.", 
   "3.) Seem to be close to fixing scrollbar stuff; setHeight() is altered so that:", 
   "a.) under Mozilloid browsers, we don't attempt to set the height until", 
   "the domNode, scrollDiv, and table all have non-zero heights and widths (seems", 
   "not to bother row-less tables, but we'll see).", 
   "b.) we reset the scrollDiv over flow to \"scroll\", size it, then switch it", 
   "back to \"auto\" with a 500ms delay so that it will have time to know", 
   "that it's being overflowed (I think).", 
   "The \"Seem\" and \"close\" to in 3.) sup. are there because I doubt this is everything; still", 
   "it looks a lot better than it was earlier tod--- yesterday."
