   "bug 3109: priority-tracing -- automatically enforce priority ordering for meta rules, so that metas always run after their dependencies.  Remove the now-superfluous META_TEST_MIN_PRIORITY hack.  also, change the values of the MISSING_REQUIRED_VALUE and INVALID_VALUE constants in Conf parsing to avoid collisions with the priority range; this is safe as long as no plugins use their raw values, instead of the variable itself, which would be very stupid."
