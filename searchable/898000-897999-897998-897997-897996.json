   "This is a big update with various changes -  didn't mean to do it this way it just sort of happened.   This change contains the first pass of the JDump code with the TCK execution  (and hence changes on the VM API side)   I have also applied changes to the API so that system properties and env vars are made available as Maps rather than Properties.", 
   "The JDump TCK tests are failing as expected at this point.   Need to do  more in populating the JDump with available data.   This change also introduces a dependency on  XStream which is used to do the serialisation and deserialisation of the JDump to XML."
