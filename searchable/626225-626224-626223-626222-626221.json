   "Fixed AuthorizationManager failure to add attachment when jspwiki.security=off. [BugAddAttachmentFailsWithContainerAuthentication]. AuthorizationManager, when it initializes, supplies the default JSPWiki encoding to the updated freshcookies PolicyReader class. Many thanks to Harry Metske for identifying the need for this, based on his experiences using JSPWiki on a platform where EBCDIC is the default. (Which is probably a mainframe; yegads.)"
