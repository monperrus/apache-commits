   "SLING-3073 : removing 'mvn install' also initially, as this is no longer needed: the bundle deployment now works based on the assumption that bundle:bundle is properly supported by m2e/tycho. If that's the case, then MANIFEST.MF gets properly generated. And a 'mvn install' is not needed. Other bundles should not have any dependency on snapshot builds being installed locally (anymore). Also, doing a package.build(clean) during the wizard-install, to make sure there is a proper state."
