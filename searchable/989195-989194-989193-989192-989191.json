   "Added command to release DHCP before shutting down. I have seen a case where a DHCP address was obtained, then the address was statically set to another address.  The original DHCP address lease was cached in the image.  When the captured image was loaded and requested a DHCP address, it requested its specific address it had obtained via DHCP resulting in a DHCP NAK response.  It never obtained a private IP address and the load failed."
