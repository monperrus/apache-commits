   "Small changes to logic about Product and ProductStore requirementMethodEnumId fields for the PRODRQM_ATP setting; this should maybe be more centralized logic than split in a service for each value, but on the other hand being split out means more flexibility so it's probably good; these address Scott's comments on the mailing list to make the logic more readable, and also to handle the case where a Product may have a setting that overrides the ProductStore setting, which is not what it was doing before"
