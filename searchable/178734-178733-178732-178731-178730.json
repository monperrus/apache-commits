   "o Added inherited field to the Plugin and Goal classes in maven.mdo", 
   "o Added annotation inheritedByDefault (looks like: @inheritedByDefault true|false) for java mojos", 
   "o Added support for inheritedByDefault to MojoDescriptor, descriptor generator and builder", 
   "o Factored the plugin combinatorial logic into ModelUtils in o.a.m.project, for later reuse in a plugin-aware model inheritance builder", 
   "o Refactored the DefaultModelDefaultsInjector to use the new ModelUtils for plugin merging (this is factored into a utility for reuse in inheritance assembly)"
