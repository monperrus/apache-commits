   "Fixed two issues in StAXOMBuilder#processNamespaceData:", 
   "* The code didn't take into account that the result of OMElement#findNamespace(String, String) is undefined if both arguments are non null. The right approach is to search by prefix and than compare the namespace URIs (because a prefix can be bound to at most one namespace URI, but a namespace URI can be bound to multiple prefixes).", 
   "* When comparing prefixes, the code didn't take into account that XMLStreamReader#getPrefix() returns null if there is no prefix, while Axiom uses an empty string in this case. This caused the code to add a namespace declaration to every element without prefix, event if a corresponding namespace declaration is already in scope."
