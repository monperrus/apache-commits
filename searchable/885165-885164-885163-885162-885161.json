   "Implemented REST API for Services (categories) as defined at http://incubator.apache.org/wookie/wookie-rest-api.html plus included PUT, POST and DELETE methods requiring \"widgetadmin\" privileges. As part of this implementation I also generalized the REST controller into a new base class (Controller) with standardised exceptions for typical REST exceptions and their HTTP codes, and refactored the WidgetsController to make use of it. A set of JUnit tests has also been included for the new API."
