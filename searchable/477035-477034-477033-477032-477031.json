   "This patch is an attempt to catch exceptions raised in JSF phases allowing the shale view controller to handle them (SHALE-336).  The key extension point is subclassing the UIViewRoot and overriding the methods invoked by the lifecycle.  The overrides catch unchecked exceptions and queue them up to be processed by a global error page.", 
   "I've extended the shale-test-view to demonstrate the added exception traps."
