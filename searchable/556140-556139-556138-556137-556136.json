   "Contributor: Rich Scheuerle", 
   "JAX-WS exposes properties to access the inbound and outbound attachments.  The attachments are exposed as a Map<String, DataHandler>.  Axis2 (and the Axis2 JAX-WS implementation) stores attachments on an Axiom AttachmentMap object.", 
   "This commit adds a new class, AttachmentAdapter, that is a bridge between the JAX-WS exposed property and the underlying AttachmentMap.", 
   "This commit adds a new class, TransportPropertiesAdapter, which serves a similar function (bridges the JAXWS spec property with the underlying implementation data structure).", 
   "This commit updates the JAX-WS handler testcase to test the new adapter classes.  This commit also includes some additional minor changes and logging to the JAX-WS attachments code."
