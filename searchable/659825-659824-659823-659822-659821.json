   "Patch for adding lead/contact from left bar screen in sfa. This gives the option to create lead/contact by entering minimal fields like firstName, lastName and emailAddress. As the implementation done is same for lead and contact, it can be improved in two ways. (1) Either to move the code to a method which can be called inline in createLead, createContact services (2) By modifying generic method createPersonRoleAndContactMechs so that Address can be bypassed with a flag (Since quick add lead / contact form does not have address fields). I will work on the improvement in next few days. This patch (quickAdd.patch) is applied from Jira issue OFBIZ-1642(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-1642). Thanks Jyotsna Rathore for this patch, special thanks to Mridul Pathak for review and help."
