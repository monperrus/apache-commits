   "Added support for processing complex content in ADB.", 
   "1. Changed the SchemaCompiler.java and BeanWriterMetaInfoHolder.java classes to process (and retain) information on the extensions", 
   "2. Changed the ADBBeanTemplate.xsl to wrap the parse method around a class. the reason is that the static parse method conflicts when extended. (this also sheds light why XMLBeans use this approach)", 
   "3. Modified the test cases and the databinding templates to match the change."
