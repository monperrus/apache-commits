The component sets labelIDisplay's width and height because we want typicalItem to take priority over the an explicit width and height set in the skin. The default skin sets an explicit width on the labelDisplay in order to prevent the DropDownList from changing size when the selectedItem changes. If typicalItem is set back to null, then the component restores the original width/height of the labelDisplay.",

   "SDK-23635 - Implement type-ahead in DropDownList", 
   "Added code in DropDownListBase keyDownHandler to listen for letters and change the selection if there is a match. At some point, we should modify findKey and findString (I'll file an ECR for that). For now, I've just overridden findKey and cobbled together the logic from List.findKey and List.findString. In ComboBox, we override findKey to do nothing since ComboBox has its own logic that relies on textInput changes.", 
   "SDK-23859 - DropDownList does not reset caretIndex when selection is cleared", 
   "Fixed this in two places. In ComboBox.keyDownHandlerHelper, we update the caret index when ESC is pressed. In DropDownListBase.dropDownController_closeHandler, we update the caret index if the commit has been canceled (ie. ESC was pressed).", 
   "SDK-24175 - ComboBox does not select an item with ENTER when openOnInput = false", 
   "When the ComboBox was closed and the arrow keys were pressed, the selectedIndex was changed. When ENTER was pressed, it was committing actualProposedSelectedIndex, not selectedIndex. The fix is to override the selectedIndex setter to keep actualProposedSelectedIndex in sync if selectedIndex was changed. Usually it is kept in sync when the dropDown is opened.", 
   "SDK-24174 - ComboBox does not scroll correctly when openOnInput = false", 
   "When typing in a match, the caretIndex was changed, but not the selectedIndex (because matching when it is closed doesn't commit the value until you press ENTER or lose focus). When closed, the navigation keys were changing the selectedIndex relative to the previous selectedIndex. I updated this to change relative to caretIndex instead. In most cases, caretIndex and selectedIndex are equivalent while the dropDown is closed.", 
   "Other changes:", 
   "- Replaced some calls to dropDownController.isOpen with isDropDownOpen.", 
   "- Added protection RTE protection to ComboBox.changeHighlightedSelection",
