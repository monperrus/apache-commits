   "Corrected exception handling for TxPolicy.  Incorrectly threw a TransactionRollbackException based on the value of isNewTransaction() regardless if there was a transaction in progress or not.", 
   "The actual required logic is to only throw a TransactionRolledbackException when executing in a caller's (aka client's) transaction.  Fixed the policies and added a new isClientTransaction method so the logic is more straight forward."
