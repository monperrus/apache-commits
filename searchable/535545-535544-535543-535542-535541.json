   "Refactor context creation as per recent email thread, part 1.  The goal is twofold.  First to simplify the code and avoid an unneeded class, and second to do a better job of ensuring that the necessary layers in the context hierarchy are correctly configured.  This is \"part 1\" because there's still some work to do both here and on the Description side to really make this clean - but this gets us a lot of the way.", 
   "* Get rid of ContextFactory.", 
   "* Now the preferred way to generate contexts is to use the parent context.  So you can create ConfigurationContexts from scratch, then use configContexts to make serviceGroupContexts, etc.", 
   "* Implement ContextListener, and the ability to register listeners on ConfigurationContext.  Multiple listeners may be registered, and each one will get a notification whenever any sub-context is created.  Add tests for this."
