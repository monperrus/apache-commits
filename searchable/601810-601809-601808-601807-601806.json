   "Changes:",

   "M cpp/src/qpid/broker/ExchangeRegistry.cpp", 
   "ExchangeRegistry was modified to pass a parent pointer to created",

   "link management objects in a hierarchy of ownership.", 
   "M cpp/src/qpid/broker/Exchange.h", 
   "M cpp/src/qpid/broker/Exchange.cpp", 
   "Exchange now inherits Manageable to make it visible via the", 
   "management interface. The Exchange parent class handles most of", 
   "the management boilerplate. A Binding struct was introduced to", 
   "track bindings for management. This is separate from", 
   "QueueBindings which track bindings for queues.",

   "Broker now explicitly enables the management agent. Also sets the", 
   "management parent (vhost) in the exchange registry.", 
   "M cpp/src/qpid/broker/Vhost.cpp", 
   "Updated constructor to be more defensive in case the management", 
   "agent has not been enabled.",
