   "Implementing data types support for the property mediator. With this improvement property medaitor takes an optional attribute called 'type' which can be used to specify a type for the property values being set. As of now following types are supported:",

   "In addition the property mediator can now be used to set XML properties to the message context. We can specify a child XML element for the property mediator and that will be set as a property value. Results obtained thru evaluating expressions during mediation time can also be converted into one of above types (including OM). I have also included four new test cases to cover the new functionality. All the existing test cases are passed without any code changes.",
