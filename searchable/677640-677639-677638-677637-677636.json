   "Add a non-config starter for tomcat. All you need is the classpath including tomcat and the servlets - no config file.", 
   "There is a requirement for a temp directory - the spec requires that webapps are provided with one I believe.", 
   "It is possible to remove this or do it lazily or have some default in /tmp, if anyone wants to.", 
   "Also adding a context requires some base dir ( can be an empty one ) - so the default servlets points to something.", 
   "This can also be eliminated by setting a different default servlet - needs to be done if wanted.", 
   "It is also pretty fast - the unit tests show startup + first request in ~1 sec."
