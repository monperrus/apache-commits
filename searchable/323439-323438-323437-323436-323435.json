   "One step closer to a pluggable connection pool implementation -- now the implementation class is specified as a property.  The property value is currently hardcoded in PoolConfigGui, but that class should be the only one that needs to change in order to support other pool implementations.",

   "However, now the time for getting a new connection (when max usage has been reached) is inside the sample time.  Might have to consider moving it back out.",
