Have introduced a new NakedObjectsSystemSimple superclass which doesn't deal with sharedObjectPersistor, and then left the (unchanged) sharedObjectPersistor functionality in the NakedObjectSystem.  Theoretically this shouldn't change the behaviour, but allows us to use NakedObjectsSystemSimple if we need to."
