   "As well as fixing a problem with identity constraint handling in the grammar, this moves local element traversal in to XSDHandler.  It should also take care of the case where a local element declaration contains a type which itself contains a local element declaration.  Finally, I have implemented a class which subclasses NamespaceSupport in an attempt to find an efficient way for keeping track of local namespaces; this should be useful not only in deferred local element traversal but also in keyref handling."
