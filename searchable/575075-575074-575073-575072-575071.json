   "Currently, implementation classes which do not specify an endpoint interface (i.e.  @WebService.endpointInterface=...) cause too many method to be published.  In this case, currently all public methods from all superclasses up to, but not including, java.lang.Object are published.  This is incorrect; only methods from superclasses which carry an  @WebService annotation should be published."
