   "Modified xCAT.pm::does_image_exist. It had been returning undefined if the tmpl file exists but the image files do not, causing new.pm to fail the reservation unnecessarily.",

   "Added _create_template and _delete_template subroutines. Changed all locations in xCAT.pm to use _create_template where it had previously been copying the tmpl file inline for consistancy.", 
   "Added argument to not display output in ls SSH call in xCAT.pm::retrieve_image..  This command lists remote image library contents. It was adding a lot of useless lines to the log file.", 
   "Improved some other comments and log file messages."
