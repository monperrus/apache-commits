   "Bug fix: DefaultGroup and DefaultGroupManager now store their WikiEventListeners in WeakHashMaps to prevent listener objects (such as WikiSession) from being reclaimed by GC. Bug fix: Fixed listener bug DefaultGroupManager that was preventing WikiSessions from receiving updated GroupPrincipals when groups were changed to include new members in certain cases."

   "As part of the memory-leak fix, WebContainerAuthorizer no longer relies on a sneaky call to WikiSession.getLastContext().getHttpRequest() to test whether a user possesses a particular container role. Instead, we (only) inspect the user's Subject's Principal set for the desired role. This means that changes to container's user/role mappings are NOT reflected until the next time the user logs in."

   "WikiSession received minor refactorings to remove the set/getLastContext() methods. These were used for only one purpose anyhow (WebContainerAuthorizer) and the net result was that their inclusion was preventing garbage collection of expired WikiSessions. WikiSession also receives a removeWikiSession() method, which removes wiki sessions from its internal cache, and is called during logout."
