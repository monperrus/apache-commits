   "Modified the core tags so that the common tags expect an expression for their attributes. Tags which do not explicitly expect an expression for their attribute values can take {} around the expressions which will then be evaluated as an expression. This is kinda similar to 'Attribute Value Templates' in XSLT. It certainly makes common core tags look much simpler. Also added a sample script to output the current system properties as a HTML table to show the general idea"

   "Added support for BeanShell expressions in the core tags along with some unit tests. Unfortunately things are a bit of a kludge to support BeanShell - some changes are required to make it more optimal like (i) supporting a compile() of beanshell expressions and (ii) having to explicitly push in all variables in the context via Interpreter.set() rather than it being able to pull them from somewhere. Hopefully a neater EL could be Velocity."
