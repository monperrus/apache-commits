   "Database root directory fix. If the configuration specifies a relative location, Xindice will look for a xindice.db.home system property and use build an absolute path with it. If such property is not found, it will try to use the webapp /WEB-INF/ directory as the database root directory, issuing a warning to the user. If even that fails (because the WAR is unpacked) an Exception will be thrown and the logs will give a proper advice to the user."
