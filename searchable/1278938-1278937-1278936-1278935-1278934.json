   "-Update GridDimensions to account for changes to the defaultRowHeight through setting the typical cell height. The defaultRowHeight is now calculated as the max of the typicalCellHeights. Also, added a method \"clearTypicalCellWidthsAndHeights()\" to allow the typical item to be reset.",

   "-Fixed a bug in GridLayout so it cleans up the visible items when dataProvider == null.", 
   "-Grid now clears GridDimensions whenever columns or dataProvider is set. It also clears the typical cell widths and heights when the typical item changes.",

   "Remove the arg to the constructor for GridSelection.  Yesterday I changed it from Grid to GridContainerBase since the Grid isn't always available yet when GridSelection is created.  However this wasn't correct since you should be able to use GridSelection with a Grid without requiring a DataGrid.  Added a setter/getter for grid.  For now it is public but perhaps it should be mx_internal.",
