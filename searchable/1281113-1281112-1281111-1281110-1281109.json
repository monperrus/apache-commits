   "For VideoElement and VideoPlayer, rather than having to load up the video source always, there's now a way just to load up an image.  This will help for cases, like Design View, where you just want a preview of a component and how it looks without necessarily loading up the whole video source.  The way to do this is through a new mx_internal property, thumbnailSource.  This gets pushed in to a BitmapImage object, so any type of source that BitmapImage supports will be supported by this property.",
