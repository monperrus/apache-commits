   "Fix variableRowHeight support in GridDimensions and other various bugs. These changes also fix Grid to follow the correct measure rules such as rowHeight having a real effect on the typical row height.", 
   "Grid.as - The rowHeight is now backed by GridDimensions.defaultRowHeight now. Moved some clearing code down to commitProperties.", 
   "GridDimensions.as - Removed fixedRowHeight. Instead, we use a variableRowHeight Boolean that reflects the Grid\u2019s value. The defaultRowHeight returns Grid\u2019s rowHeight if rowHeight is explicitly set. If rowHeight isn\u2019t set, defaultRowHeight returns the maximum typical cell height. defaultRowHeight also defaults to NaN now instead of 26.", 
   "GridLayout.as - Fixed an RTE from getItemRendererAt() in the case that bounds is null. Removed some excess code.", 
   "GridColumn.as - Fixed an edge case which was causing an RTE where someone sets the dataField to null.",

   "Added support for explicitWidth,Height to DefaultGridItemRenderer and UITextFieldGridItemRenderer.", 
   "Although UITextField and UIFTETextField both sport explicitWidth,Height properties (but not a common class or interface that defines them) they don't automatically set these properties when you set their width,height and they reset width,height when you call setActualSize().     Since GridLayout only uses setlLayoutBounds() to resize a renderer, I set a flag there so that the concomitant calls to 'set width,height' don't also set explicitWidth,Height.", 
   "Removed the renderer constructor code that initialized the renderers actual width to 4096.   We're already dealing with that in createTypicalItemRenderer(), so the constructor code isn't needed.",
