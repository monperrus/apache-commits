   "Some improvements to the distribution module:", 
   "* Include the JARs using Maven dependencies: the distribution now only depends on the axis2-* artifacts directly and transitive dependencies are included automatically by Maven, so that we don't need to maintain a separate sets of dependencies. This also has the advantage that the distribution can be built without building the entire project first (in this case the JARs will be downloaded from the snapshot repository).", 
   "* MARs and AARs are also declared as dependencies and the repository is built using the Maven assembly plugin.", 
   "* Got rid of the xxx.mar.version properties introduced as a quick hack in r553898 (see also AXIS2-4034). This is made possible by the changes in r777751.", 
   "* Build the modules.list and services.list files using a script."
