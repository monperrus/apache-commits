   "Fix for DIRSTUDIO-291. Added an 'Entry Value Editor'. When editing the objectClass attribute it opens a wizard (similar to the 'new entry wizard'). In the first step one could define the object classes, in the second step it is possible to edit the attributes, on finish it computes the difference between the orignal entry and the changed entry and sends these changes to the server. Also added an action 'Edit Entry' to the context menu that opens this wizard."
