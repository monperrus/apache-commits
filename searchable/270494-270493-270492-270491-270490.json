   "- Add \"label\" attribute on checkout per request from Greg Frank - checks out a specific view label.", 
   "- Add \"recursive\" attribute as in the deprecated <starteam> task.", 
   "- Add \"forced\" attribute as in the deprecated <starteam> task and avoid checking StarTeam statuses when true.", 
   "- Make sure all exceptions are caught on execution and rethrown as build exceptions.", 
   "- Fixed a bug (using the \"forced\" attribute) which were causing files to be incorrectly not checked out when a rootLocalFolder was specified because the StarTeam file statuses were being checked in relation to the default directory.", 
   "- Fixed a bug where files were deleted immediately after being checked out when a rootLocalFolder was specified because the task erroneously thought the file was not under starteam control.", 
   "- Code layout to fix weird indent issues.",
