   "Forgot several things from the last commit (including the log message...)", 
   "1.  Fixed group decl traversal implementation so that we neither ignore globally-declared", 
   "groups nor process them multiple times if they're referenced.  Similar", 
   "fix for attribute group declarations.", 
   "2.  Considerable cleanup of traverseGroupDecl, traverseGroupDeclFromAnotherSchema,", 
   "traverseAttributeGroupDecl, traverseAllDecl.", 
   "3.  Fixed a bug in traverseAllDecl which caused an infinite loop if elements with maxOccurs=0 were present in an <all> decl.", 
   "4.  Fixed a bug which caused nested elements in instance documents referring to a schema without a targetNamespace to be given a scope which precluded them from matching their declarations in the schema.  This bug appears to relate to the schema identity constraint implementation and there's a possibility this fix could break it."
