   "Adding a \"down\" state for item renderers when in touch interaction mode.  This means item renderers don't go in to the \"selected\" state when someone presses down on them.  They first go in to the \"down\" state.  If the user later starts scrolling or moving around, the item renderer returns to the \"normal\" state.  If they press down and release up on the same item, the item renderer will go from the \"down\" state to the \"selected\" state.  This distinction is necessary on touch devices to distinguish between \"down\" and \"selected\".  There's also a new \"selectedAndDown\" state.",
