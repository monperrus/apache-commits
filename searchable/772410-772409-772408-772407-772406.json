   "First cut at _changes api. Update the by_id and by_seq indexes to contain update seq numbers and pointers to bodies on disk, for use in the _changes api. This is a new file version, but the code can continue to serve the old 0.9 version without problems, though certain features in the _changes api will not be able to work. Upgrade to new file version (from 1 to 2) by compacting the file. Also fixed bugs with how the stats api tracks open databases."
