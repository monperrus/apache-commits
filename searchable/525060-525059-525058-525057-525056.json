   "Related issue: DIRMINA-365 (Make use of covariant return types)", 
   "* Applied covariant return types to all core classes (except VM pipe transport in trunk.  It needs more work.)", 
   "* We can't do much with covariant return type not introducing transport-specific session types such as SocketSession, so you will have to use trunk to get the most out of it.  1.1 has limited support on the other hand."
