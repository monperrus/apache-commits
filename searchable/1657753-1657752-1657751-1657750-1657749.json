   "Fixed a bug in level2 tabs where multiple tabs where highlighted at the same time when using @id for tab association/identification. Now only the relevant tab is highlighted. The new code is parallel to the level1 code a few lines above. Tested locally, and it seems to work as intended. I could not find any bug reports on this issue, although FOR-127 and FOR-128 might be related. Those are very old bug reports though, and likely outdated by now."
