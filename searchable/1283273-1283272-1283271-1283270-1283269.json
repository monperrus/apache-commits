   "Cleaning up lots of code, fixing some bugs, tweaking the API for List/Scroller, and tweaking the kinetics for Scroller.", 
   "Major API changes are:", 
   "1) Got rid of scrollAxis on IViewport.  We now just use horizontalScrollPolicy/verticalScrollPolicy.", 
   "2) No more overlay for horizontalScrollPolicy/verticalScrollPolicy.  Instead, we just key off of inputMode=\"touch\" to determine this", 
   "3) spark.events.TouchScrollEvent moved to mx.events.TouchScrollEvent", 
   "4) Added new API to help with testing: mx.utils.GetTimerUtil.mx_internal::getTimerFunction", 
   "We now use the distance scrolled as well as the velocity of that scroll to determine how far to throw the list",
