Improved CBR parent/child relationship in model to be more fine grained and pin point the actual when/otherwise, instead of being coarse grained and refer to the ChoiceDefinition. Made the end() a bit more intelligent to work with CBR. CAMEL-4044: Fixed CBR not having its child nodes enlisted in JMX."
