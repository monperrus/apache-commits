   "CTAKES-190 - Fixes most of relation-extractor issues. All code now uses SHARPKnowtatorXMLReader to ensure that all annotations are loaded with their correct type system types. Relation extractor classes produce DegreeOfTextRelation and LocationOfTextRelation objects. The modifier extractor has also been updated to work with the new types, but is not yet able to produce things like BodyLateralityModifier - instead it just produces generic Modifiers with their typeID set appropriately."
