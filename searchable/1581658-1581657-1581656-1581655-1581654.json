   "Allow the build to work on other JDK versions than 1.3 because 1.3 crashes when doing a full build. Sets the compiler source and target to 1.3. In this commit, the xercesImpl and xml-apis jar files are moved to the new java/lib/endorsed folder from java/lib. This is in preparation to building with Java >= 1.4 where Xerces and XML-APIs MUST be on the endorsed path in order to be recognized."
