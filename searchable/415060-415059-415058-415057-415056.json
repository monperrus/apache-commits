   "fix for issue TOMAHAWK-496. The schedule now has an extra attribute 'expandToFitEntries'. When this is set to 'true' the schedule checks for events outside the visible range and extends the visible range to display the events. If events only occur within the visible range, then no adjustment is made. Thanks to Peter Mahoney for the patch!"
