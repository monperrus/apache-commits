   "Here are some changes to DataGroup.", 
   "The big change is the way we instantiate components.  We aren\u2019t re-using the Group logic anymore.  This means there\u2019s no display object sharing going on, which reduces the complexity of the code.  It also treats renderers differently now.  Basically anytime a renderer is specified, it\u2019ll attempt to wrap you up in that renderer, even if you are a GraphicElement or a DisplayObject and may not need one.", 
   "There are some other changes, like changing an itemRenderer at runtime now works.  It\u2019s a bit heavy in what it invalidates right now, but I\u2019ll go back and revisit some of this logic.", 
   "Also, when no dataProvider is given, we don\u2019t automatically create one for the user.  This means I had to add some defense mechanisms where we were relying on the dataProvider, but doing a check for dataProvider != null was all that was really needed.",

   "DataGroup/Group split work.  DataGroup is for holding data items that may require item rendering. Group only holds visual items now.  The Group APIs stay the same (numItems, addItem, etc...).  DataGroup uses the IList APIs through its dataProvider.  So the equivalent methods are now dataProvider.length, dataProvider, addItem, etc...  This is just the initial split work as there's more to come to get the files up to spec.  We will also have to visit how we deal with graphic elements in DataGroup vs. Group.  For now the implementations are roughly the same.",
