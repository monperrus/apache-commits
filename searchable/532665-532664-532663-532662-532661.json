   "Failing to determine session size does not end request logging: typically this happens when something is not serializable (Hibernate session that is still open) and should be logged. However if the request log is not written, this makes fixing the issue a lot harder. This catch all already happens in RequestCycle#detach so it doesn't alter the behavior in a negative way by unwarrented catching of exceptions."
