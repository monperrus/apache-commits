   "Updated VIM_SSH.pm::_run_vim_cmd to detect if another process is attempting to run 'services.sh restart' to prevent multiple failed attempts. It does this by checking if the semaphore exists after a failed attempt. Added Module.pm::does_semaphore_exist. This calls Semaphore.pm::semaphore_exists.", 
   "Added utils.pm::set_reservation_lastcheck. This is called to set reservation.lastcheck to 20 minutes prior to the end of the reservation when VIM_SSH.pm detects uncorrectable problems. Updated utils.pm:update_reservation_lastcheck to not change the value if the current value is in the future.",

   "Updated Module.pm::new to not create a new management node OS object if the 'mn_os' argument was specified. It had been needlessly creating multiple objects."
