   "Split the Wookie-specific extensions to the Widget object from the implementation of the W3C standard interface (see WOOKIE-225). This means that any widgets that want to use the non-standard extensions must include the wookie/ext feature in their config.xml. Note that the \"setPreference...\" method is included in IWidgetAPI - this is because we still need some sort of \"post\" mechanism in the Widget interface; this could be removed in future and replaced with a basic XHR operation, which would remove the need for DWR libraries in most widgets."
