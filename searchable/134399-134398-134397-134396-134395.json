   "Reworked DigestScheme", 
   "- The qop Parameter is parsed correctly and not just ignored", 
   "- Missing qop is handled correctly", 
   "- DigestScheme is now prepared to handle the auth-int qop option", 
   "(even though an implementation is not possible with the current design)", 
   "- The public interface of DigestScheme is narrowed (as it is not needed by the tests any more)", 
   "- The test cases check the actual result rather than checking for equality after another run through the same logic.", 
   "Note: This is not simple for requests that require the client to generate a cnonce. Thos cases are still TODO.", 
   "- DigestScheme requires a nonce in every challange now", 
   "(according to RFC 2617) test cases changed accordingly",
