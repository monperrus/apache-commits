   "Work around a problem in the XMLStreamWriter of the StAX reference implementation, which fails to handle masked namespace bindings in the expected way. The solution is to implement all the namespace context related methods in a wrapper and only invoke methods on the underlying writer that don't require information from the namespace context. Note that the same technique could probably be used to work around the non conformance of XLXP."
