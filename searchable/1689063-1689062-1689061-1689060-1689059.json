   "[UIMA-4501] Provide concurrent-friendly set of sync locks to prevent loading the same class multiple times under the same class loader. Also did a slight bit of refactoring - made a new Utilities class, and moved things several classes were using as utilities into it. Added a test case that loads (using the same new instance of UIMA Class Loader) a class, on multiple threads, all released to go at the same time, and confirmed with the fix it worked, and without it, it gets the LinkageError exception (tested using IBM Java 7 on a Intel i7 8-core machine)."
