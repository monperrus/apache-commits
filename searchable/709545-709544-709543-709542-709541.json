   "In certain cases it might be desirable to override built-in URLStreamHandlers with services provided by bundles. We will first see whether there is a service for the protocol and if so use that one else, we try to lookup a built-in one as we do now. This includes the possibility to add locations to the default locations. What changes is that we first look at the services. (FELIX-756)"
