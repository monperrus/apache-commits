   "Removed code which overrode the vmdk controller type if it is set to IDE in the vmdk file and ESX is being used.  It now leaves the value set to IDE and the vmx file is configured with this value.  Added code to override the hardware version if it's set to 4 in the vmdk file, ESX is being used, and the controller type is IDE."
