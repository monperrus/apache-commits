   "Removed old URLConstructors. Fixed bug in StripesUrlContructor that caused it to exhibit slightly behavior different different behavior than DefaultUrlContructor. It now generates URLs identically. Method parsePage() was removed from UrlContructor's interface spec. (The only URLConstructor implementation is StripesUrlConstructor, anyway, it doesn't need to do any page-param parsing because the framework takes care of it.)"
