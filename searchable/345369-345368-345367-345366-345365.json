   "Some code clean up to resolve http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-974 - Allow users to define their own tree renderer", 
   "The treeRenderer attribute on the <netui:tree> tag with a Java class name of a custom TreeRenderer implementation to use for a given tree has been removed. The long term, prefered option/solution will be to do this with some Dependency Injection. Removing this attribute will avoid having to support and then deprecate these code changes. The support for using the new element in the NetUI config file to define a custom TreeRenderer (to use for trees in the entire web app) remains in place. This is the mechanism to use until we get DI support.", 
   "The TreeRenderer testRecorder file was removed but the test files remain so that it can be run manually (after editing the beehive-netui-config.xml).",
