   "[HBASE-8714] Add sync_file_range(WAIT) option to flush and compactions.",

   "Summary:", 
   "The idea here is that we don't want runaway compactions and", 
   "flushes to write faster than disk to OS/raid cache and then hit the", 
   "disks hard on a writeback. For this purpose we invoke a",

   "until the amount of data that it has written hasn't been persisted to",

   "1) All unit tests.",

   "[0.89-fb] [master] Allow regionServerReport to run with shorter RPC timeouts.", 
   "Author: aaiyer", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Our RS Expiry/Heartbeat mechanism relies on waiting 20 sec", 
   "before declaring a RS to be dead. The rationale behind this", 
   "is to give the RS 20 consecutive attempts before considering it", 
   "dead.", 
   "However, if the RPC timeout is set to 60 sec (by default); it is possible", 
   "that one regionserverReport takes up to 60 sec (to fail), and that", 
   "single failed call can cause the RS to expire.", 
   "We should shorten the RPC timeout for the regionserver report to ensure", 
   "we give the RS multiple chances before shooting it down.", 
   "2) Also including a bug fix around the instrumentation to log regionserver", 
   "reports. If the call to master.regionserverReport is unsuccessful; we should", 
   "preserve the old behavior and let the exception out. Specifically, the rest", 
   "of the code that follows the rsReport should only be executed, if the report", 
   "was successful.",
