   "Implement JIRA-1668 by storing the id attribute on the UIXComponentBase itself and modifying the UIXFacesBeanImpl to delegate back to the UIXComponentBase for id access through the AttributeMap.  I also cleaned up the way that ids and clientIds are generated so that getId() will never return a null id. In order to make the UIXComponentBase change backwards compatible, I moved the UIXFacesBeanImpl and UIXEditableFacesBeanImpl classes to api where our customers can take advantage of them and UIXComponentBase only caches the id locally if it is attached to an UIXFacesBeanImpl directly or indirectly through any levels of FacesBeanWrapppers.  In addition, several tests should have been extending FacesTestCase and were not, so those are now fixed.  Also, UIXEditableFacesBeanImpl now catches case where it is attached to a non UIXEditableValue component, which caught the fact that we had this incorrect entry:",
