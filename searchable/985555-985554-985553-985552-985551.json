   "[Bug 49629] - Part II of a fix for some build issues.", 
   "- All of the unit tests now pass in Eclipse, bar VersionTest (which is ok as it depends on a build system property).", 
   "- I reduced the number of endorsed jars in build.xml", 
   "- VersionTest now passes using maven and JDK 1.6.", 
   "- I had to do some hacking to get this to work. The pom now contains a dependency plugin, to copy the dependencies to the endorsed dir (target). It also has a jar plugin, to create jars for the source and test code, all in phase test-compile.", 
   "- I upgraded the Junit dependency to 4.8.1."
