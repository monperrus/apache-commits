   "Some more work - make XmlSchemaCollection (might need to change that name) the focus of read()ing schemas in.  Enable searching for elements/types by QName in a collection.  Only store the local name of types/elements, get the namespace from the enclosing XmlSchema object.  Fix problem with forward references (we now correctly slot the type values into waiting element/attribute declarations when types are encountered - still need to complain when unresolved types are NOT resolved by the end of a parse."
