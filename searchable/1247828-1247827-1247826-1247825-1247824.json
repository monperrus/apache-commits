   "\"Final\" rename of the transform-related effects - we are replacing the previous 'Rotate3D' effect (and its superclass, Animate3D) with the class formerly known as AnimateTransformRotate3D. The new class has all of the same functionality, but it is integrated in with the rest of the transform-related effects (effects which change transform properties should collude to avoid clobbering each others results). Some of the property names have changed to be more correct or descriptive, but the functionality should be the same.",
