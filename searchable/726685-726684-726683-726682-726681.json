   "DERBY-3934: Improve performance of reading modified Clobs.", 
   "There are two major changes with this patch:", 
   "a) The implementation of getInternalReader improves the performance of", 
   "getSubString significantly. This benefits the embedded driver too, but it", 
   "is crucial for the performance of all read operations on Clob from the", 
   "client driver.", 
   "Again, the mechanism used to get better performance is to keep an internal", 
   "reader around to avoid repositioning on every request.", 
   "b) Added caching and updating of the Clob character length.", 
   "Also added some tests for verifying that the Clob length is handled correctly.",
