   "Bug fix: Ebu's 2.3.75 fix had the undesirable side effect of hosing all relative URLs (while fixing all of the absolute ones). WikiContext has been reverted to its previous state. The real culprit turns out to be in DefaultURLConstructor.doReplacement(). We have added a web unit test suite to test for absolute URLs, and also for relative URLs (these are manipulated in jspwiki.properties prior to deployment of the test WARs)."
