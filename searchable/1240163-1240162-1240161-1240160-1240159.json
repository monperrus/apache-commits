   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3695: Failover using a JDBC Message Store and Virtual Topic can result in a lost message if queue is empty. Problem is that an empty destination is not recorded, as there is no entry in the messages table. Fix is to make use of the ack table, in the same way a for durable subs. For destinations that match the virtual topic filter, an entry out of priority range is added to the ack table. the startup destination query now unions over the ack and messages table"
