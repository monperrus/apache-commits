   "Removed import of net.jini.discovery.LookupLocatorDiscovery. The net.jini.discovery.LookupLocatorDiscovery class is not in the jsk-platform module, and causes a compile error when included as an import. The import is only required since it is used in the @see javadoc directive. Including the fully qualified net.jini.discovery.LookupLocatorDiscovery class in the @see directive resolves the issue."
