   "In broker, change RecoverableExchange[Impl]::bind() strings to const; they are never changed, and are only passed on to other methods that expect const strings. Makes it easier to work with from store.", 
   "In SQL store, fix the deletion of multiple bindings at once. Also, change the tblBinding table to store queue persistenceIds instead of names. Helps keep referential integrity with the queue table. Restoring bindings then just needs to look up the queue name from its ID before restoring each binding.", 
   "Fixes QPID-2169, and probably QPID-2170."
