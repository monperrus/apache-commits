   "Thrift: bug fix for interrupting server socket", 
   "Summary: TServerSocket uses a socket pair to signal interruption to the select() call on its main server socket.  A bug in the code prevented the select() from listening for events on the internal socket pair; in fact, it was accidentally listening to file descriptor 1.", 
   "Reviewed By: aditya", 
   "Test Plan: Use a server that supports a call to shutdown, which should signal an interrupt to the internal socket, and should result in an immediate and clean termination of the server socket thread.",
