   "We now do the hooking in the static method enableAccessibility(), which is called by code that is autogenerated by the compiler. Previously this method did nothing and the hooking happened at static initialization time. This allows us to remove the static var accessibilityHooked and the static method hookAccessibility() in each accessibility class.",
