   "This has been tested on a cluster with JMeter. BTW I found that UserLoginHistory can throw errors because it does not use a SeqId in PK but only login+fromDate. I guess there are other cases like that but in reality it's unlikely that someone log on 2 diff machines with the  same login at the same time (ms), just a JMeter side effect...",
