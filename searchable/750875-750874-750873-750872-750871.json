   "QPID-949, QPID-1633 : Set default Maximum Memory Usage for a queue to 100Meg. Future work would be to have the broker split Xmx between VirtualHost and for the Vhost then to use its housekeeping thread to spread the memory between the current queues. It could of course be clever and give more memory to queues in high use.",

So the FtD work is fully encapuslated by the QEI which delegates memory accounting to its list."
