   "1) Added WSDDTypeMapping.setSerializer(String) and WSDDTypeMapping.setDeserializer(String)",

   "serializer/deserializer factory classes.",

   "The following changes are made to improve interoperability.", 
   "- The ArrayDeserializer has been upgraded to use the", 
   "specific type= information if passed.  For example", 
   "if a specific type is set (not soapenc:Array) and", 
   "the arrayType attribute is missing, the deserializer", 
   "has enough information to continue.  See the comment", 
   "in the code.", 
   "- The ArrayDeserializer also sets a destinatation class", 
   "\"hint\" in the ArrayListExtension object.  This \"hint\"", 
   "can be used by the JavaUtils:convert() routine to", 
   "instantiate a more specific array.", 
   "- Added 12 more tests to test.encoding.TestDeser to", 
   "make sure Axis correctly deserializes xml array", 
   "messages that have missing attributes, etc.", 
   "Also included a test which deserializes an Object array", 
   "which has mixed elements (String and Integer).", 
   "- The getTypeFromAttributes routine in DeserializationContextImpl", 
   "has been extended to attempt to use the name qname as the", 
   "type if the type attribute is missing", 
   "(it already did this for soapenc primitives).", 
   "The .Net services sometimes don't set the type= attribute,", 
   "but the name of the", 
   "element is the name of the type.", 
   "- minor changes to the test client to more accurately reflect", 
   "the expected return types for arrays of xsd:int and xsd:float.", 
   "I ran the interop tests and we are still just as interoperable", 
   "(HP site was down). (I also ran the interop tests with Axis", 
   "passing the specific array type.  In these", 
   "tests Axis was slightly better than the last time.)"
