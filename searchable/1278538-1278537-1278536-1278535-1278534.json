   "Fixes and some code clean up for DataGrid. These fix issues with how the DataGrid looks when different indicators and separators are null. It also improves the look when the dataProvider is cleared.", 
   "GridLayout.as - Fix bug in layoutLinearElements() where we were allowing null values to stay in newVisibleElements. We should shorten the vector instead. Also, I fixed layoutSelectionIndicators() and layoutIndicator() to remove previously cached indicators when the factory is null. Lastly, fixed up layoutRow/ColumnSeparator to return the correct bounds when no item renderer exists. This is used in the case that we clear the dataProvider.", 
   "GridDimensions.as - Fix getPadRowBounds() so that it only never uses a negative index when calling getCellX and getColumnWidth.",
