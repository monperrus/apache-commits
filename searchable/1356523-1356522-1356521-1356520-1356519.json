   "Major performance boost to SPARQL TSV parser (25x performance improvement seen on a 3.5 million result file - 6s down from 150s)", 
   "Change to achieve this is to make the parser avoid calling into NodeFactory.parseNode() where possible by sniffing terms to see if they look like URIs/Blank Nodes based on the first character or so and assuming they are and just generating a Node directly in those cases.  We now only call into NodeFactory.parseNode() for literals because literals are complicated and we want all the nice escape handling the parser will give us."
