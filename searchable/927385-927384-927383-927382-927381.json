The regex that locates the line in /etc/hosts for the computer was modified to allow for both the short hostname and full DNS name in the hosts line.  Also added a warning message to _automethod if an attempt is made to call $self->data->[sub name], where [sub name] doesn't begin with 'set' or 'get'."
