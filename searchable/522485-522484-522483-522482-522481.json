   "Added sample for load balancing and failover endpoints. Sample service returns the port of the server in which the service is running. Sample client continuesly sends requests Synapse running on a specified port and prints the response for each request. So it is possible to observe how requests are distributed based on the load balancing or failover policy used."

   "Implemented the session affinity based load balancing for Synapse. Now Synapse can bind sessions to endpoints based on ServiceGroupID or any user defined binding mechanism. A simple client session based dispatcher, which identifies sessions based on ClientID header of request soap messages is provided to demonstrate this functionality.", 
   "Added the support for providing inline WSDLs for WSDL endpoints. Improved the WSDL endpoint factory and serializer. Added a test case to test WSDL endpoint serialization."
