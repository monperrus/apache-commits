   "a couple new utilites for struts2 support.", 
   "1. New code for supporting the tabbed menu rendering which is no longer a custom jsp tag using velocity.  The new code provides a few classes which deal with parsing the menu configs from xml, a few classes which are used to model a menu for use in rendering on the UI, a helper class for building a menu based on the current action/user/weblog combo, and a new tiles jsp used to render the menu.", 
   "2. A new interface and struts2 interceptor to support a Roller specific version of struts2's Preparable interface.  The UIActionPreparable interface works the same way except that instead of being executed early in the interceptor chain like the struts2 Preparable interface does, the UIActionPreparable interceptor is the very last in the chain which allows Roller actions to use data loaded by previous interceptors like the UIActionInterceptor.", 
   "3. Support for both the new menu code and new myPrepare() method are added to the UIAction class so that actions get built-in support and default implementations which they can override if they want to."
