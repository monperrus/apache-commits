   "Fixing Bugs #897 & #19152. They're very different reports,", 
   "but they're both symptoms of the same bug. We were keeping a list", 
   "of all the readers opened during a parse and only closing them after", 
   "we finish. This means if a document contains millions of internal entity", 
   "references we'll have a list of millions of references to StringReader", 
   "that cannot be garbage collected until we dump the list after the parse,", 
   "and since we don't close the streams until we're done, the operating", 
   "system may run out of file handles.", 
   "Solution: Once we've parsed an entity, close the reader and then", 
   "remove it from the list. If parsing halts for some reason, cleanup", 
   "the remaining readers as we already do.",
