   "RAVE-698: add a temporarily forked version of Spring RequestMappingHandlerAdapter.", 
   "The original Spring provided version of this class has a final protected handleInternal method as well as a private invokeHandlerMethod method.", 
   "Those two restrictions make it impossible to extend the class for our purposes.", 
   "The temporary forked version has these two methods 'hacked' open, e.g. now provided as non-final protected methods instead.", 
   "The HmvcHandlerMethodHandlerAdapter now can extend this minimally modified forked version to build up our own logic.", 
   "When/once everything works as needed a patch for the original Spring RequestMappingHandlerAdapter can be created and proposed for Springframework", 
   "so to be able to extend the original in the future and drop the temporary forked class."
