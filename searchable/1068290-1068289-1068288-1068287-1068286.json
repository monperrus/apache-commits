   "A patch from Stephen Rufle \"Checkout Shipping Options\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4162) - OFBIZ-4162", 
   "When the user selects a shipping option and moves to the next step and then comes back to the \"Shipping Options\" step the previously selected value is not selected on the screen. This is because in the ftl a comparison is made between shippingMethod and chosenShippingMethod. chosenShippingMethod is being escaped so the values will never match. The solution is to use wrapString on chosenShippingMethod.",
