   "I decided that this branch should have a tighter focus, so I'm renaming it from the JIRA key of the parent task (SCXML-137), to the JIRA keys of the two completed subtasks (138, 139), which better reflects its reduced scope. The next step will be to merge it back into trunk, and then branch again for the next subtask."
