   "o Clarified JavaDoc for basePackage instance member.",

   "basePath if called directly).",

   "instances of XML descriptor elements.  It first tries to use any value", 
   "passed in via the String parameter.  If that is null, it tries the", 
   "value for the element's className attribute.  Lastly, it tries the", 
   "simple heuristic which assumes that the class's name can be derived", 
   "from the XML element's name, and is in the parent element's package.", 
   "o Removed old duplicate inclusion() method.", 
   "o Removed elementClassName() and elementToClassName() (subsumed by", 
   "createInstance()).", 
   "o Added parsePrefix() helper to deal with classes which have no", 
   "package."
