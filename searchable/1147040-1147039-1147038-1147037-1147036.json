   "QPID-3283: make Authentication Manager pluggable.", 
   "Refactors AuthenticationManager and collaborators to allow of AuthenticationManager to be plugged in from the configuration XML. Change PrincipalDatabaseAuthenticationManager to become a pluggable implementation.  This change removes support for the <principal-databases> element within the config.xml.   Existing use-cases are supported by the new element <pd-auth-manager/> which enables use of the PDAM implementation. Also resolves QPID-1347.",
