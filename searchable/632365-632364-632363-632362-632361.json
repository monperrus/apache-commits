   "[UIMA-739] This change fixes the update site build so that the build includes previous versions of the features.  This allows the users of the Eclipse Update site to find and download previous versions, should that be needed.  Previous versions of the plugins are kept on the apache.org/dist/incubator/uima/eclipse-update-site.  Previous versions of the feature jars (these are very small) are kept in SVN, because it allows building when disconnected from the internet (otherwise, they would need to be downloaded from apache.org/dist).  They are kept in the top level \"features\" folder of the update-site project.  This folder's svn:ignore setting is removed in this change.  As part of the release process, committers should check in the non-SNAPSHOT versions of new builds when releases are done (I'll update our web-site)."
