   "Added inspector functionality.  We could use a nicer bug.png file since the wicket icon i have is too big for a nice inspector bug image.  Functionality is basic for now but might help find some bugs anyway.  WicketInspectorBug is a panel that you can attach to any page without fuss."

   "Added page class to IPageMapEntry so you can always find out what page class is returned by a page map entry.  This should make sophisticated eviction policies possible without being forced to invoke getPage() on subclasses of AbstractPageMapEntry in order to determine the page class.  The call IPageMapEntry.getPage().getClass() works, it's just not very efficient if there's an easy way to get the class directly without creating an object."
