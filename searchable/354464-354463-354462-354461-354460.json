   "NOT applying this patch. I found a better solution that will factor the interpolation of the POM into a flexible utility in plexus-utils, and will allow introduction of envar resolution to the POM. It will also make interpolating the settings.xml and profiles.xml using any of a number of expression resolvers (using envar resolution only for now).", 
   "BTW, I tried using System.getenv(..) in JDK1.4, and it fails with java.lang.Error and a deprecation message. So, I'm using Edwin's code to extract the envars into a Properties object. We can improve this later."
