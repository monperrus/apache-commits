   "[UIMA-3794]More fixes to get the default concurrency level and capacities set properly, and tested by the test case.  Also, make the compare test using ConcurrentMap have 16 locks (matching the concurrency level), not 1, for more realistic timing test. (Using one global lock causes the test to take a minute)"
