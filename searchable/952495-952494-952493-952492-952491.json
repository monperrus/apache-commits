   "The query that we used to fetch all children in BASE_NODE and WORKING_NODE", 
   "used a UNION between two SELECT statements. The idea was to have SQLite", 
   "remove all duplicates for us in a single query. Unfortunately, this caused", 
   "SQLite to create an ephemeral (temporary) table and place the results of", 
   "each query into that table. It created an index to remove dupliates. Then", 
   "it returned the values in that ephemeral table. For large numbers of", 
   "nodes, the construction of the table and its index becomes very costly.", 
   "This change rebuilds gather_children() in wc_db.c to do the duplicate", 
   "removal manually using a hash table. It does some simple scanning straight", 
   "into an array when it knows duplicates cannot exist (one of BASE or", 
   "WORKING is empty).",
