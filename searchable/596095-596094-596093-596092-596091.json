   "bug 5711: allow 'mass-check --reuse' without '--net' to reuse net-rule hits, and output mass-check results for scoreset 1; while lines that are not reusable use set 0.  Also, fix a few tests to use 'tflags net' if they use network lookups (including calls to lookup_ptr().)  Fix nightly mass-checks on the zone to use --reuse to gain this."
