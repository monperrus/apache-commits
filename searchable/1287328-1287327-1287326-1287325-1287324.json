   "TextAreaSkin no longer has a minimum size.", 
   "Glenn approved this change, despite the fact that the XD specs call for a minimum size of 36, because it was causing bugs such as SDK-16008 and SDK-20993. You might, for example, want a two-line TextArea whose height is less than 36 pixels.", 
   "A non-zero minimum size was first introduced in revision 6808 to fix bugs SDK-19785 and SDK-19807. But the underlying cause of these bugs -- infinite invalidation loops caused by Scroller trying to figure out whether to put up scrollbars or not -- has been fixed in Scroller by Hans.", 
   "This change is only part of the fix for SDK-20993; Scroller seems to be imposing a non-zero minimum size as well. Hans will make Scroller allow any size and hide its scrollbars if there isn't room for them.",
