   "fixed various bugs that I noticed while implementing the css contract/structurer example. e.g. output will now work as well for non markup formats and not wellformed markup formats (e.g. no root element)  because it will add the children instead of the first child to the output. Fixed path generation if the hooksXpath=\"/\". Capsulated repeating methods into helper. Allowed not to pass a hooks transformation xsl to the transformer, because txt outputs like css do not need hooks. Still any given format can implement hook transformation. In css one can think to group contracts in hooks which then get transformed into e.g. comments (like <hook id=\"test\"/> to /* test */). Fixed the generation of nodes in the result tree by using a method that is awar of simple xpath expression like node[@id=test]."
