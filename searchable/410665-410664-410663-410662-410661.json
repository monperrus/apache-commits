   "* Merges the latest version of checkDataSource and checkDataSource30 tests from trunk into 10.1 branch. I have tried to make the 10.1 files match as closely as possible to trunk files. I have not included the tests for following changes intended only for trunk - DERBY-412, DERBY-467, DERBY-571.", 
   "* Adds permission required to read system property to the testing jar and classes folder. These permissions are copied from the trunk.", 
   "* Adds jdbcapi/checkDataSource.java to derbynetclientmats suite. checkDataSource30.java does not pass with client. I think this is because changes for some of the bug fixes are not fully merged into 10.1. I am looking at this and will post with more information separately. I also see that some parts of checkDataSource30 test are still disabled with client though the corresponding bugs have been fixed.",
