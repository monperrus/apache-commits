   "[JS2-21] Missing Security Feature: Check roles assigned to any group to user belongs", 
   "Fixed the issue.", 
   "Now it conforms to the following requirements:", 
   "1. The Role definition in Servlet 2.3 SRV.12.4 (which according to portlet PLT.20.2 also applies for portlets) specifies that a user is in a specific role either when assigned directly to the user or when assigned to a group the user belongs to.", 
   "Thus according to this definition the isUserInRole() should also check the roles assigned to any group to user belongs to.", 
   "2. Concerning the following use-case:", 
   "assume the 'groovy.psml' has constraints allowing role 'admin' and group 'engineering' to view.", 
   "assume the user 'user' is only in group 'accounting' and doesn't have role 'admin'.", 
   "assume the group 'accounting' has no roles (initially)", 
   "-> the user doesn't get access to the groovy.psml.", 
   "Now add role 'admin' to group 'accounting'.", 
   "-> the user now has \"gets\" the role 'admin'", 
   "-> the user gets access to the 'groovy.psml'"
