   "Currently, when a ContentItem is submitted to an index which was created using a custom LDPath, the LDPath is only executed on the recognized entities through the Entityhub. This aims to gather additional information regarding to the entities of the ContentItem.", 
   "However, we would need to execute custom LDPath programs on additional RDF parts of ContentItems. Otherwise, it is not possible benefit from the additional parts. With this commit, SemanticIndexManagerImpl will execute the LDPath program on the RDF parts of ContentItem through the ContentItemBackend."
