   "Refactored result tree fragments to use XalanDocumentFragment instead of ResultTreeFragBase.  This is because the node-set() extension exposes some awkward problems with the implementation.  This also simplifies things, so although it changes our XObject interface, in the end, it's much cleaner.  Fixes Bugzilla 23778."
