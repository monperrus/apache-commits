   "Three problems with the original test case are fixed with this patch.", 
   "1. As the bug noted, the DataStoreConnection is acquired outside a", 
   "transaction, and there is no guarantee that the DataStoreConnection", 
   "is even valid after beginning a transaction. The code now acquires", 
   "the DataStoreConnection only after beginning a transaction.", 
   "2. If the implementation supports Optimistic transactions,", 
   "then the test should be repeated for both optimistic and", 
   "datastore transactions.", 
   "3. The transaction is never committed. This is fixed by putting", 
   "the DataStoreConnection close and the transaction.commit into", 
   "the finally block."
