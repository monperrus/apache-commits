   "Changed EventHandler interface so that the run method takes the new Event and RequestMap objects so it knows more about them; the service event handler and the service multi event handler now look at the request-map to see if the security -> https attribute is true and if it is then it will only allow encrypted body parameters to be passed to the service, or in other words it won't allow URL parameters that are not encrypted to be passed in; also changed the RequestHandler so that it will not accept http POST requests to request-map with security -> https=true; both of these changes better protect service calls from a webapp and protect better against XSRF and similar attacks since spoofing https is more difficult"
