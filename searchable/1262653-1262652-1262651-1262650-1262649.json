   "Fixes for Advanced CSS applying to inner components. The changes involved three areas:", 
   "1. mx.styles.StyleProxy needed updating to support IAdvancedStyleClient", 
   "2. mx.styles.StyleProtoChain required refactoring so that advanced selector matching functionality could be shared outside of this class (see next). The main change is in StyleProtoChain.addProperties() which is recursively called to handle the case when styleName is set to another IStyleClient (instead of a String). The change concerns the order of building the proto chain for this special case. Before advanced CSS, it seems we recursively did the following in the addProperties() subroutine:", 
   "- Find type selectors, add to proto chain", 
   "- Examine styleName:", 
   "- if a CSSStyleDeclaration, add it to the proto chain next", 
   "- if a IStyleClient, recurse again by calling addProperties to this IStyleClient", 
   "- if a String, apply class selectors to proto chain", 
   "- Finally, add inline style declarations to proto chain", 
   "Advanced CSS might involve other universal selectors that aren't necessarily class selectors (such as id selectors), or we could have type selectors that are more specific that class selectors. So the new logic for Advanced CSS is:", 
   "- Examine styleName:", 
   "- if a CSSStyleDeclaration, add it to the list of selectors", 
   "- Get all matching selectors, sort by specificity, and add to the proto chain.", 
   "- Then, if styleName was an IStyleClient, recurse again by calling addProperties to this IStyleClient", 
   "- Finally, add inline styleDeclarations to proto chain", 
   "A styleName pointing to an IStyleClient means that it has a very high specificity and will override any other selector. The only thing that continues to always win are inline style declarations which are added last to the proto chain.", 
   "3. mx.core.UIComponent.initThemeColor() needed updating to support advanced CSS selectors. This required the use of a new utility method in StyleProtoChain to find matching selectors.",

   "Bug fix for universal Advanced CSS selectors.", 
   "1. In CSS, the universal selector * matches any element. It is often implied in selectors, such as the .foo class selector would formally be written *.foo { }. So, what we were previously calling \"global selectors\" will now be referred to as universal selectors. Flex retains its own special top level \"global\" selector to function as the root of the inheriting style prototype chain, but other universal selectors will not be associated with this special subject.", 
   "2. When looking for universal selectors, we now match against all possible selectors that have * as the subject rather than trying to pick out specific styleName (class), id or pseudo conditions. This is needed as there may arbitrary advanced conditions in the selector chain, for example, descendant selectors that have a universal subject. Note this was the actual cause of the bug - but the other fixes were needed to separate \"global\" from \"*\".", 
   "3. In the compiler, we'll still use the generated _globalStyles.as (i.e. from the \"global\" StyleDef collection of style declarations) as the place holder for universal selectors (as _*Styles.as would be an invalid ActionScript class name), though these universal selectors will report their subject as \"*\".", 
   "4. When representing a selector in full as a String, we'll continue to omit \"*\" as the subject and substitute the empty string, so \"*.foo\" will be printed as \".foo\".",
