   "More work on the Job Scheduler:", 
   "1. Gave the job queue a fixed size so the job poller can't create an out-of-memory condition.", 
   "2. Changed min/max thread settings to more conservative values.", 
   "3. Changed JobSandbox polling code to accept a limit argument to control the number of records retrieved. Also used ELI to limit memory use.", 
   "4. Improved JobManager reloadCrashedJobs method to recover queued jobs that were being missed previously.", 
   "At this stage the Job Scheduler has been fixed to not crash/saturate the server, but it can still lose jobs. That will be fixed in the next commit."
