   "[HBASE-8206] Thread safety issues with Compression.Algorithm.GZ", 
   "Author: manukranthk", 
   "Summary: The Compression.Algorithm was not completely thread safe. Hence making it thread safe. Trying to fix this the same way it was fixed in HBase trunk(HBASE-5458).", 
   "Test Plan: Tested by running ClientSideScan(which opens store files in parallel to perform a client side merge) on the of the region servers on MORSE002-FRC3 cluster. Will try to write a test case which simulates exactly the same way. Also let me know if there is a better way to test this out.",
