   "Resolve a possible deadlock during system startup if system bundle stop is called from inside an activator.start method and the system bundle is still in the STARTNG state. The framework will now just throw an exception as a result of the stop call. As a side effect this makes it possible again to call System.exit inside an activator.start method while the framework is still in the STARTING state. However, the framework will not be shutdown when the jvm exits. (FELIX-1816, FELIX-1812)"
