   "Added in MessageContext as a property in the out/fault MessageContexts. This is needed in cases where an OperationContext is not created, for example, since the request never gets dispatched to the service operation, either due to a security failure or a request coming non-existing endpoint. A use case for this is a SOAP Tracer module which shows messages coming and and responses going out. If a WS-Security validation fails or if the request never gets dispatched to a service, and OperationContext will never get created, hence in the OutFlow, it will not be possible to access the in flow MessageContext. With this change, such thigns will be possible."
