   "A patch from Leon \"Add \"MUNICIPALITY\" to getStateList's search condition to make \"municipality\" of china visible in state list\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4258", 
   "In china, city like \"Shanghai\",\"Beijing\", \"Chongqin\" and \"Tianjin\" is municipality which is equivalent to province, but there's no such municipality in the state list displayed in client end.", 
   "In Geo entity, these municipalities is stored with geoTypeId=\"MUNICIPALITY\", So I add it as a new search condition to CommonWorkers.getStateList to fix this issue.", 
   "Fixes some problem in current GeoData_CN.xml", 
   "Also changes the geoTypeId from \"REGIONS\" to \"MUNICIPALITY\" for some \"Autonomous regions\" and \"Special administrative Regions\" and add some missing country-state associations.", 
   "It's better to add new geo types for \"Autonomous regions\" or \"Special Administrative Regions\", but I don't want to make the thing complex if there's no such strong demand."
