   "First checkin of new content-inspection package, designed to refactor SpamFilter functions into a series of stacked Inspector classes that can analyze and score content in multiple ways, including for spam detection. See the package.html and Javadocs for detailed descriptions on the API design. These features will be used by ANY and ALL ActionBeans to allow for spam filtering via the @SpamProtect annotation and SpamProtect JSP tag. Three notable limitations of this checkin: 1) no CAPTCHA integration yet; 2) Comment.jsp is temporarily broken; 3) User registration not hooked into content inspection just yet. All will be addressed soon."
