   "DERBY-706 Improve testing and increase code coverage for Network Server classes", 
   "have attached a second patch 'derby-706_2.diff' which adds some more tests and re-arranges/removes some internal methods. Details of patch are:", 
   "* DDMWriter: Removes min method because Math.min is used. Use doesRequestContainData() method.", 
   "* DDMReader: Use readCodePoint() method", 
   "* DRDAConnThread: QRYOPTVAL codepoint is not part of DRDA spec. parseCcsidSBC was giving NPE.", 
   "* CodePointNameTable: Add codepoints to be used in protocol.tests", 
   "* protocol.tests: Added tests to cover methods which were not tested before.", 
   "* Session, DRDAStatement, Database, DRDAProtocolException: Remove some methods which are not needed. The same can be done using other methods.", 
   "* TestProto: Use lookup method.", 
   "* testProtocol: Added \"derby.drda.traceAll=true\" to derby.properties file to test methods in DssTrace", 
   "* testProperties: Added test for trace off command. Added \"derby.drda.traceAll=true\" to derby.properties file to test memcheck.", 
   "* runtimeinfo: Rearranged test because the output was not predictable on different jvms/machines.", 
   "Ran derbyall with Sun JDK 1.4.2 on WinXP. No failures.",
