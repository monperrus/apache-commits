   "Refactoring making it possible to override default Uri parsing behavior. This allows implementations to choose to accept URIs with technically (per RFC 2396) illegal characters in them, for instance (^, |, and others) that are nevertheless accepted in many contexts.", 
   "Those choosing to override this behavior can choose static injection or simply call Uri.setUriParser(UriParser) depending on the preferred syntax. By default, the existing implementation (now in DefaultUriParser) is used. Static injection is used due to the large number of Uri.parse(...) callers at the moment.", 
   "A logical extension of this work is to clean up all direct uses of URI in the Shindig code base and replace them with Uri to avoid potential inconsistencies. As well, Uri.resolve(Uri) should be implemented manually to better support consistent leniency."
