   "Fix for http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-32119.  Label truncation did not always work correctly if it was taking next from the next TextLine and moving it up to the line that was being truncated.  Note that the same scenerios in RichText are still broken since the truncation algorithm for that is in TLF not Flex.  Label started with the same algorithm but it has been modified as we've found various problems with it."
