   "Fixed a bug in filtering services based on package wirings. If the service", 
   "provider did not import the package containing the service interface (e.g.,", 
   "perhaps the interface was implemented by an imported superclass), then", 
   "filtering would fail because it was only trying to load the class from", 
   "the bundle that registered the service object, but it did not have access", 
   "to it. Modified the algorithm to use a more exhaustive approach to determine", 
   "where the class comes from in such scenarios."
