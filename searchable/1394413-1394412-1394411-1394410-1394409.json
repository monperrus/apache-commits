   "CAMEL-5683: SendProcessor should not use a soft cache as we want the producer to be kept around, as we only store a single producer. This prevents the producer to be GC when running low on memory, that can cause Camel JMS component using temporary queues with request/reply to create new producer, and not re-use existing. Causing a leak for message listeners over time."
