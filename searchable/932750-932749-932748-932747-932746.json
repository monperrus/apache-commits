   "Added conformance tests for the parser; these are the same test cases that we run against the Wookie server, but in this case are evaluating the W3CWidget object created by the parser, rather than what gets served out by Wookie when running as a servlet. This is important as we need to make sure that the parser is behaving correctly when it gets used by other kinds of applications."
