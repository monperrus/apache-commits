   "Added condition to State.pm::reservation_failed to check if an 'inuse' process failed and the end time has been reached. If this is the case, the request state is set to complete and the computer state is set to failed. It had been setting the states back to 'inuse' causing the request to remain in the database indefinitely, constantly being processed.",
