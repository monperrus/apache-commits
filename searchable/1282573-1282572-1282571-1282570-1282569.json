   "Fixes bug with scrollbar behavior when fixedThumbSize behavior is enabled. Previously, the thumb was treated as if it were variable size (the default), where the size was related to the pageSize. This meant that a smaller thumb would never reach the end of the track. The new behavior ensures that the smaller fixed-size thumb covers the full range of the track.",
