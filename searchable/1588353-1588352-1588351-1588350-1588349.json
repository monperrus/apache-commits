   "The \"initialize\" phase for the \"reserve-network-port\" goal was too aggressive: it trigged network port reservation", 
   "even for simple tasks like \"compile\" or \"javadoc\". Use \"pre-integration-test\" phase instead. One possible issue is", 
   "that the \"start-jetty\" task also uses the \"pre-integration-test\" phase but need to be executed only after the port", 
   "reservation. A quick test suggested that tasks in the same phase are executed in declaration order. We hope that", 
   "this assumption is stable."
