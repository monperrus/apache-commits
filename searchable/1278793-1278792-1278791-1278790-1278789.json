   "SDK-19990 \u2013 DropDownList was eating ENTER, preventing default button from firing, should only do so when drop down is open.", 
   "SDK-19988 \u2013 Editable data grid should disable default button since ENTER has a control specific meaning in edit mode.", 
   "SDK-19985 \u2013 Editable data grid was disabling default button globally but forgetting to restore it on focus out.", 
   "Also made a usability change after talking with Joanne (bless her little heart), when a control disables default button behavior (such as TextArea does , because ENTER means to insert a new line), we now make sure to de-emphasize the default button visually, to hint to the user that it\u2019s not active.  Historically it was always emphasized but ENTER just never activated it.", 
   "QE Notes: Be aware that when a control disables defaultButton globally (FxTextArea does this), default button is no longer emphasized.",
