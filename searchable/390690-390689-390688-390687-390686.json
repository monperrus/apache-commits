   "Major refactoring of the plugin, aiming to spin off any generic IDE related util that can be used by others similar mojos (e.g. the Idea one). All the common stuff is now done in a generic abstract IdeSupportMojo which takes care of manual dependency resolution, source and javadocs downloading, sorting of referenced projects, handling of common messages and flags.", 
   "Integrating some bits from the Idea plugin for artifact resolution, and fix it so it doesn't require reactor projects to have installed artifacts at all.", 
   "All the existing unit tests work without problems after the refactoring (also with the removal of a reactor artifact from the test repo). Test #7 is commented out at the moment since it randomically fails due to the random order used in .classpath and .wtpmodules (test does line by line comparison)."
