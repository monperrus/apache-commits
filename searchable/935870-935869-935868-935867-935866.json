   "At some point the behavior of initEntityEcaHandler() was changed so that a new handler wasn't inititated if the delegator already had one.  The broke the test delegator because it requires a new handler be created for it rather than inherit the one provided by the delegator that it cloned.  Worked around by setting the handler to null on the while making the test delegator before calling initEntityEcaHandler()."

   "Fix a problem reported by Bob Morley in OFBIZ-3663.  When a delegator is cloned during test execution then the test mode isn't inherited by the new delegator and subsequently any changes made by that delegator are not tracked for rollback.  Fixed by setting the testMode of the new delegator to match that of the one being cloned."
