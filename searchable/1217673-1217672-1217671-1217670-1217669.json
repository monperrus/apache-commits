   "Room Administration: In the Administration I just encounter an Issue with 0.8.4 the Admin Panel and Rooms as the Admin-Panel expects that there is at least a number in the Field *demo-Time* ... so when you try to add a new Room it says System Error. You can workaround that by enabling *Demo Room* (the ceckbox) enter a number in *demo Teim* .. you can then disable that again and save the Room.", 
   "But okay that was all about Administration ... you are saying you miss the Top-Bar when you enter a Room.", 
   "=> this should fix it"
