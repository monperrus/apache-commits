   "Use basic authentication as a motivating scenario for looking at policy plug points. Generic username/password processing is added as an interceptor. Specific axis configuration is performed by new logic specific to binding.ws which is invoked if the basic auth policy is present (we need to think about this mechanism). I added a binding-ws-axis2-policy module as a replacement for policy-security-ws but haven't moved over to it yet. I also added a message header map to Message but have only been experimenting to date."
