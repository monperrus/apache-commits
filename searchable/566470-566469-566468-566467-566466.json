   "The JSON and Ajax ServiceBindingProviders were incorrectly calling componentContext.createSelfReference() to get a proxy to the target ComponentService, and this was not working (NPE) with bindings declared on component services (although it was working by chance for bindings declared on composite services if you had no other binding declared on your first component service...). Since a self reference is configured to use the binding from its corresponding service for outgoing calls, it shoulnd't  be used to dispatch incoming calls to the component service, unless you want to go back out to the network :). I fixed the ServiceBindingProviders to use the correct runtime wires from the target service to create a proxy instead of using a self reference."
