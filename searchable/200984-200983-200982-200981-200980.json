   "1) Created an ExtendedShape class that can give an ExtendedPathIterator", 
   "that may return SEG_ARCTO.  So we can properly implement markers on", 
   "paths that have elliptical arcs in them.", 
   "2) These new interfaces also do not collapse multiple moveTo calls into", 
   "one moveTo.  This allows a path consisting of many 'm' or 'M' commands", 
   "to place markers on the canvas.", 
   "This update fixes a long standing bug in the rendering of", 
   "markersOrientA.svg", 
   "3) Updated MarkerShapePainter to take advantage of these interfaces", 
   "(calculating the tangent at the end of an elliptical arc is a pain).", 
   "4) Added a new test 'paints/markersExt.svg' for move paths and", 
   "elliptical arc paths (it's funny to look at in the old Batik).", 
   "5) Added new markers test and the 'filters/feGaussianDefault.svg' to",
