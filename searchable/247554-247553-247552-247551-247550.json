   "Fix for Bugzilla Bug 10646:", 
   "When echo?wsdl is requested, the generated wsdl uses xsd:base64Binary", 
   "to describe the echoHexBinary request and response.", 
   "Solution:", 
   "The root of this problem is line 1070 in the Java2WSDL Emitter.", 
   "The writePartType takes an (javaType, xmlType) pair to write the", 
   "message part.  The Emitter was sending the proper javaType, but", 
   "was sending the name of the element instead of the qname representing", 
   "the type.  The wrong combination of arguments meant that writePartType", 
   "always resorted to intropspecting javaType to determine the", 
   "type to write.  And in this case, a byte[] maps to xsd:base64binary.", 
   "Changing the Emitter code to pass in the correct QName fixed the 10646", 
   "bug, but revealed a number of other hidden bugs during testing.", 
   "The following additional changes were made:", 
   "* Changed the Types:writeType(javaType) method to", 
   "Types:writeType(javaType, qName) so that it could be called", 
   "with both the javaType and xmlType pairing.  Similar change", 
   "to writeTypeNamespace.", 
   "* Removed defaulting to the DefaultSOAP12TypeMapping.", 
   "* Fixed some problems with the setting up the TypeMapping on", 
   "the temporary ServiceDesc's set up by the Emitter.", 
   "* Change the java2wsdl calls for the Roundtrip testcase to", 
   "use the appropriate typeMappingVersion.",
