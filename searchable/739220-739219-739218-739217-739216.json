   "Update the calculator-rmi sample Ant build scripts so that they work and use the simple way to build the sample jar. The calculator-rmi-service build creates an SCA contribution, the calculator-rmi-reference creates an 'unmanaged' jar which use the Node APIs to start a runtime, the only difference in the build.xml is the additional pathelement for the tuscany-node-api jar for the unmanaged one"
