   "Fixed two problems:", 
   "1) Entity reference and entity content. Previously, I was storing", 
   "the literal value of declared internal entities in the entity", 
   "node under the doctype. Then, when fluffing up the entity ref", 
   "children, the literal value would be copied over the entity ref", 
   "children. Oops!", 
   "2) Once I fixed the first bug, then I noticed that I had a ref", 
   "counting problem in my cloneNode(int,boolean) method. As the", 
   "diff shows, you should *not* try to circumvent the setter method", 
   "for the parallel arrays. Otherwise, the reference counting will", 
   "not work correctly and eventually you'll get a NPE."
