   "Clean up some confusing APIs. Previously, some of the getXXX methods would create things as a side-effect, and others would not. And some took a boolean create-or-not parameter. Now, all get methods are side-effect-free except for getInstance(), and a getOrCreate version exists to force creation of objects."
