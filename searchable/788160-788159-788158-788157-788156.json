   "Test to push down the default binding configuration into the URI builders so that the binding uri can be calculated with a user specified default root. If this works out need to update the real CompositeBuilder interface however I notice Raymond has recently added so info to the bindings that makes this easier so will re-work to use that. Also need to add mechanism for bindings to determine their own default base URI when none is specified."
