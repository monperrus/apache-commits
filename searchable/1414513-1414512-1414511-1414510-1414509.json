   "Add a Charset field to the two root abstract socket classes that provide a common base implementation for socket-based subclasses. The default value is the platform encoding. Subclasses can now use this value instead of relying on APIs that do not specify an encoding. For example String#getBytes(Charset) instead of getBytes(). The behavior is unchanged but the FindBugs emits fewer warnings. Note that it is now easy for subclasses to specify an encoding consistently. If you search for \"UTF-8\", you find uses of the \"UTF-8\" encoding and of the platform encoding in the same class, which are likely bugs. These can now be fixed in a much easier and consistent manner."
