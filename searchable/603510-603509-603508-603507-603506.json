   "This is a very temporary fix for an issue probably introduced in rev. 568816: when more than one *non* serialized inventory is received from a shipment (for example two different product ids) then only one inventory item is created for the first product and then updated for the second (overriding the product id in the first item).", 
   "This is caused by the way the parameters.inventoryItemId is set and used inside this service.", 
   "I need help to provide a better fix because I don't understand completely the scope of the changes introduced in rev. 568816."
