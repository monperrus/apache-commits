   "Add the new value in put() to strongreferences queue by default to solve the test reliability issue with SHIRO-96 (because account info in memory realms may get garbage collected). However, this doesn't ultimately solve the issue as values that don't fit to strong references would still get garbage collected. Additionally, there's no need to use a cache for memory realms anyway - see SHIRO-49 for that."
