   "Fixed a bug which was causing reservations to fail if the node was not properly added to the gkh file.  Added regular expression to utils.pm::run_ssh_command which removes the known hosts warning message from the SSH output.  This message appears if the host is not listed in /opt/xcat/etc/gkh.  It was causing problems in calling subroutines if they expect the output to exactly match a certain format."
