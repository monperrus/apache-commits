   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2868 - rework to remove sync on transaction completion, cursor updates are now stacked so that they ocurr in order, independent of thread execution after waiting for the journal to complete a write. This ensures that the cursors are updates in the same order as the index while still working wo the index lock. TransactedConsumerTest shows horizontal scaling now works better with transactions. Reworked metadata.lastUpdate to always work with the existing index lock rather than reaquire, this may help with spurious gc journal data file issue on windows - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3470"
