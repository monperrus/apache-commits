   "disable this testcase since it  doesn't run through with Java 1.4. The problem is that the included Spring configuration files can't be found. It seems to be a Maven 2/Java 1.4 related problem. I'm not willing to invest anymore time into this and for that reason I disable the test for the release. Java 1.4  support is really a PITA because any of the committers seems to use it and then it's me who has to deal with that problems."
