   "Change the service control from being free-threaded and managing state in ThreadLocals to managing state internally.  Controls are meant to be stateful, and things like the JdbcControl aren't intended to be free-threaded.  This change makes the state management consistent with the other system controls shipped in Beehive.",

   "Differences from the original patch:", 
   "- switched to using commons-logging instead of Log4J in some of the tests", 
   "- fixed some of the tests to use StringHolder rather than GenericHolder.  Apparently, this was necessitated by the change to Velocity.  I think this was the right thing to do (the tests pass...), but Chad, can you take a look at this and sanity check the changes?  Thanks!",
