   "- add CogJGlobus back: OODT-22 WIP. Note: i had to add a non-Maven central remote repository to get this done. I don't think this is a blocker to starting to roll RC's for 0.1-incubating, but it's likely something we'll want to fix before we release. Unfortunately that fix requires getting something set up at Sonatype OSS hosting, which is more than I can get done this weekend. So i'm pushing forward regardless, but let's not forget to deal with this later."
