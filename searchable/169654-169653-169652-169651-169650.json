   "- Added a quick usage guide in the documentation.", 
   "- Fixed issue where <code>clover:report</code> was not calling <code>clover:on</code> leading to an error when generating the reports.", 
   "- Ensure that <code>clover:init</code>, <code>clover:on</code> and <code>clover:off</code> can only be called once. For example calling <code>clover:on</code> twice in a row will execute it only once.", 
   "- The <code>clover:*-report</code> goals do not call <code>clover:test</code> anymore. They only generates Clover reports. This is now aligned with the <code>clover:report</code> behavior. To run the full thing, execute the <code>clover</code> goal or add the Clover report to your project's POM.", 
   "- Added a <code>maven.clover.multiproject</code> property that should be set to true in your master project (if you're using a multiproject setup). Setting it to true will make the <code>clover</code> goal and the <code>maven-clover-plugin</code> report in your POM execute on all subprojects (they'll call the new <code>clover:multiproject</code> goal).", 
   "- New <code>clover:multiproject</code> goal to run Clover on a multiproject setup.", 
   "- New <code>clover:merge</code> goal that creates a new Clover database by merging several other databases specified using the <code>maven.clover.merge.databases</code> property (which defaults to <code>**/clover_coverage.db</code>)."
