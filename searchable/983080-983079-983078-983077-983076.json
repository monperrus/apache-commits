   "[UIMA-1846, UIMA-1847] removing executions - not needed, reduce clutter. Fix the use of Require-Bundle - the extra blanks in front of the lines in the POM used to align these there were showing up in the manifest, and if there were enough of them, the manifest stopped working when it was loaded by Eclipse.  Also, needed to add org.eclipse.core.runtime to the Require-Bundle set, and excluded it correspondingly (as required by OSGi) from the <Import-Package> list.  Otherwise the generated manifest would be missing things. This change happened when a later version of the maven-bundle-plugin upgraded the way manifest entries were built."
