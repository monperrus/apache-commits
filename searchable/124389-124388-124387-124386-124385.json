   "I'm done playing around now. I kinda feel like I figured out what shape gump would take were I to start from scratch, and I also have a feel now how much work that would be (a lot, but less than I thought). The task now is to figure out how to integrate my many ideas piece by piece into the gump trunk in a not-so-disruptive manner. I'll probably be referring to this experiment in future e-mails :-D"
