   "Fix a small bug in the show description tootip feeding (related to autocomplete and lookup)", 
   "It was cutting the 1st part in case of composed names (like \"Tiny Gizmo\").", 
   "Actually this is a compromise because it's impossible to correctly handle all cases w/out a deep (maybe impossible) refactoring on searchFields in Lookups screens definition.", 
   "So now for few lookups, tooltips descriptions will possibly contain more/redundant information than before (like \"admin THE ADMINISTRATOR\" in Order Creation, instead of only \"THE ADMINISTRATOR\" before) but by and large the behaviour will be better (ie descriptions will contain more complete information). This is obvious for products lookups for instance, but not only....", 
   "I have tried to generalize using the same logic in lookupDescriptionLoaded (in adding a showDescription parameter), but gave up as it was making things more blurred than before", 
   "I don't backport: more an improvement than a real bug"
