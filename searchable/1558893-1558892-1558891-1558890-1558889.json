   "[HBASE-10360] Expose the HRegionLocations for each HTable in an efficient way", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary:", 
   "After discussing with Calypso team, they are currently using HTable.getHRegionInfo() to get all the HRegionLocation information. This function is relatively expensive because it needs to scan through the META region to get all the Region to ServerAddress mapping. And Calypso needs to issue this function call for each query. So this following new API will return the cached HRegionLocation directly without querying the META. In the most cases, the cachedLocations is relatively update-to-date and Calypso is also able to tolerant the stale information as well.",

   "Test Plan: Run the unit test for this new API to make sure both HTable.getHRegionInfo() and HTable.getCachedHRegionLocations() returns the same data.",
