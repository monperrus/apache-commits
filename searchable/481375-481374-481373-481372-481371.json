   "Introduce the second custom Commons SCXML action available to Shale dialogs out-of-the-box. The action with local name \"view\" (and namespace whose URI is defined in Globals.CUSTOM_SCXML_ACTIONS_URI) may be used to associate the next view state with the identifier of the JSF view to be rendered while the dialog is in that state.", 
   "This provides a declarative alternative to specify a view ID in addition to the procedural alternative (DialogStateMapper). In presence of both means, the declarative specification gets priority as one would expect (and allows for special casing, conditionals etc.). This should cover most application requirements for mapping the SCXML states to views.",
