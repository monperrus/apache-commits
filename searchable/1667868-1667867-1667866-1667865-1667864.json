   "Changed Linux firewall code so that it doesn't rely on the management node private IP address which cannot be reliably determined. Instead, access firewall access is granted to all IP addresses bound on the management node.", 
   "Added Linux.pm::grant_management_node_access. This allows traffic on any port to all of the MN's IP addresses.", 
   "Added check in Linux.pm::enable_firewall_port if an attempt is made to enable port 22 with the force option. This subroutine now calls grant_management_node_access and only proceeds if it returns true. This should help eliminate the possibility of a MN locking itself out.", 
   "Added call to grant_management_node_access in disable port if the port is 22. It only proceeds if grant_management_node_access returns true.", 
   "Added OS.pm::get_ip_addresses which is used by grant_management_node_access.", 
   "Changed Linux.pm::post_load to call disable_firewall_port('tcp', 22) instead of attempting to enable TCP/22 for the management node's private IP address.", 
   "Changed Linux.pm::sanitize to call process_connect_methods with an argument of 127.0.0.1 instead of the MN's private IP address.", 
   "Changed ManagementNode.pm::initialize to not return false if the management node's private IP address cannot be determined."
