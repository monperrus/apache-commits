   "fixed bug where sometimes invalid markupstream would be used when rendering fragment and so a \"cannot resolve component in markup\" error is thrown", 
   "the problem was that public final void render(final MarkupStream markupStream) class setMarkupStream(markupStream); but the passed in markupStream belongs to the parent and somewhere later is resolved to the correct \"associated\" markup stream - but the fragment rendering can happen in between those two events so the markupfinder would try to use the temporarily wrong parent markup instead of the associtated markup. the worse thing is that this would only happen when you navigate back to a page that was passed in as an instance to another page. the whole markupstream thing is a gigantic pain in the ass and should be replaced as soon as possible. jjjjjuuuuuueeerrrgggggeeeeennnnnnn :) just tracing this gave me a pounding migraine!"
