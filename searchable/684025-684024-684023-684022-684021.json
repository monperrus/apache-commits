   "COUCHDB-103 Fixed incompatibilty with new javascript (1.8) that no longer supports sealing document, making them immutable. The problem is arrays can no longer be sealed, and an error is generated when it is attempted. The fix here is to simply remove the document sealing, and map function placed in the same design document will have to be trustworthy that they don't modify the document (the same document is passed to multiple map functions). Non-trustworthy map functions can be placed in their own design documents, they will be run in isolation."
