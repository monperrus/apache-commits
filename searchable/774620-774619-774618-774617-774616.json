   "DERBY-4062: Remove single-argument getDataValue overrides from DataValueFactory", 
   "This change simplifies the DataValueFactory interface by removing the", 
   "single-argument overrides of the getDataValue() method. This change extends", 
   "the work that was done by Dan in 2007 in revision 540791. The large number", 
   "of single-argument overrides was complicated and clients could accidentally", 
   "call the wrong override, particularly since there was an override which", 
   "took an argument of type Object. As suggested by Knut, the new implementation", 
   "replaces calls to the single-argument getDataValue method with direct calls", 
   "to the constructor of the desired data type. The new code is simpler and", 
   "easier to read, and the data type usage is more self-evident in the system", 
   "catalog row factories, which are the principal users of the single-argument", 
   "getDataValue calls."
