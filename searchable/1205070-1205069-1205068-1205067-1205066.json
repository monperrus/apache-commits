   "[KARAF-1029] Modified shells Option annotation so that a completer hint can be passed. CompletableFunction now also returns a list of Optional Completers (completers for option values). Bumped the shell.xsd version 1.1.0 that contains a new element called optional completers. Modified the NamespacheHandler to support both versions of the xsd. Modified unit tests to also test the optional completers where available."
