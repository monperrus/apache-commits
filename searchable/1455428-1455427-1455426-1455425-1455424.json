   "Refs #453: Added Bootstrap templates for `prefs_userinterface.html` and `prefs_language.html`. The //userinterface// template had been added to Trac in [trac 11129] (i.e. after Trac was imported to the Bloodhound repository), therefore this is part of the work towards #453.", 
   "More work needs to be done towards uniform styling of the preference panels. For example, the ''Keyboard Shortcuts'' and ''User Interface'' panels have similar elements and structure, but look significantly different at this time. They can be compared to determine what styles might be better to adopt going forward."
