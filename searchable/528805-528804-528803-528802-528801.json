   "Added code so that the feature category stuff would actually do something instead of just treating the feature category ids as feature ids; this required use of a view-entity in a sub-select which required a bunch of lower level changes so that the DatasourceInfo settings would actually be used in the sql generation stuff; all seems to be working now, at least on derby"

   "A fairly dramatic change required because the DatasourceInfo stuff was being mostly ignored for most of the sql generation code, especially in the view entity stuff; fixing this resulted in a problem with derby requiring adding the alias-view-columns=false attribute to the datasource element in the entityengine.xml file; in any case, the somewhat tricky and funny but useful option of using a view-entity in a sub-select is now working properly"
