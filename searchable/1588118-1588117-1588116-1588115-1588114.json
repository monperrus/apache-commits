   "[Master] Fix TestRegionChecker", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary: There was a bug in the TestRegionChecker. In the unit tests, the test function tries to verify whether avDetDayAfter contains all the re-assigned regions. However, the ROOT region will not be included in such collection based on the design of the HRegionChecker. Therefore, the fix is to exclude the ROOT region from the checking.",

   "Summary:", 
   "TestRegionPlacement can be flakey even after the last change.", 
   "There are several differernt things fixed here:", 
   "* The test where servers are killed make tests hard to compute", 
   "* Sometimes regions take a while to open because there are other things happening (other tests or slow disk)", 
   "* Sometimes metrics are in flux.", 
   "* Sometimes meta is in the middle of being updated.", 
   "So the final solution was:", 
   "* Add script to help with running tests in a loop to try and see how stable things are.", 
   "* Split tests into test cases that kill servers (Only one currently) and other that are non-destructive.", 
   "* Split up test cases into multiple tests", 
   "* Added code to make sure that region placement has reached a stable place before asserting anything.", 
   "* Added code to make sure that table creation and assignment is complete.", 
   "* loosened up the testing of number region opens as it's possible that regions take too long to open up and so are opened on non preferred servers.",
