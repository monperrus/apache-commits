   "Async dispatches require similar handling to RequestDispatcher.include() hence the implementation of async dispatch uses RequestDispatcher.include()", 
   "However, since RequestDispatcher provides no API for differentiating between and INCLUDE and DISPATCH some form of trickery has to be used. The previous implementation worked in most cases but failed in some cases (multiple forwards prior to dispatch, wrapping the request).", 
   "This alternative implementation calls a specific method on the RequestDispatcher implementation (we have to access the implementation class since we can't modify the servlet API) which removes any ambiguity and allows the correct handling in all cases."
