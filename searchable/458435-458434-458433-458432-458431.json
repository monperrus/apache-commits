   "Added inspector bug to all example applications.  You can actually see a few pages in the session in the more complex applications, like hangman.  The bug itself is too big.  If someone out there can draw, i'd like to see a little orange circle just like the logo with a lower case italic letter 'i' on it in white.  That would be a nice wicket inspector bug."

The Inspector is a stateless page and I made some stateless pages in my own app and also added BookmarkableWebPage, although it's likely that this class won't be that useful since most people will have their own hierarchy to hang bookmarkable pages off."
