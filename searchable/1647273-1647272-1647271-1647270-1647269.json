   "Refactoring of Visit/Visitor/ServerHit* (and related) entities in order to be able to maintain them in a database separate from the main transactional database:", 
   "1) removed foreign key relationship from/to this group of entities and the other entities of the OFBiz data model; the fields are still available but they are not enforced by a foreign key constraint", 
   "2) removed one view entitiy joining Visit with Party entities and refactored the code that was using it in order to provide the same behavior", 
   "3) added a new entity group (\"org.ofbiz.stats\") for the Visit/Visitor/ServerHit* (and related) entities; for now the group is not active so that the entities are still in the same database as before; however assigning them to a different database is now a matter of uncommenting the group file definition in framework/webapp/ofbiz-component.xml and provide the new datasource definition"
