   "Replace more uses of UUID with NodeId. Most notably:", 
   "* Reference InternalValues now contain NodeIds instead of UUIDs", 
   "* Item state serializers use NodeIds instead of UUIDs", 
   "* Frozen ids in versioning are now NodeIds instead of UUIDs", 
   "* Dropped Session.internalGetUUID() in favor of Session.getNodeId()", 
   "* Dropped Session.getNodeByUUID(UUID) in favor of Session.getNodeById(NodeId)", 
   "None of these changes has functional effects, expect reducing the amount of extra NodeId objects that need to be instantiated when switching between representations."
