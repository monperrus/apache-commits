   "ButtonBase.as - Subclasses of ButtonBase were updating properties like selected and selection in the clickHandler. This caused the buttons to be in an intermediary state between the mouse up event and the mouse click event. I've added a new protected method called buttonReleased() that is called during the mouse up handler when the mouse is captured and when the mouse is hovering over the button. This allows the button to smoothly transition between states like down and overAndSelected without passing through the over state. I also separated out some of the systemManager mouse up handlers into a separate handler.",
