   "Here is Mike's review comments:", 
   "I have reviewed this patch and run a full set of tests on windows XP / sun jdk1.4.2 which passed. I think this patch should be committed as is. It is a good incremental checkin for this feature. It provides a set of tools for the rest of the project, and gets the code to the point that it can encrypt an existing unencrypted db. Future checkins should address a couple of things:", 
   "1) obviously more testing. Some quick notes, the current tests may want to show that accessing the newly encrypted db with a bad password does not work - just to insure all the url;s are not just being totally ignored. Also want to test abort - probably need a testing codepoint to cause the failure at the right time.", 
   "2) fix up the comments, there are some typo's .", 
   "3) usual nit - some greater than 80 char lines.", 
   "I would have committed this change now, but svn still is not back.",
