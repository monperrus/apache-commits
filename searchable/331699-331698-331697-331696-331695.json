   "- Now one can set addressing information directly via MEPClient (Call, InOnlyMEPClient, etc also inherit this). The much debated setReplyTo(epr) is enable, BUT the address of the replyTo epr will be overriden by the AxisEngine, which is fair enough. This will enable one to set reference parameters to the replyTo, so that he will receive them back, in the IN OUT scenario.", 
   "- Fixed a typo in CommonsHTTPTS.", 
   "Note : I know that the build is failing whilst running two of the security tests, due to a signature verification failure, at this moment. This might be due to the explicit default namespace serialization introduced yesterday. Will check with Ajith soon and will be fixed soon."
