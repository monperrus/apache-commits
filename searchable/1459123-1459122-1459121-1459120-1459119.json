   "[UIMA-2498] change strategy for where to hold \"previous\" values used in computing differences, for ints and feature structure refs.  This was motivated by the use case of type filtering type T2, and having a reference chain go thru the filtered type. A side benefit, now allow skipping of update of previous value when the value written is 0 - might (slightly) improve compression in some cases.",
