   "Minor: Addressed bug 1091897 by commenting and refactoring:", 
   "Added comments and refactored renderBody to the more illustrative name renderComponentTagBody.  Also changed names throughout the project to match this pattern.  Simplified renderComponentTag() by folding in stripComponentName() logic and removed overload of that method which advances the markup stream in addition to rendering the tag."
