   "Moved OMStAXWrapper from axiom-api to axiom-common-impl. From a packaging perspective this means that we go back to the pre-1.2.9 situation where LLOM and DOOM each had its own OMStAXWrapper class (source code duplication). The goal is to remove a class from axiom-api that must not be considered being part of the public API (as indicated in the Javadoc of OMContainer)."
