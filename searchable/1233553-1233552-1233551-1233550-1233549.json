   "Added OS.pm::create_currentimage_txt. This will be called by the libvirt capture subroutine and will eventually replace the code in utils.pm.", 
   "VCL-503", 
   "Updated OS.pm::execute_new. Added $identity_key argument.", 
   "VCL-553", 
   "Updated OS.pm::wait_for_reboot to accept the same arguments as the other wait_* subroutines: $total_wait_seconds, $attempt_delay_seconds, $attempt_limit. Updated reboot subroutines in Linux.pm and Windows.pm. Also added a $pre_configure argument to Windows.pm to allow the caller to control whether or not the pre-reboot safety tasks are done or if the computer is simply rebooted.",

   "Updated typo in Windows.pm::pre_capture. It wasn't calling disable_login_screensaver for VMs.", 
   "Other", 
   "Added check to Windows.pm::create_directory to check for '~' being passed as the argument. If this was the case, a /root/~ subdirectory was being created."
