   "- Modified the Scroller algorithm used in calculating the scrollAnchorPoint (the point where the scroll starts).  Now instead of using the mouseEvent coordinates where the threshold was crossed, we now calculate the threshold and use that instead.  In practice, a user probably wouldn't notice this much (unless there was a big delay between MouseMoves for some reason). However, this calculation is the right thing to do, and will help produce more consistent results with regards to QE and programatically faking the mouse events.",
