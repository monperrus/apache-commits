   "QPID-4109: Re-enable LoggingManagement MBean", 
   "* Re-wire up LoggingManagementMBean.", 
   "* Centralise log4j specific functionality into LoggingFacade class (moving implementation from LoggingManagementMBean and QpidLog4JConfigurator", 
   "together).", 
   "* Implement unit-tests for MBean and Facade levels.  Reenforce units tests with system tests testing logging management end to end.", 
   "* Changed QpidBrokerTestCase so that log4j.configuration is _always_ used to obtain the log4j config file regardless of whether test type", 
   "is spawned or internal (previously log4j.configuration was respected only for internal tests).  This was require to be able to", 
   "write a logging management system test that could safely change the contents of the log4j config without running the risk of", 
   "effecting other tests."
