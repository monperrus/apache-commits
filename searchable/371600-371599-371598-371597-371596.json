   "Fix for http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-1038 and http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-1039",

   "See http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=351812&view=rev", 
   "This change fixes the readOnly, loginRequired, rolesAllowed properties support. The annotation attributes for these properties can be set on both the Controller and the action annotations. With inheritance, we need to see if they are overridden by the derived Controller annotation.", 
   "There was also a bug in our logic for adding a new action config to the action mappings of the generated struts module config. For the delegating action model, we were not accounting for the form bean of the delegate when disambiguating the action path for overloaded action methods. In addition, we were using a copy constructor of the ActionModel when we disambiguated the DelegatingActionModel and therefor losing some properties that we needed to write to the action config.",
