   "Updated libvirt.pm. Added missing calls to insertloadlog. Fixed a few bugs with image capture. The code renames the image so that images are not inappropriately named vmware*. It was setting this updated name in the database but incorrectly naming image files saved to the datastore and repository. Updated code to name the files correctly.",
