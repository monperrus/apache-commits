   "Make ApplicationDispatcher thread safe. After a very long thread on the users list (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=116558790000003&r=1&w=2) this was found to be the root of the problem.", 
   "There was also some debate if this re-use of the RequestDispatcher was valid. The spec is not clear on this point.", 
   "This change should be functionality identical to the previous version. It uses additional local variables and method parameters rather than instance variables.", 
   "Some fields were unnecessary duplicates and have been removed."
