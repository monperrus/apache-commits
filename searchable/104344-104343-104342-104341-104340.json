   "Jars shouldn't derive from Apache::RequestRec.  This frees up their mg_ptr for more traditional uses, so we take advantage of that by adding a VALUE_CLASS argument to Apache::Cookie::Jar->new.  Setting this argument to a subclass of Apache::Cookie configures the jar's cookies() api to return values in this derived class, (instead of Apache::Cookie).  This should make the new freeze/thaw API for Apache::Cookie-derived classes considerably more useful.  Also Apache::Request cannot safely derive from APR::Pool class, so we only modify its base class in the mp2 case (Apache::RequestRec)."
