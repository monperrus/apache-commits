   "Remove the comparison between elliptical and spherical formulas from the assertions in the main code.", 
   "Instead, perform the comparison in the test suite with the help of ProjectionResultComparator.", 
   "The reason is that performing comparisons in the main code was very difficult because of approximations in formulas", 
   "(especially when using series expansion), for example in TransverseMercator for points far from the central meridian.", 
   "This resulted in either assertion failures because of too strict tolerance threshold, or not very useful assertions", 
   "because of too high tolerance threshold. By performing the comparisons in the test suite instead, we can control the", 
   "domain of the projected points, and choose the tolerance threshold accordingly."
