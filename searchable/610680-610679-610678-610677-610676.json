   "Resolved a bug in jar-based feature loading that was preventing resource loading. To load files as a resource from the java build, you now must pass in a text file with the resource names you wish to load. features.txt and core-features.txt facilitate this by including all currently existing features. This is NOT a requirement if you are using file-system based feature loading in the Java build."
