   "logic for detecting a conglomerate \"replacement\" scenario, and adds logic", 
   "to drop the old (shared) conglomerate in those scenarios. Also changes", 
   "the various ConstantAction classes which rely on the \"drop(...)\" methods", 
   "of ConglomerateDescriptor and ConstraintDescriptor so that they use the",
