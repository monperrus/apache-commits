   "As of this build, we have eliminated the need to sign JSPWiki JARs for 95% of most users' deployments. The only case where you need to sign them, now, is when you wish to create a JVM-wide, consolidated security policy. We have retained an Ant target \"signjar\" for that purpose. If you are upgrading from an earlier version of JSPWiki and are using a customized policy, however, you MUST MUST MUST remove any \"signedBy jspwiki\" and \"keystore\" references, otherwise JSPWiki might act odd."
