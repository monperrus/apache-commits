   "Modified LeastRecentlyAccessedEvictionStrategy to take a maximum number of page versions rather than a maximum number of pages.  Then added a call to the eviction strategy in Page.endVersion() and changed default of Settings.maxPageVersions to Integer.MAX_VALUE (no limit on page versions by default).  This gives us 15 page versions before versions start expiring during evictions.  If a page has only one version when an eviction is needed, the page will expire."
