   "Moving off of Plexus FileUtils and onto IO FileUtils. copyFileToDirectory in IO leads to the last-modified being maintained by default, which isn't desired in the case of src/test/java/org/apache/maven/archiva/proxy/ProxyRequestHandlerTest.java. I'll add a method to IO allowing that to be turned off (as copyFile(..) already has the variant) and this code can be simplified when IO 1.3 is released."
