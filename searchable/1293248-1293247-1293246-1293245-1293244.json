   "Modified the POST /widgets implementation so that widget packages are processed synchronously and return appropriate HTTP status codes and additional error information in the response body. This means that the REST API now has parity with the to-be-removed admin web interface. I also changed the test helpers to use this API rather than the admin web interface. See WOOKIE-318"
