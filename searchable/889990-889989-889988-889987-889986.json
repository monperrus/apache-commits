   "Refactored the PropertiesController to use the abstract Controller base class, implemented the delete method, and added a new suite of functional tests that checks calls to the Properties API. Implementing this required some small changes to Controller, and a new UnauthorizedAccessException class to flag authn issues. The core business methods of the PropertiesController are reused by WidgetAdminServlet and WidgetServiceServlet, and so these needed to be updated to reflect the changes."
