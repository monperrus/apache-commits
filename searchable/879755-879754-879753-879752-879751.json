   "Start fixing issue #2543 \"Inconsistent svn diff after rename\"", 
   "This commit changes the default output of 'svn diff'.", 
   "We now diff files which were locally added-with-history against an empty", 
   "file by default. The old behaviour (diffing the files against the copy", 
   "source) can be obtained by passing the --notice-ancestry flag to 'svn diff'.", 
   "There is a good reason to change the default. This will allow users to", 
   "easily create diffs that will re-apply almost as expected with 'svn patch'.", 
   "\"Almost\" because 'svn patch' currently has no way to represent copies since", 
   "it only understands plain unidiff, and since 'svn diff' only generates plain", 
   "unidiff. This will be improved later by adding support for git extensions", 
   "to the unidiff format to both 'svn diff' and 'svn patch', so they can", 
   "represent file copies.", 
   "More work is still needed to completely address issue #2543 and make", 
   "'svn diff' behave consistently in all cases.",
