   "Pretty basic refactoring for PARB (though it is a lot of files).  Renamed GestureCaptureEvent/GestureCaptureReason (these were previously TouchScrollEvent) to TouchInteractionEvent/TouchInteractionReason.  inputMode has been renamed to interactionMode and has a new enumeration class, mx.core.InteractionMode.", 
   "There's on non-PARB change that was made was in List and mobiletheme/defaults.css. I found a bug in that the item renderer wasn't highlighting on mousedown anymore. There were two issues at play. Firstly the touchDelay was set to 100 ms in the Scroller only, so I added it to List and added a FIXME comment to myself figuring out if the code in List should use scroller.getStyle(\"touchDelay\") or itemRenderer.getStyle(\"touchDelay\") instead of getStyle(\"touchDelay\"). Also, I found out that the code doesn't deal with touchDelay=0 very well. Since we're planning on working on this code anyways (and possibly moving it in to ItemRenderer itself with a new downstate), I just put in a hack with a FIXME to handle this case for now.",
