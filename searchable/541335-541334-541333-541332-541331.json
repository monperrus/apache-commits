   "DERBY-1816: ResultSet.getTime() on a SQL TIMESTAMP should retain millisecond", 
   "precision.  Patch does the following:", 
   "1. Separates the timestamp parse logic in client/am/DateTime.java into a new", 
   "method called \"parseTimestampString()\". The new method takes a timestamp", 
   "string and a Calendar object, and sets the fields of the Calendar based on", 
   "the fields that are parsed from the timestamp string.  The method also", 
   "returns the parsed microseconds value since that cannot be set on a", 
   "Calendar object (the precision of a Calendar is milliseconds).", 
   "2. Modifies timestampBytesToTimestamp(...) to call the new method for", 
   "parsing timestamps.", 
   "3. Changes the timestampBytesToTime(...) method so that it now parses the", 
   "full timestamp (via the new parseTimestampString() method) instead of", 
   "just parsing the hours, minutes, and seconds. Then a java.sql.Time", 
   "object is created from the Calendar object into which the timestamp", 
   "string was parsed. This allows us to preserve the sub-second resolution", 
   "that is parsed from the timestamp.", 
   "4. Re-enables the relevant test case in lang/TimeHandlingTest.java so that", 
   "it now runs in client mode."
