   "Rename of flex -> mx.", 
   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",

   "Couple of changes to Group and DataGroup:", 
   "1.  Got rid of content_changing, content_changed, dataProvider_changing, and dataProvider_changed events.  The events both group and datagroup emit are the item add and item remove events.  Fixed up Selector, DataComponent, and ItemsComponent to not key off of these events anymore.", 
   "2.  Clean up Group's canShareDisplayObject from the blendMode change", 
   "3.  Fix up DataGroup to deal with a case where a GraphicElement's itemRenderer's group was holding on to the display object.  When the graphic element was pushed into another itemRenderer, we tried to remove the graphic element's display object from its parent, but calling removeChild() on a Group RTE's.  We need to revisit the fix here, and possibly add methods for removing display objects to Group, or don't RTE in Group on removeChild/addChild, or add some code so itemRenderer's can clean themselves up afterwards...at any rate, this fix will be revisited.",

   "Here are some changes to DataGroup.", 
   "The big change is the way we instantiate components.  We aren\u2019t re-using the Group logic anymore.  This means there\u2019s no display object sharing going on, which reduces the complexity of the code.  It also treats renderers differently now.  Basically anytime a renderer is specified, it\u2019ll attempt to wrap you up in that renderer, even if you are a GraphicElement or a DisplayObject and may not need one.", 
   "There are some other changes, like changing an itemRenderer at runtime now works.  It\u2019s a bit heavy in what it invalidates right now, but I\u2019ll go back and revisit some of this logic.", 
   "Also, when no dataProvider is given, we don\u2019t automatically create one for the user.  This means I had to add some defense mechanisms where we were relying on the dataProvider, but doing a check for dataProvider != null was all that was really needed.",
