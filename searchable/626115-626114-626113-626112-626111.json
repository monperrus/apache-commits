   "Minor enhancement to WikiSession now allows full use of non-JSPWiki supplied JAAS LoginModules in the JSPWiki-custom configuration. Previously, we considered a user to be authenticated only if a LoginModule had added Role.AUTHENTICATED to the Subject's principal set. This is clearly unreasonable for LoginModules that have no knowledge of JSPWiki, such as Sun's supplied modules or third-party modules used for LDAP  authentication. Now, we consider a user authenticated if they are not anonymous and not asserted, and we lazily add Role.AUTHENTICATED in these cases, after login."
