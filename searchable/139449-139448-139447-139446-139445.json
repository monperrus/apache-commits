   "Solve the VMSVersioning problem a different way.  Created new subclass of VMSFTPEntryParser, VMSVersioningFTPEntryParser, and rollback many other changes of the last few days which no longer were necessary.  This implementation is a much simpler solution to this problem and will allow for the smooth removal of the deprecated FTPFileListParser interface in 2.0."
