   "OPENEJB-1018: Support for exposing a single interface as @WebService, @Remote, and @Local", 
   "Another step in the right direction.  Split the internal openejb/ejb/ tree into two trees: openejb/local and openejb/remote.  One is for the LocalInitialContextFactory and the other is for the RemoteInitialContextFactory.  The business local and local home interfaces are not bound into the openejb/remote tree.  The result is that if someone uses the same interface as the remote and local business interface the LocalInitialContextFactory will always give you the local view and the RemoteInitalContextFactory will always give you the remote view."
