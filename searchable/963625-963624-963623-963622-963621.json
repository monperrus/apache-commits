   "TUSCANY-3616 - Add code to check that that interface contracts a reference and reference binding and at service and service binding match. Motivated by BWS_2007. TO do this properly we have to test that the interfaces are described using the same IDL and if not convert to WSDL1.1 are required by the SCA specifications. There are a lot of changes here as doing this upset quite a few tests. Further work is required to look at the details of our WSDL generation process which looks a little suspect around wrapper namespaces."
