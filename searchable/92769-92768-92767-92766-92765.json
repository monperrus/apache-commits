   "This small patch modifies the log's to use plog instead of pconf.", 
   "Basically pconf is cleared at different times from plog, and this", 
   "has the effect of leaving stderr closed when going into the next", 
   "stage of the config. This also had the effect of allowing FreeBSD", 
   "with threads to create a pipe with stderr's fd at one end, and this", 
   "resulted in problems with the signal polling and high cpu usage.", 
   "In addition, move the clearing of plog from main.c to core.c where", 
   "it seems more appropriate.", 
   "This solves the first and main problem that FreeBSD has with the", 
   "threaded MPM's."
