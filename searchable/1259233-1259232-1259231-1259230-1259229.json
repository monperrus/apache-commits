   "Fix for http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-26267. Embedded assets were depending on AdvancedLayoutFeatures and other framework classes. This caused a simple AS-only swf size to be quite large, and even fail to build in an AS-only project in FB. The fixes are:", 
   "-Softlink FlexVersion using hasDefinition/getDefinition. This gets rid of the dependency on the ResourceManager, which fixes the compile error in FB.", 
   "-Introduce a new interface, IAssetLayoutFeatures, which contains a subset of the API from AdvancedLayoutFeatures only used by the asset classes. AdvancedLayoutFeatures implements this interface. The interface also removes the API dependency on TransformOffsets.", 
   "-We can then softlink AdvancedLayoutFeatures and MatrixUtil to remove that dependency.", 
   "-Use the hardcoded string \"ltr\" instead of the constant LayoutDirection.LTR to remove the dependency on LayoutDirection.",
