   "A variety of modifications:  Updated template files and portlet.xml to reflect excluded test usage.  I.e. portlet.xml and templates now include the excluded tests which are latter ignored because of the reference in the excluded file list.  Also as the renderPolicy tests are excluded I modified the root pom to not build/run the renderPolicy apps avoiding extra processing. Finallt, I removed the BridgeClassDefaultTestPortlet.java file from Chapter 4 as this test was never completed/included."
