   "Beta bug: After scrolling around a list, view transitions would become chunky.  The reason for this is we were sometimes calling pause() to end an animation (when someone started scrolling before the fade scrollbar effect finished) and never resuming it, so there was a lot of overhead in keeping the animation paused.  Instead we should be calling stop().  Because of this, we now need to distinguish between an EFFECT_END caused by us calling stop() versus one that naturally occurs.",

   "- Modified the Scroller algorithm used in calculating the scrollAnchorPoint (the point where the scroll starts).  Now instead of using the mouseEvent coordinates where the threshold was crossed, we now calculate the threshold and use that instead.  In practice, a user probably wouldn't notice this much (unless there was a big delay between MouseMoves for some reason). However, this calculation is the right thing to do, and will help produce more consistent results with regards to QE and programatically faking the mouse events.",
