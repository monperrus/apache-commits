   "remove start and end hashing from LocalVariableGen's hashCode, as these values are changed after this LocalVariableGen is added to a HashMap. Change hashCode to be based on index, name and type. These means the problem still occurs if a change is made to the name or type. But this 'might' happen, as opposed to start/end absolutely happening. -- A real fix should be developed in the future."
