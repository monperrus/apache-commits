   "* Changed MesosSchedulerDriver to take a FrameworkInfo instead of a", 
   "name and possibly FrameworkID. This required adding an optional", 
   "FrameworkID to FrameworkInfo. The hope is that with this change can", 
   "more easily update the FrameworkInfo semantics without requiring", 
   "recompilation. For example, as we add better support for auth", 
   "entication we should hopefully be able to do that directly in", 
   "FrameworkInfo. We also simplified the C++ MesosSchedulerDriver by", 
   "removing unused constructors (that also don't have versions in", 
   "either Java or Python).", 
   "* Renamed the 'url' parameter of MesosSchedulerDriver to 'master' and", 
   "updated the allowable schemes of 'master' to include a host:port", 
   "pair (we internally add 'mas ter@') and replaced zoo:// with zk://", 
   "and zoofile:// with file:// (but with different semantics, see the", 
   "documentation). We also changed the master webui to show t he", 
   "host:port and removed the PID and updated and added tests related to", 
   "creating MasterDetectors from the above schemes.", 
   "* Replaced the --url argument of mesos-master with --zk argument for", 
   "clarity.", 
   "* Removed 'code' from the Scheduler/Executor::error callback since it", 
   "was not being used (nor did it seem useful in the future).", 
   "* Made some naming consistency changes across the C++, Java, and", 
   "Python interfaces (sched -> scheduler, exec -> executor, etc)."
