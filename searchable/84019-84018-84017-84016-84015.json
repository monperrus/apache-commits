   "Apache for Windows can get caught in a tight loop whild handling CGI requests. Here's how:", 
   "sendwithtimeout() sets  errno to EINTR on a timeout and returns SOCKET_ERROR (-1) to", 
   "the caller. The caller reissues sendwithtimeout, which then succeeds. errno is left set to", 
   "EINTR. Eventually,  another read is attempted on one of the CGI pipes (ap_bgets in mod_cgi,", 
   "or ap_send_fb_length) which goes down into ap_read. ap_read issues a Win32 ReadFile to read", 
   "from the pipe. If this read fails, it returns -1 to the caller. If errno", 
   "is still set to EINTR, the caller will retry the read and so the loop begins.", 
   "The solution is quite simple. buff.c relies heavily on errno. Anytime Win32 calls are used", 
   "in code that uses errno, we need to always, ALWAYS explicitly set errno when a Win32 system", 
   "call fails (via either errno = GetLastError() or errno = WSAGetLastError()). Since Win32", 
   "does not use EINTR, this problem should not occur.",
