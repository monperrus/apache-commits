   "- Freed FlowController (base class for PageFlowController/SharedFlowController/GlobalApp) from its subclassing of the Struts Action base class.  This has been on the plate for a while -- page flows themselves do not need to be actions, despite their superficial similarity to DispatchActions.  This lays the groundwork for a PageFlowManagedObject base class, which will support Control instantiation, lifecycle methods, and persistance for page flows, shared flows, and JSF backing objects.", 
   "- Fixed Shared Flow (and Global.app) actions to be run correctly when invoked from a JSP that does not live in a directory with a page flow.", 
   "- Fixed an NPE that occurred when compiling a file with a @Jpf.FormBean annotation.", 
   "- Fixed an assertion error when compiling a .jpf with a @Jpf.ValidatableBean annotation.", 
   "- Fixed the search order for invoking an overloaded action from a JSP.  When there are two choices for the action, we choose the one whose fully-qualified form bean classname comes first.",
