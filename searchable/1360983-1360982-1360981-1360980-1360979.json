   "Modified StAXSOAPModelBuilder such that the approach it uses to create the SOAPMessage is compatible with the way StAX(OM)Builder creates the OMDocument. This allows us to simplify some of the more obscure parts of StAXSOAPModelBuilder. Other side effects of the change are:", 
   "* The SOAPEnvelope is now created lazily.", 
   "* Comments in the XML prolog of a SOAP message are no longer dropped.", 
   "Note that the change is not trivial because it implies that the SOAPMessage implementation must be able to get the SOAPFactory lazily from the builder (because it is only known after the SOAPEnvelope has been instantiated).  A test case covers this scenario."
