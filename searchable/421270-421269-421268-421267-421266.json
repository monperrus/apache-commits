   "1. Changed the unwrapping algorithm to generate the types as anonymous inner types rather than names top level types.", 
   "2. Changed the implementation of unwrapping to have a different architecture.", 
   "I. Now the unwrapping happens using the objects rather than the XML. The approach with OM (the previous implementation) had the drawback of the complete tree being built.", 
   "II. Slightly Changed the structure of the intermediate XML format. Changed the templates to suit the change of the XML format."
