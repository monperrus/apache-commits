It requires Java 1.5 to build and is not integrated with the build scripts for branched/3.0.x; this branch continues to have a prebuilt asc.jar in 'lib'.",

   "Fix ASC bug where the code for named, nested functions was incorrect - the bug was that the function could not recursively call itself, as the code to make the function visible to itself was not being emitted.  This was broken by an optimization to null out the FunctionBuilder for a method after we codegen'ed the method - but, the FunctionBuilder contained data that was needed after it was nulled out.  Moved the flag from the FunctionBuilder to the FunctionCommonNode so we know we always have it.",
