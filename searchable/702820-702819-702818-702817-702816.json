   "Rewrite of the social api layer: cleaned up classes and abstractions, made function params consistent with java's spi, rewrote all spi error notification from returning response items to exceptions, rewrote all return types to plain vars and arrays; And got the amount of 0.7 test suite errors down from 26 to aprox 8 (0.8 test suite errors are work in progress, currently on 16). Warning: use the updated partuza data services to test, the build in jsob-db sample is known-to-be-broken"
