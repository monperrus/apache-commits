   "Grid layers are now defined as type GridLayer (a private class), instead of Group.", 
   "GridLayer type no longer extends Group, it's now an object that has Group valued root property.   This makes the type's API relatively tiny - only two methods - and makes it possible for GridLayer to encapsulate the Grid itself as a layer (the item renderer layer).", 
   "Grid item renders are now consistently typed as IGridItemRenderer, rather than IVisualElement.", 
   "DefaultGridItemRenderer is now a UIFTETextField subclass and no longer supports the \"textFieldClass\" style.  A new UITextField based item renderer has been added, it's UITextFieldGridItemRenderer.", 
   "Support for the module implications of embedded fonts is now GridColumn's responsiblity.  GridColumn/itemToRenderer() now wraps item renderer ClassFactory item renders with a local ClassFactory subclass that delegates the newInstance() operation to the grid's moduleFactory.",
