   "I fixed an, unrelated to patch, problem in EditProductContentContent.groovy. This is not the 1st time I cross this type of issue. I checked it does not appear on demo server and I guess it was not appearing with bsh  before. I'm not sure of its origin but it seems related to my configuration. I use, from my machine default, \"Central European Summer Time\" and demo server uses \"Central Daylight Time\". But I can't see why it affects my machine and not the demo server : there is no origin here (maybe GMT, but obviously it's not the case)",
