   "- When an inorder RM system is under load msgs aren't always being delivered to applications as the InvokerWorker currently working the seq has the lock on the seq but has decided that there are no more msgs to process as the SequenceProcessor thread hasn't quite got as far as inserting a new InvokerBean.  This means neither thread does the work of delivering the msg to the application.  The fix is to move the removing of the lock on the sequence to before we commit the tran used to find the InvokerBean in the InvokerWorker."
