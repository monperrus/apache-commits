   "Implement GUMP-146, by creating a custom rsync-like implementation of sync functionality which is tailored to gump its needs. Considerably simpler than sync.py from gump2, considerably more efficient, and more aligned with the needs of the last-continuous-build functionality from GUMP-105. Again, since this is code heavy on 'side effects' and low on actual logic, most of it is tested through the integration test and not through unit tests. Shame on me. But it is cool stuff otherwise..."
