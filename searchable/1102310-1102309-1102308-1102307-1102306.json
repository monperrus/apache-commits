   "CLEREZZA-509: pingback protocol. A lot of it had been implemented previously. But now it's at the stage where I can send a ping to someone. to test it, enter someone's URI eg http://fcns.eu/people/andrei/card#me (he has a pingback endpoint) in the profile panel person viewer, add him to your friends, then you can click the \"ping\" link next to his image that will appear on your profile. You will arive on a form where you need to enter your webid and his and a message you can send him. If these are chosen carefully it will work.... Well the fields should be filled in autoamtically, and a picture of the person you are to ping should appear there too..."
