   "LOGCXX-430: My patch didn't work, against my expactations I seem to have introduced \"static initialization order fiasco\", which the former implementation didn't suffer from. So I changed the problem of not beeing thread safe with another one and I was surely only lucky in my former runs of the testsuite to succeed. Currently they don't, so I'll revert my changes and reopen the issue again."
