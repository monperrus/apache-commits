   "1. Adding  a comment about redefine handling", 
   "This seems to be an issue we need to discuss in the mailing list. I'm thinking that the behavior of the schema object model should not be validating and if the redefine is missing the parent then the object model should not be generating faults. However it would be convenient (just as in the case of getElement/Type) to have at least some utility methods that allows one to search through the full import/include/redefine hierarchy."
