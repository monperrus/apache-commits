   "add the ability to decorate all IHeaderResponses created by Wicket.", 
   "This gives you a convenient place to wrap an IHeaderResponse in a separate implementation", 
   "that incrementally adds functionality.  Examples of functionality that can be added:", 
   "1 - you could wrap all calls to renderJavascriptReference and catch any JS reference that is", 
   "added to the header response, and see if those resource references (externally, in some", 
   "ancillary configuration service) are dependent on other resource references.  Then, you can", 
   "add the original reference and all dependent references to the real header response that", 
   "you are delegating to.", 
   "2 - you also could wrap all calls that append javascript and cache them rather than immediately", 
   "writing them out, and then write them in the footer instead of the header, without having to", 
   "add a new notion of IFooterListener or similar", 
   "NOTE: these functionalities are NOT part of this commit (and likely wouldn't go in core).  This", 
   "commit is simply about adding a hook that makes it possible for you to do these thing."
