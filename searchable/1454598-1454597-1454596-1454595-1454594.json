   "[UIMA-2498] added many tests for serializing/deserializing, with and without \"delta\", with a variety of different scenarios of non-matching type systems.  Got those test to flush out a bunch of bugs.  At this point, the tests I have pass. Some of the fixes were to the \"CAS Compare\" method; this now only compares \"reachable\" Feature Structures, and skips comparing types that are only in one of the CASes, or features of types that are only in 1 of the CASes."
