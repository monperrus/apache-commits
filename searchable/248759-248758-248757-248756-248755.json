   "Fix for Bug# 15752.  TypeEntry QName for elements below anonymous elements were being assigned a QName that did not match the QName associated with deserialized elements.  The two lines modified have been in place since the file was created, but this change does not break any functional tests.", 
   "Phase II is to check in a test case that exposes the bugfix.  The test relies on a .NET based service and wsdl definition.  Also, an example of how to deserialize the contents of a strongly typed .NET dataset will be demonstrated."
