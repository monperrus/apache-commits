   "Replace the old JavaScript query server JSON library with json2.js", 
   "This change makes us interoperate better with other JSON implementations. It also means we can use the native JSON handlers in JavaScript runtimes that support them. Should be faster right away on new Spidermonkeys.", 
   "There are some potential breaking changes for apps that depend on Couch blowing up on 'undefined'. json2.js serialized undefined as 'null' instead of crashing.", 
   "This change will also affect people using E4X, as you can't just return an XML object and have it serialized to a string for you. Calling .toXMLString() on these is all you need to do."
