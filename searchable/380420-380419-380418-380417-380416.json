   "change the forkmode junit to once rather than running them in the maven process.  this exposed an initialization bug in the xbean parser where custom editors were being registered in the xbean:generate goal and the tests depended on that.  also change the xbean:generate goal to a post goal so the test classes are compile before running the generator so you don't see warnings on a clean build."
