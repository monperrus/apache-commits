   "THRIFT-894. java: Make default accessors for binary fields return byte[]; provide new accessors to get ByteBuffer version", 
   "This patch causes the underlying ByteBuffer that backs a binary field to be hidden behind a default accessor that provides a byte[] interface. This should allow users who skipped 0.4 to update their generated code without breaking any of their other code. A new accessor has been added that allows a way down to the underlying ByteBuffer for those experts who want to take advantage."
