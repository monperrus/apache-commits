   "Fixed bug in WebContainerAuthorizer introduced by change to Java Servlet API 2.4. The parsing class now explictly includes namespaces in XPath searches. This was not something we needed to worry about with 2.3 (which used a DTD). The result of this problem was causing container-managed logins to fail."

   "Major enhancement: replaced JSPWiki's dependency on the global, JVM-wide security policy with a \"local policy\" that is always read from WEB-INF/jspwiki.policy. If you have a JVM-wide policy, the local policy will supplement it. The practical upshot of this change is that the most common configuration challenge that most first-time admins face (why won't any pages display?) is gone, and gone forever. No more fiddling with the java.security.policy property! The syntax for the local policy is exactly the same as what it's always been; but now it Just Works instead of Mostly Works."
