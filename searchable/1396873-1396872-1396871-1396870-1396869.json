   "Fixed a deadlock and some CT failures.", 
   "A deadlock existed between org.eclipse.osgi.internal.resolver.StateImpl.monitor and org.apache.aries.subsystem.core.Activator. It occurred when one thread was initializing the root subsystem, had a lock on the Activator, and needed a lock on the monitor as part of installing the region context bundle. Another thread was loading a class with dynamic imports, kicked off a resolution that grabbed the monitor lock, and ended up calling the SubsystemResolverHook which needed a lock on the Activator. The fix was to remove the need for the Activator lock in the SubsystemResolverHook.",
