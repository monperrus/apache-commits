   "PR #29874 (Auto method retrial broken)", 
   "Changelog:", 
   "* fixes broken 'request sent' logic, albeit at the expense of adding (yet another) method to the HttpMethod interface", 
   "* deprecates HttpRecoverableException, MethodRetryHandler, DefaultMethodRetryHandler classes, HttpMethodBase#setMethodRetryHandler and HttpMethodBase#getMethodRetryHandler methods", 
   "* adds new HttpMethodRetryHandler interface that acts on plain IOExceptions", 
   "* eliminates superfluous HttpTimeoutException & IOTimeoutException classes", 
   "* ConnectTimeoutException now subclasses the standard InterruptedIOException, which is more consistent with the overall Java exception handling framework", 
   "* HttpConnectionManager classes now throw a more specific ConnectionPoolTimeoutException derived from ConnectTimeoutException. There can be cases when socket connect timeout needs to be differentiated from that of the connection pool",
