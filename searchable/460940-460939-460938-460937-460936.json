   "Added interpolate abstract method to TextTemplate to support a shared resource factory and link class.  Added a TextTemplateSharedResourceFactory class which makes it very easy to create unique shared resource references for various interpolations of a template.  Also added a link class that uses the factory to create links to resources generated by the factory."
