   "Fix for TUSCANY-1276, added XMLSchemas for Tuscany bindings and implementation types, fixed a few XSD bugs causing schema ambiguities, fixed ValidatingXMLStreamReader to handle getElementText() correctly, fixed some composite files to make them comply with the SCA schemas, and added test methods to test XMLSchema validation. XMLSchema validation problems are logged as warnings, indicating the file, line and column of the problem. This should greatly improve the error reporting when loading .composite, .componentType and .constrainingType files."
