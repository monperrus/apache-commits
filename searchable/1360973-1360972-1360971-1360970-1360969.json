   "Removed a test case for a scenario (wrong SOAP envelope namespace) that is already covered elsewhere (see BadInputTest/wrongSoapNs.xml).", 
   "This also solves the problem that the test case incorrectly asserts that the SOAPProcessingException is thrown by createSOAPModelBuilder: the Axiom implementation may choose to parse the SOAP envelope lazily and the exception will only occur when the envelope is requested."
