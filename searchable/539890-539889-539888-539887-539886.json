   "Fix for BEANUTILS-243 - BeanUtils fails to compile under 1.6 - thanks to Henri Yandell", 
   "Changes in the ResultSet and ResultSetMetaData for JDK 1.6 meant that BeanUtils tests no longer compiled. However implementing the methods would prevent it from compiling under earlier JDK versions. To resolve this the mock implementations have been converted to implement InvocationHandler (rather than ResultSet/ResultSetMetaData) and factory methods provided to create proxies. This tests now compile and run successfully (tests on JDK 1.3.1_18, JDK 1.5.0_07 and JDK 1.6.0"
