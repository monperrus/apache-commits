   "Various changes to obscure Spark text styles.", 
   "The default for the 'dominantBaseline' style, as set in the global selector, is now \"auto\", as it is now in TLF, instead of \"roman\". In TLF, a value of \"auto\" means \"ideographicCenter\" if the 'locale' is Japanese (i.e., starts with \"ja\") or Chinese (i.e., starts with \"zh\"), and \"roman\" otherwise. SimpleText now implements this same logic.", 
   "The default for the 'firstBaselineOffset' style, as set in the global selector, is now \"auto\", as it is now in TLF, instead of \"ascent\". SimpleText does not support 'firstBaselineOffset'.", 
   "The default for the 'justificationRule' style, as set in the global selector, is now \"auto\" as it is now in TLF, instead of \"space\". In TLF, a value of \"auto\" means \"eastAsian\" if the 'locale' is Japanese or Chinese, and \"space\" otherwise. SimpleText now implements this same logic.", 
   "The default for the 'justificationStyle' style, as set in the global selector, is now \"auto\", as it is now in TLF, instead of \"pushInKinsoku\". In TLF, a value of \"auto\" means \"pushInKinsoku\" regardless of the locale. (I guess \"auto\" just sounds like a nicer default.) SimpleText now implements this same logic.", 
   "The default for the 'tabStops' style, as set in the global selector, is now null. Previously it was omitted from the global selector and the default value was therefore undefined.", 
   "The 'tracking' style has been removed. (The 'trackingLeft' and 'trackingRight' styles remain.) A 'tracking' attribute was defined in FXG 1.0 but FTE instead implemented trackingLeft and trackingRight properties. So when compiling FXG 1.0, the compiler will (soon) map 'tracking' to 'trackingRight', and 'tracking' will not be supported in MXML. SimpleText no longer pays any attention to a 'tracking' style.", 
   "The 'leadingModel' style can now be set to \"ascentDescentUp\", as in TLF. The default remains \"auto\".", 
   "The metadata for the 'backgroundAlpha' style in TextGraphicElement and RichEditableText no longer says theme=\"halo\".", 
   "I also fixed some [Event] metadata and @eventType comments in RichEditableText.", 
   "Finally, RichEditableText now has an mx_internal createTextContainerManager() method. You can override this if you need to subclass our RichEditableTextContainerManager.", 
   "QE Notes: Some tests may need updating due to these changes.",

Since text input has multiline=false it doesn't make sense for it to be anything other than one line.  And if another component reskins TextInput they shouldn't have to know to set it to 1.",
