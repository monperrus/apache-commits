   "COCOON-2115: Implemented evaluation of sitemap expressions by using StringTemplateParser interface:",

   "* implemented LegacySubstitutions that extend Substitutions class and supports special handling of LegacySitemapStringTemplateParser class. It was needed because sitemap has concepts (like InvocationContext) that are not present in cocoon-expression-language-api module.", 
   "* implemented StringTemplateParserVariableResolver class that allows to use StringTemplateParser as VariableResolver in sitemap. It's general purpose bridge so you can use any class implementing StringTemplateParser interface.",
