   "VCL-870 - the foreign keys are not in sync between the vcl.sql and update-vcl.sql files", 
   "The idea with these changes is to allow innocuous changes to cascade, but to restrict changes that could be a problem. Updates to id fields for most tables are allowed to cascade. It is unlikely that someone would need to change the id of most entries, but changing them should not be a problem were someone to do it. However, changes to id fields for resources are not allowed because those changes cannot be cascaded to resource.subid. In those cases, updates to the ids are restricted. Additionally, cascading deletes are not allowed for fields where records should never be deleted. These would include (but not be limited to) entries in the user, computer, image, managmentnode, and log tables. Schedules are allowed to be deleted. So schedule deletes can be cascaded.",
