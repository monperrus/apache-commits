   "Exclude JDBC test if JDK < 1.4 (HSQLDB 1.7.2 uses classes introduced in JDK 1.4)", 
   "I upgraded the HSQLDB version from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2 because of the change I made to JDBCResources to close the Connection properly (HSQLDB < 1.7.2 shuts down the database when all connections are closed) caused the JDBCResources test case to fail! However now the tests fail under JDK 1.3, so I've added a test to not run if pre JDK 1.4."
