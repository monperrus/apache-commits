   "[MRESOURCES-79] Adding parameter 'extraFilters' to allow users to configure resources mojo separately from testResources mojo using default-resources and default-testResources executionIds (starting in Maven 2.2.0). The build/filters section of the POM will be used as 'global' filters, and the extraFilters parameter is added in FRONT of the build/filters entries (extraFilters have the opportunity to override filters from the build section of the POM)."

This can be simplified if the flag is passed through the resources execution instance, but that will require a new release of maven-filtering.",
