   "Minor fixes to bring up tutorial/nodes-jee/catalog-webapp. Look for runtime JARs in lib/ in addition to modules/. Use local copies of contribution JARs in a WAR if available. Use the correct classloader to load the NodeImplFactory in a webapp environment. Packaged the necessary JARs in the tutorial sample catalog webapp and fixed the call to a local version of the catalog service in the JSP."
