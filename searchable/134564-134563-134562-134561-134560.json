   "PR #28322 (Connection timeout logic redesign)", 
   "Changelog:", 
   "* CreateSocket method with timeout parameter added to the ProtocolSocketFactory", 
   "interface", 
   "* TimeoutController related code factored out of HttpConnection class and moved", 
   "into ControllerThreadSocketFactory helper class", 
   "* ReflectionSocketFactory helper class added. This factory encapsulates", 
   "reflection code to call JDK 1.4 Socket#connect method if supported", 
   "* All protocol socket factories now attempt to initially use", 
   "ReflectionSocketFactory if required to create a socket within a given limit of", 
   "time. If reflection fails protocol socket factories fall back onto the good ol'", 
   "ControllerThreadSocketFactory", 
   "Benefits:", 
   "* HttpConnection code got a lot cleaner", 
   "* When running in modern JREs expensive timeout controller thread per connection", 
   "attempt is no longer needed", 
   "* Ugly code intended to work around limitations of the older JREs is now", 
   "confined to a few helper classes that can be easily thrown away once we move", 
   "onto Java 1.4",
