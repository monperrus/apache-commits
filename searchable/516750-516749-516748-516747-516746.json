   "OPENJPA-35: fixed bulk update / bulk delete logic to properly clear out the data cache as well as the query cache. We could probably change the logic to remove the query cache mutations, since the data cache clear should automatically clear out the query cache as needed. Also changed the test framework a bit to allow for easier test harness creation without using SingleEMTest, which required providing access to the open brokers from AbstractBrokerFactory."
