   "This is just one of numerous mistakes anyone can make.  The validation process will help catch as many of them as possible before they enter the container system and cause obscure error.", 
   "A bit of preventative medicine, so to speak.", 
   "The validation can be done at any time we like.  For now, I recommend it take place at the beginning of the deploy process on the deploy tool.  I do not recommend putting validation in the ConfigurationFactory as this would seriously slow the startup of the container."
