   "Implemented polymorphic block inheritance. For the moment one have to call the super block explicitly through block:super:, don't know if this is ok or if we should have implicit sitemap inheritance. Also removed BlockManager.getServiceManager(), no need for it ATM, there will always be a TreeProcessor at the processor stack in cases when the current serviceManager could be needed."
