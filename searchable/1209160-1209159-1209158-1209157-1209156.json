   "* Major simplification of the exception handling API and a complete rewrite of the exception handling code in the async protocol handlers; this also required deprecation of NHttpClientHandler and NHttpServiceHandler interfaces superseded by NHttpClientProtocolHandler and NHttpServerProtocolHandler interfaces; the new interfaces are largely identical to old ones, however, unlike the old interfaces methods of new interfaces throw IOException and HttpException to the caller relieving the handles from having to handle those exceptions in each and every method; This change was largely inspired by HTTPCORE-283.",
