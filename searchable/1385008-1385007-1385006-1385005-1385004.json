   "Bug fix. When creating Sales Order priority of Order is set to Medium i.e 2 in OrderHeader. But when reserving inventory of sales order  priority is not set in OrderItemShipGrpInvRes . This results placing Order to get last priority even if its ship before date is of earliest date. So this fix will solve the bug and Orders will get reservation priority as expected.", 
   "Thanks Divesh for the contribution."
