   "Fixed an astoundingly brain-damaged bug in WikiContext that caused all wiki contexts to use the default template in all cases, regardless of the setting in jspwiki.properties. This bug was introduced by the 2.4.25 security mega-patch. The fix, of course, was three lines of code. Now that it's in, I'd like to put down my crack pipe long enough to thank Terry Steichen for spotting this."
