   "o added loader class for schema class loading", 
   "o remove loading methods from the BootstrapSchema", 
   "o remove loading implementation form AbstractBootstrapSchema as well", 
   "o removed OidRegistry from MatchingRuleFactory method signatures since the", 
   "OidRegistry is automatically updated by all registries and they also", 
   "automatically resolve names as well as numeric OIDs", 
   "o implemented load functionality for normalizers, comparators, syntaxCheckers,",

   "Notes ...", 
   "o figured out how things are finally going to work out with plugin", 
   "- plugin generates factories and BootstrapSchema implementations", 
   "- if plugin finds a default implementation for a factory in the", 
   "org.apache.eve.schema.bootstrap package then it uses that",

   "one at a time", 
   "o by default a bunch of schemas will automatically get loaded",

   "Conclusions ...", 
   "o this two phase scheme of generating code and storing schema object", 
   "configurations in Java classes eliminates the need to store xxxxx.schema",

   "o it also makes bootstrap loading and registry population much simpler since", 
   "it is broken down into separate tasks by function within various phases", 
   "o Java configuration class file loading is very fast since all Strings are", 
   "are compiled and the code is hard coded as opposed to being dynamic"
