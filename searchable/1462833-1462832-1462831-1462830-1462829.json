   "[HBASE-8223] Fixes race condition between append and close in HLog", 
   "Author: rshroff", 
   "Summary:", 
   "The RegionServer was performing a shutdown as it got", 
   "YouAreDeadException. It closed the HLog and was waiting to close all the", 
   "regions where it got stuck.", 
   "The reason region close is stuck because it's trying to obtain a lock", 
   "which is occupied by the put op, which in turn is waiting for append to", 
   "HLog to complete.", 
   "There is race condition here is between append/sync and HLog.close()", 
   "work flow.", 
   "Scenario:", 
   "Thread 1 => doing the append", 
   "Thread 2 => doing HregionServer shutdown", 
   "Timeline:", 
   "t1> 1: Verifies that LogSyncer is not shutting down and HLog is not", 
   "closed and calls sync()", 
   "t2> 2: HRegionServer issued HLog.close()", 
   "t3> 2: In HLog.close(), it joins the LogSyncer thread, which signals all", 
   "the threads waiting on syncDone and exits.", 
   "t4> 1: In sync, it sees that the sync has not complete until its txd,", 
   "hence adds itself to the syncDone.await queue.", 
   "Note: at t4, it does not check whether the LogSyncer Thread is alive or", 
   "not, which caused this hang.", 
   "The fix is to check whether the LogSyncer thread is closing or not", 
   "before going to await for the sync to finish.",
