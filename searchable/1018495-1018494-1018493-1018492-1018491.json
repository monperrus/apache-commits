   "Added Specification#getInstance() and NakedObject#getInstance(Specification<S> s) to allow double-dispatch design for the derivation of Instance<S> for a given NakedObject/Specification (eg a NakedObjectAction); in turn this requires Specification to be generic, parameterized by itself; PojoAdapter throws UnsupportedOperationException, but PojoAdapterX (in nof-core-x) provides an implementation."

   "Renamed NakedObjectSpecification#getProperties (and #getProperty) to the more generic #getAssociations (and #getAssociation).  Have then added new #getProperties and #getCollections which are typesafe (return OTOA or OTMA rather than just NakedObjectAssociation).  Also renamed PropertyContainer interface to AssociationContainer.  Also added *List methods to the interface (eg #getPropertyList as well as #getProperties).  For ActionContainer, also added *List methods (#getObjectActionList as well as #getObjectActions)."
