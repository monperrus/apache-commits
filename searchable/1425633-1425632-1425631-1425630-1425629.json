   "Allow multiple threads to process an upgraded connection at the same time.", 
   "This is required to support blocking reads/writes. The Servlet[Input|Output]Streams do not expose an API for a blocking [read|write]. Therefore to block a thread has to wait until [onDataAvailable()|onWritePossible()] is called. The problem is that the waiting thread holds a lock on the socket and there is no way through the Servlet 3.1 API to release that lock. Until the lock is released the thread that will eventually call [onDataAvailable()|onWritePossible()] is blocked. So a form of deadlock occurs. To overcome this without requiring libraries such as WebSocket implementations to access container specific APIs, Tomcat has to allow multiple threads to process a upgraded connection at the same time."
