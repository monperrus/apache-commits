   "- org/apache/derby/iapi/tools/i18n/LocalizedInput.java -", 
   "Performance of ij tests improved by using a BufferedReader on top of the", 
   "InputStreamReader when ij read from its scriptfiles.", 
   "The reason is the use of some buffers when doing character conversion.", 
   "Every time the buffer is full, an exception object would be created, thrown and caught; for instance, during LangScripts test, when ij read 1 char at a time from the InputStream, this would happen 1.5 million times. Using the BufferedReader reduced the number of exceptions to 92, and made the test run a lot faster on this platform.", 
   "- GrantRevokeTest - clean up code was added (on phoneME advanced tests run in opposite order. )", 
   "- CollationTest.java and CollationTest2.java - Added code to not run the tests for non-english locales if the locales are not supported", 
   "- ForBitDataTest.java - clean up code was added", 
   "- ScrollCursors1Test.java - clean up code was added", 
   "- ForUpdateTest.java - Moved code from a test to general setup as it was needed by more than one test and thus fixtures were not independent of order.", 
   "- UpdateCursorTest.java - clean up code was added", 
   "- upgradeTests/_Suite.java - added code to prevent upgrade from 10.3.1.4", 
   "because 10.3.1.4 doesn't boot on this platform (DERBY-3176).", 
   "- BaseJDBCTestCase - added method to compare Time objects",
