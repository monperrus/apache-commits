To be able to fix gump errors further down the dependency tree (ie cocoon deps on avalon and stuff like that), I am temporarily breaking the \"continuous integration\" cycle by having excalibur depend on a specific version of altrmi. It is not possible to depend on a specific branch or tag for altrmi as none exist."
