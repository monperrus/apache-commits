   "Implemented the basic changes that are needed support other kind of webapplications, such as portlets. The main change in this is that WebRequest is now abstract, and that in a servlet environment ServletWebRequest is the concrete implementation. The changes are mostly internals; the only break (actually for clients that depended on internals anyway) is that instead of doing: javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest httpRequest = ((WebRequest) cycle.getRequest()).getHttpServletRequest(); to get the servlet http request, you should now do: javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest httpRequest = ((ServletWebRequest)cycle.getRequest()).getHttpServletRequest();", 
   "Factored out the commons-fileupload dependency. As for portlets we would need the development version of that lib, but the last release was in december 2004, I have no trust in how this library will be maintained. Also, the development version introduces a new dependency, commons-io, for just one concrete class. I lifted out the classes we use, put it in Wicket specific packages and cleaned up the deprecations."
