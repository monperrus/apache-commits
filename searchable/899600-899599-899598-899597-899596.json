   "Fix to make OTEST JCA_2005 work again. This is an @EagerInit scenario and out code was starting scope containers before all endpoints had been registered. With all matching going through the binding/registry now this meant that the reference being used inside the @EagerInit failed to resolve. This change moves the scope container start to after the services are registered."
