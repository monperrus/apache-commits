   "Potential fix for a threading bug. The problem occured when Thread1 [dispose() method] interrupted Thread2 [in run() method] and Thread2 managed to get to notifyAll() before Thread1 got to wait(). This could occur if Thread1 was interupted or Thread2 was already being \"shutdown\"  when Thread1 did the interrupt.",
