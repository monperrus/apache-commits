   "* Fixed: Some ontology export methods were still using the graph storage key to rewrite import statements. This wasn't working well with ontologies created with a GraphContentInputSource. This fix finally solves STANBOL-649", 
   "* Change in the Session REST API: Multiple values for form param \"scope\" are now accepted. These values denote all and only the scopes to be appended to the session. Any other scope will be detached if it was appended earlier. This change is reflected in the Session HTML client by replacing the combo box with checkboxes in the scopes table and an \"Update\" button. Also added hidden form field and extra RESTful service to make sure that a POST with no parameters works and causes all scopes to be detached (STANBOL-700).", 
   "* Reinstated multiple parse attempts in the RESTful Scope and Session resources when POSTing the ontology content. Doing it from the GraphContentInputSource wouldn't work because, although it could reset the BufferedInputStream in order to retry, it could not to the same with the wrapped stream (STANBOL-422)."
