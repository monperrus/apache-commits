   "utility methods out of junit.JDBC and into a new class, junit.XML, per Dan's", 
   "suggestion (thanks Dan).", 
   "Note that I changed the \"haveClass()\" method in JDBC.java from private to", 
   "protected so that it can be called from the junit.XML class.  That was the", 
   "easiest thing to do.", 
   "Since checking the classpath is not a JDBC-specific operation, the other", 
   "option is to move \"haveClass()\" to some other class in the junit package.  If", 
   "anyone indicates a preference for doing so and also indicates the class to", 
   "which the method should be moved, I can do it this way.  Otherwise I'll just", 
   "leave it as it is (i.e. keep it in JDBC.java and make it protected)."
