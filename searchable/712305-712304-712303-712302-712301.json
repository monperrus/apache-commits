   "This also radically simplifies cache interaction in general, and pushes the burden of support into the configuration layer.", 
   "HttpResponse is the only thing I've added serialization support for because GadgetSpec and MessageBundles should generally be cached in memory rather than via shared cache or on disk. If someone feels inclined to add support for serializing these as well, it might be useful."
