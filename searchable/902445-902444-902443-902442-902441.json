   "Removed an incorrect note in the README file of the jaxws-interop sample: the @WebService annotation on the implementation class is actually required by JSR-109/181 and in addition, it is not just replicated from the service interface, but contains different information. Anyway, in the interop sample, the @WebService annotation is necessary to specify the WSDL location."
