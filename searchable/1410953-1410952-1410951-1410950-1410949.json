   "CAMEL-5796: Fixed the resolvement of the property placeholder in combination with the transacted DSL. Thanks to Claus Ibsen for providing a better patch as well as the unit-test for the camel-core module. I also added two tests for the camel-spring module using the propertyPlaceholder and bridgePropertyPlaceholder variants, also polished a tiny generics stuff of the ProcessorDefinition.resolvePropertyPlaceholders() method."
