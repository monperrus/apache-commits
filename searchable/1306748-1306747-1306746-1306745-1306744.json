   "If his/her gender is editable by a customer, the service \"getPartyNameForDate\" should include it if available (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-3483). A patch from Seabastian Leitner: The service \"getPartyNameForDate\" returns the name and some personal data for a person for a specific date. If a person is able to edit its gender, I think it would be nice, if the service would also return the gender as an optional output-parameter, if it's available.", 
   "IMHO this makes sense, if you use the gender to find out the salutation."
