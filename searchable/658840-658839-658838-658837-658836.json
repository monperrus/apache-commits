   "Major layout fixes in the Accounting Fixed Asset screens. I eliminated a number of unnecessary screenlets, added more meaningful UI labels, and changed the arrangement of some screens.", 
   "In the case where a screen has a list of items in combination with a form to add an item to the list, it is better to have the form on top of the list, so that as items are entered, the form isn't scrolled off the screen. In those types of screens, I made the form collapsible so that you have more room to scroll through the list."
