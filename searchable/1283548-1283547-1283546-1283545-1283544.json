   "Fix for shader-transition effects. Previously, if the local bounds of an object shifted position between states (this can happen with a Group, for example, if its children exceeded its bounds in different ways in the states. In the bug's example, a VScrollBar caused the group to go negative in y, an HScrollBar caused it to go negative in x), then the from/to bitmaps would be mis-matched and you'd get a jumping artifact at the beginning of the effect.", 
   "The fix was to get both the bitmap snapshot *and* the bounds of the object captured from BitmapUtil.getSnapshot(). Then use those bounds to constrain the bitmapFrom object to the bitmapTo bounds.", 
   "QE notes: There are 25 Mustella failures from this change. Some are due to a change in the return value from getAffectedProperties (I changed \"bitmap\" to \"bitmapInfo\"). Some are due to a fix to avoid clipping the results of the shader to the size of bitmapFrom (it now uses the max of the two bitmaps). So Mustella needs some fixing and some bitmap updating.",
