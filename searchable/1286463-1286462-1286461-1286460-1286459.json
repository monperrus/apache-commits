   "Added support for explicitWidth,Height to DefaultGridItemRenderer and UITextFieldGridItemRenderer.", 
   "Although UITextField and UIFTETextField both sport explicitWidth,Height properties (but not a common class or interface that defines them) they don't automatically set these properties when you set their width,height and they reset width,height when you call setActualSize().     Since GridLayout only uses setlLayoutBounds() to resize a renderer, I set a flag there so that the concomitant calls to 'set width,height' don't also set explicitWidth,Height.", 
   "Removed the renderer constructor code that initialized the renderers actual width to 4096.   We're already dealing with that in createTypicalItemRenderer(), so the constructor code isn't needed.",

   "Grid layers are now defined as type GridLayer (a private class), instead of Group.", 
   "GridLayer type no longer extends Group, it's now an object that has Group valued root property.   This makes the type's API relatively tiny - only two methods - and makes it possible for GridLayer to encapsulate the Grid itself as a layer (the item renderer layer).", 
   "Grid item renders are now consistently typed as IGridItemRenderer, rather than IVisualElement.", 
   "DefaultGridItemRenderer is now a UIFTETextField subclass and no longer supports the \"textFieldClass\" style.  A new UITextField based item renderer has been added, it's UITextFieldGridItemRenderer.", 
   "Support for the module implications of embedded fonts is now GridColumn's responsiblity.  GridColumn/itemToRenderer() now wraps item renderer ClassFactory item renders with a local ClassFactory subclass that delegates the newInstance() operation to the grid's moduleFactory.",
