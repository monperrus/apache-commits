   "This commit is the first of several commits to start the procedure of moving jetspeed site docs out of source, disassociating documentation from the release cycle. Currently we have two documentation projects being updated: 2.1 releases and 2.2 releases. Here we are checking in the 2.2 documentation and reorganizing to a more guide-structured site. I will be leaving the 2.2 docs in place until I am confident this new approach will work. There are several issues to still work out including:", 
   "* how to get the core Jetspeed Reports and info included.", 
   "* include the Jetspeed API and full Jetspeed Javadocs", 
   "* multimodule build for the docs seems to break the menu (see my email to the dev list)"
