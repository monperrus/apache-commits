   "Removing debug code. Removing dom flag since I will provide a xmlStructure implementation that is based on AXIOM. Some projects that may uses xpath rarely and normally only two different (like in html) can use the StAX based one. If a project needs more flexibility they can use the AXIOM one. I ended up writing both to test perfomance on both. If it results that the AXIOM is as fast as the StAX one I recommend to drop the latest."
