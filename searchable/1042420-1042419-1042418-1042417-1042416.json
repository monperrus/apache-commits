   "Clerezza defines two implementations of the Literal interface", 
   "1) TypedLiteral: used for Literals with an xsd data type", 
   "2) PlainLiteralImpl: used for natural language texts with a language.", 
   "Within the FISE code Literal instances are created by using the LiteralFactory. However this Factory supports only TypedLiterals. Clerezza does not contain a Factory for PlainLiteralImpl. Also when converting TypedLiterals back to there Java Object representation the LiteralFactory requires a TypedLiteral Instance ( see LiteralFactory#createObject(Object,TypedLiteral) method). Therefore there it is very inviting to use a type cast for TypedLiteral when converting Literals to Java Objects.", 
   "For Literals that represent natural language text one should not use the LiteralFactory at all but directly call the Literal#getLexicalForm() method! FISE currently does only use TypedLiterals, therefore such bugs currently do not have any effect.",
