   "[UIMA-951] Specify maven-bundle-plugin version 1.4.0 for all uses, which enables new level of BND which supports new instruction <_nouses>true</_nouses> which prevents the generation of \"uses\" clauses in the exports, which Eclipse 3.2 doesn't support.  Also, even for 3.3 there is a performance issue using \"uses\", see: http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/stp-dev/msg01624.html.  Also, exclude from imports those packages which are split, because otherwise the require-bundle is superceeded by the import-package directive.  Tested and seems to work on both 3.2 and 3.3 eclipse"
