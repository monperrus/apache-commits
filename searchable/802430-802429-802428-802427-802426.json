   "Checked in revised LdapLoginModule and LdapAuthorizer. Notable new features include provisional support for Active Directory, which \"mostly\" works. I also added the ability to bind to LDAP with a specified identity. To to this, we use a new feature of freshcookies-security called a \"keychain\" that stores the binding DN in an password-locked, triple-DES encrypted file. The keychain is available via AuthenticationManager.getKeychain() and can be used for storage of anything sensitive. The keychain is NOT required to be unlocked at startup time (although obviously LDAP binds will fail). We will provide the ability for the admin to unlock the keychain via the web UI in a future build."
