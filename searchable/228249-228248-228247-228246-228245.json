   "smaller area to reduce thread contention.", 
   "Note that since Stack is sync'd, the additional sync on \"this\" may not", 
   "be necessary.  However, since we now use the JDK 1.2 Collections,",

   "o Changed decrementConnections() from \"public\" to \"protected", 
   "synchronized\" (it modifies the totalConnections instance member)."
