   "added a transaction Interceptor hook to a builder so folks can customize how transactions are auto-created when things are sent to an endpoint/processed by an endpoint by default. When using camel-spring the transaction interceptor is auto-created using the TransactionTemplate in the context (if there is just one available). Also we now have a test case for the JPA based IdempotentConsumer"
