   "also the possibility of configuring in the backend the number of participants is miss for the moment.", 
   "added documentation to the basevideoobject and videocontainer", 
   "there is now a new attribute broadcastId, this is the new stream-name-id. The streamid is a unique ID for _each_ client. But a client _could_ use several broadCastID's to publish his setup.", 
   "I hope to fix it that way without reconnecting netconneciton, just be reseting the NetStream and publsih with a new broadCastID"
