   "Resolved issue: DIRMINA-292 (Shared I/O Processors)", 
   "* Added SimpleIoProcessorPool which provides common simple round-robin distribution of IoProcessors", 
   "* Made all IoProcessor implementations public so that SimpleIoProcessorPool can access them", 
   "* Changed all acceptor and connector implementations to accept IoProcessor (including SimpleIoProcessorPool), which natually resolves the 'shared I/O processors' issue.", 
   "* Applied Java 5 Generics to IoProcessor", 
   "Resolved issue: DIRMINA-316 (Manual shutdown of I/O worker threads and Selectors)", 
   "* Added IoService.dispose() - calling dispose releases all resources as soon as possible.", 
   "* Added IoProcessor.dispose() to propagate the disposal request"
