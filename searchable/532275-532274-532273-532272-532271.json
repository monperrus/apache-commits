   "Usability improvements discovered while working on OPENJPA-228. When loading enumerated types in the enhancer, pass them to serp as strings rather than as classes. This permits the use case where a subclass and superclass are both compiled and enhanced, and then the superclass is recompiled, and the subclass and superclass are both listed in persistence.xml, and the enhancer is then invoked.", 
   "Similarly, treat NoSuchMethodErrors that contain the string '.pc' as warnings rather than errors in MetaDataRepository.classForName().", 
   "Finally, changed MetaDataRepository errors to stringify internal data sets eagerly, to avoid leaking incorrect information into error messages."
