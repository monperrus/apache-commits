   "cleaning out the router resolution logic to simplify it. Now, if you specify a source location, it will only load from that one location (only one source is allowed). If not, it will look to see whether you've specified an auto-detection strategy to use...if not, it'll default over to trying to resolve the artifact router from the canonical/default location, which should be hosted in the maven project infra. ...Still seem to be having some sort of race condition in the core ITs...need to keep working on that."
