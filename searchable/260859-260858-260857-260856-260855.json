   "AXISCPP-499 \"No soapaction means handlers can't be called\"", 
   "This fixes the problem where there may not be a soapaction in the wsdl, because the (non-C++) server does not require one. If there is no soapaction, handlers cannot be called since they driven by the soapaction. Soapaction is set by the generated stubs based on the value in the wsdl. This fix only sets the soapaction in the generated stubs if it has not already been set. This allows the client application to override the value in the wsdl. If the client application does not set soapaction and the wsdl doesn't either, then the generated stub will still set it to \"\" since it is mandatory. This fix also adds in getTransportProperty on various classes since it is now needed by the generated stubs."
