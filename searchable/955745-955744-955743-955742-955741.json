   "Change warning C4996 from level 1 to level 4. This is the \"warning C4996: 'std::equal': Function call with parameters that may be unsafe\" warning. The \"safe\" replacements are only available on Windows, so can't be portably used. If the conditions are violated run-time errors are thrown, so these aren't totally ignored. Changing them to level 4 makes it possible for someone to easily find them all in a build if desired."
