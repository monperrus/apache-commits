   "SLING-1927 Upgrade to SLF4J 1.6.1. This requires some internal refactoring because the MessageFormatter now returns FormatterTuple and has support for logging statements of the form log.info(pattern, arg0, arg1, ..., argn, throwable). Also LocationAwareLogger API has been adapted. Finally fix the export/import list to not re-import Commons Logging and Log4J API, since we just implement this API and if there is some other implementation and export for it, we don't care."
