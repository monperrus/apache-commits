   "Removed unused handler from controller files; replaced handlers that were still using the old ScreenWidgetViewHandler with the current MacroScreenViewHandler; deprecated compress.HTML property with output specific properties like screen.compress; this fixes a rather important issue happening when the compress.HTML setting is set to true: non html output screens like for example tab delimited exports were messed up."

   "Javadoc clarifications. The docs for resolvePaths caused some confusion, it seems the original intent was to resolve links (ie make them absolute with the given base) but the actual implementation in DefaultDecorationModelInheritanceAssembler really did the opposite, ie relativize the links wrt the given base. See MSITE-62."
