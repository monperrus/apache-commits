   "Revert the effects of r10233 and r10236 on unix. These changes caused", 
   "the build system to include swig runtime functions in our swig \"core\"", 
   "modules so we wouldn't have to depend on external swig runtime", 
   "libraries. But they also caused a few problems.", 
   "1) They caused a libtool error on linux", 
   "(http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2004-07/0758.shtml).", 
   "Putting the runtime into the core module meant that the other modules", 
   "would need to be linked to it to access the runtime. Libtool would do", 
   "the linking correctly during the initial build, but when it relinked", 
   "the libraries during installation it would try invoke gcc with -l_core,", 
   "which doesn't work because core modules have names like _core.so, not", 
   "lib_core.so. This is probably a bug in libtool.", 
   "2) They don't work on cygwin because they create mutual dependencies", 
   "between core modules and libsvn_swig_(perl|py|java) modules. On cygwin,", 
   "libtool can't make two shared libraries which depend on each other.", 
   "A solution to this which was never committed was to build the", 
   "libsvn_swig_* libraries as static libraries.", 
   "(http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2004-07/0586.shtml)", 
   "3) They don't work on darwin. Having other modules depend on the core", 
   "modules is no good on darwin because the core moules are built", 
   "as dynamically loadable libraries, not dynamically linked libraries", 
   "on that platform. On darwin, a library can be either dynamically",
