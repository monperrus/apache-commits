   "o Added maven-script-ant to wrapper Ant-based Plexus components in a Mojo-compliant shell", 
   "o Added maven-plugin-tools-ant to extract plugin descriptor metadata from Ant-based plugin sources", 
   "o Revised the maven-plugin-tools-model, which can be used as a generic companion metadata file for things like Ant-based mojos. It now includes an analogy to @parameter default-value=\"\"", 
   "o Added javadoc format for DefaultWagonManager, correcting the name of an exception thrown by the configureWagon() method.", 
   "o Changed the required version of maven-plugin-tools-api in the plugin-plugin to 2.0.1-SNAPSHOT, to accommodate changes in the script-based mojo descriptor extractor API. This allows companion metadata files for mojo scripts, as in the case of Ant.", 
   "o Removed maven-plugin-tools-beanshell from the plugin-plugin's dependencies. It can be included as a plugin-dependency in the plugin projects that need it, in similar fashion to Ant's extractors."
