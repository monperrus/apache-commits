   "The MarkupParser can no longer be re-used for multiple markup files. You have to get a new instance from IMarkupParserFactory for every markup file to be parsed (which Wicket-core did already anyway). The MarkupParser API has been changed to make that clear as well.", 
   "This has the advantage that initializing the default set of markup filters now happens in the MarkupParsers constructor and that adding your own filter is now just a matter of invoking appendMarkupFilter() once you created a new MarkupParser. Creating a new MarkupParser happens in MarkupParserFactory (no change) which is registered with Settings (IMarkupSettings). But MarkupParserFactory has changed to reflect the change in MarkupParser. MarkupParserFactory.newMarkupParser(resource) gets you a new MarkupParser. In order add your own IMarkupFilter whenever Wicket requests a parser, you must subclass MarkupParserFactory, substitute newMarkupParser and register your own MarkupParserFactory with Settings.",
