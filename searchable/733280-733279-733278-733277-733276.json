   "Ant scripts now pre-compile JSPs when indicated by build.properties. This is optional.  JSPs are compiled using the Jasper 5.5 jars supplied with our test libs. The jasper-runtime jar is copied into WEB-INF/lib so that the JSPs will run. Also, the Ant 'war' task now verifies web.xml against the servlet 2.4 schema before compiling. Lastly, old crufty targets like Jar-signing and war-tomcat are gone."
