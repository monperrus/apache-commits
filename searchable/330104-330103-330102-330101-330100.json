   "Commiting the patch for DERBY-516, submitted by Rick Hillegas.", 
   "NOTE: AS OF THIS PATCH YOU NEED junit.jar IN YOUR CLASSPATH FOR", 
   "A SUCCESSFUL BUILD AND TEST RUN.  See BUILDING.txt for details.", 
   "This adds support for backward/forward client/server compatibility testing", 
   "into our testing procedures.", 
   "From Rick's patch comments:", 
   "1) BUILDING.txt has been amended to tell developers that they must", 
   "download JUnit.", 
   "2) java/testing/README.htm has been amended to point at a web page", 
   "which describes how to run the compatibility tests. It points at", 
   "java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/compatibility/README.html.", 
   "3) DerbyJUnitTest.java is a superclass for Derby JUnit tests. It is a", 
   "useful place to put extra assertion machinery not included in the", 
   "base JUnit classes.", 
   "4) JDBCDriverTest.java is the actual JUnit test which checks expected", 
   "datatypes.", 
   "5) testScript.xml is an ant harness for running all combinations of", 
   "the compatibility test. Hopefully, we can discard this harness when", 
   "a more robust JUnit harness is checked into Derby.", 
   "6) CompatibilityTest.java is a thin wrapper which runs one", 
   "configuration (embedded) of JDBCDriverTest inside the derbyall", 
   "suite.", 
   "7) Sed.java has been amended to filter out JUnit diagnostics which", 
   "derbyall interprets as noise. This filtering allows derbyall canons", 
   "to be empty for JUnit tests."
