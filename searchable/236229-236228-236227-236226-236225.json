   "- the test is more meaningfull if we compare the POST data with the expected value (in other words, the test wasn't that good before this change)", 
   "- on fast machines and with Tomcat 3.3, it can happen that the request is processed faster than the network !  i.e. Tomcat closes the connection before HttpURLConnection has finished sending POST data ... thus causing a \"connection aborted by peer\" ...",
