   "Checked in the Stripes code (about 220 classes, tests, JSPs and other files. All code compiles clean, but the JSPs do NOT work at the moment. Unit tests run clean except for some stray failing Stripes-related unit tests. See the file doc/README - Stripes Migration for some (repeat, SOME) details of what it all means. I'll sort out the JSP issues later this week."
