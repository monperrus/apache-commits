   "Bug fix to support multiple delegators; these places has a hard-coded dispatcher name that may have been created with a delegator different from the one that is now active and attempted to be used with the same old dispatcher, resulting in undesired database switching; changed to the convention of using the delegator name for the dispatcher name, which is the normal default and should be used everywhere a special dispatcher name specific to a context, like a webapp, is not used"
