   "Fix for rotation issues with explicit width and explicit height for Catalyst. The issue is that when we try to solve width and height such that the post transform bounds satisfy the layout constraints, we only took into account the measured width/height even when there was an explicit size specified. In the case of rotation, it is possible at times to use the explicit width/height to find a fit. Thus, the fix is to try to find a solution first using the explicit size. If no solution exists, then we relax the constraint on the size and try to find other solutions.",
