   "Fixed dist-maven dependencies to be (jar-core,jar-src,javadocs) (since those are the artifacts to be copied and rechristened as maven artifacts).  Not sure why this ever worked before as (compile-core,jar-src)...  The new facet module was failing on 'ant generate-maven-artifacts' (from a clean'd checkout); this change fixes the problem."
