   "revert the static boolean checkFieldCacheSanity that yonik added for SOLR-1875.  since it's in the base class it's dangerous if some test class sets it to false and never sets it back to true.  added additional comments to where assertSaneFieldCaches is called so that if people run into the same situation yonik did in hte future they'll see how to deal with it (either by refactoring, or by using purgeFieldCache)"
