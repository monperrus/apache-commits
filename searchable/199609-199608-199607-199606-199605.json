   "1) Made the tile cache a little more accessable from AbstractTiledRed", 
   "2) Fixed an interrupted bug in TileMap (might put partially rendered tile", 
   "into tile cache).", 
   "3) Renamed progressive paint methods to is/setDoubleBuffered as this is", 
   "a more straightforward description of the functionality.", 
   "3) New version of StaticRenderer.  This version supports double", 
   "buffering, although as of right now no one uses it.", 
   "It is also slightly modified in anticipation of improved versions", 
   "of GVTTreeRenderer, and JGVTComponent that do not suffer from", 
   "'jitter' when panning with progressive paint.", 
   "This commit should fix no existing problems (or introduce new", 
   "ones), but is ground work for changes to come from Stephane."
