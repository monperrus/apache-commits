   "Implement proxy model from SkinnableDataGroup in TextBase.  When the textView part is loaded, store all the properties in the textView.  When the textView part is unloaded, store them back in TextBase.  This eliminates the duplicate set of properties that were getting out of sync.  Text is the one exception to this since we only want to extract the text from the textFlow when it is absolutely necessary.",

   "Integrated a private build of TLF from Rich.", 
   "This build has an additional tabbing-related fix on top of TLF Build 424. We decided to take 424 because it allows all event handling in TextContainerManager to be overridden, which may be important for fixing beta bugs. But Rich also fixed a new bug that I found today: if you had moused over a TextInput or TextArea, then when you tabbed to it you couldn't enter text. This build passed the TextInput and TextArea Mustella tests. We'll take the official 425 tomorrow which will be 424 plus this new fix.",
