   "DERBY-47 (partial): Patch to implement execution-time \"probing\" given a probe", 
   "predicate \"place-holder\" and a list of IN values. This patch creates a new", 
   "execution-time result, MuliProbeTableScanResultSet, to perform the probing.", 
   "At a higher-level the changes in this patch make it so that repeated calls to", 
   "MultiProbeTableScanResultSet.getNextRowCore() will first return all rows matching", 
   "probeValues[0], then all rows matching probeValues[1], and so on (duplicate probe", 
   "values are ignored). Once all matching rows for all values in probeValues have", 
   "been returned, the call to getNextRowCore() will return null, thereby ending", 
   "the scan.", 
   "In order to accommodate the above behavior, the following changes were made to", 
   "existing files:", 
   "1 - Add correct instantiation logic to the \"getMultiProbeTableScanResultSet()\"", 
   "method of GenericResultSetFactory, which was just a stub method before this", 
   "patch.", 
   "2 - Overloaded methods in TableScanResultSet to allow the passing of a \"probe value\"", 
   "into the openScanController() and reopenScanController() methods. The methods", 
   "then use the probe value (if one exists) as the start/stop key for positioning", 
   "a scan, instead of using the start/stop key passed into the result set constructor.", 
   "3 - Made the iapi.types.DataType class implement the java.lang.Comparable interface", 
   "for the sake of easy sorting (just let the JVM do the sort). Since DataType (the", 
   "superclass of all datatypes and base implementation of the DataValueDescriptor", 
   "interface) already has a \"compare()\" method that returns an integer to indicate", 
   "less than, greater than, or equal, all we have to do is wrap that method inside", 
   "a \"compareTo()\" method and we're done."
