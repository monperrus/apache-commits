   "Make previously protected method public. Access to this method is useful for Orchestra Flow. It also seems quite useful in general to layers built on Orchestra.", 
   "Note that this is a minor binary-incompatibility. User code that subclasses ConversationManager and overrides this method with \"protected\" access will fail to compile as this is now a \"reduction of visibility\" error. However it is extremely unlikely that anyone has ever subclassed this class so this should not bother anyone."
