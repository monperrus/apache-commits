   "Adding Changes Proposed by Zach Smith (zsmith@bea.com)", 
   "======================================================", 
   "1. Update external/junit/junit.jar to 3.8.1 (latest).  I have run the", 
   "tests using the new version and saw no problems.  Controls Test Tools", 
   "have a dependecy on interfaces available in the newest version.", 
   "2. Move $BEEHIVE_HOME/tools/* to $BEEHIVE_HOME/controls/test/tools", 
   "All of the files in the root tool folder are controls specific (at this point)", 
   "and having them at the root is confusing.", 
   "3. Remove $BEEHIVE_HOME/controls/test/tools/lib/milton.jar and add the source", 
   "code.  Milton is a testing framework that we have used at BEA and the source", 
   "instead of the jar should have been part of the original checkin", 
   "4. Add controls/test/tools/build.xml file", 
   "5. Update tests and tools to reference peanut and milton from their", 
   "new packages and locations in the tree.", 
   "6. Add httpunit and supporting jars to external/httpunit/."
