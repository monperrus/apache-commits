   "This allows messages to be consumed on one JMS connection, subject and selector and publish them on another JMS connection and destination.", 
   "For example this mechanism can be used to bridge SpiritWave messages to some other JMS provider like MQSeries.", 
   "Also the subscription.xml has been modified a little, adding a new <bridge> element and using 'connection' and 'subject' to refer to the JMS connection name and destination."
