   "Improved handling of how composite control IDs are computed and managed to resolve BEEHIVE-508.  Instead of managing the composite ID locally in each bean, it is now stored in a transient value on the associated context, computed on demand, and cached.  This makes it easier to ensure consistency, because cached values are now easily flushed if a bean is reparented to another context.  Added a DRT test case that verifies control IDs."
