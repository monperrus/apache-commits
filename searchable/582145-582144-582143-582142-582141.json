   "Some improvements to how sequencing is done, including a new method in the GenericDelegator that does a sequence and create all in one, including a single retry with bank refresh on failure because of duplicate ID just in case two sequencers somehow get the same ID bank; in theory that is impossible but it has been observed in production and this is part of the 2 part solution to handle the problem more elegantly than having to restart the servers, and to try to find out just how two sequencers got the same bank of values; this includes changing a number of key code blocks to use the combined sequence and create for retry, and a little bit of code cleanup too"
