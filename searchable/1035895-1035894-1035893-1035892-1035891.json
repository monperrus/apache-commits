   "Reintegrate the issue-3668-3669 branch.", 
   "This fixes issue #3668 'inheritance can result in self-referential mergeinfo'", 
   "and issue #3669 'inheritance can result in mergeinfo describing nonexistent", 
   "sources'.", 
   "The work for both of these issues was done in tandem for two reasons:", 
   "First, because they are very similar, i.e. both are variations of the", 
   "problem where merge tracking's simple inheritance model resulted in", 
   "mergeinfo that contained invalid path-revs (either self-referential or", 
   "simply non-existent).", 
   "Second, the fix for issue #3668, while simple, behaves badly in cases where", 
   "it is corrected but issue #3669 in not, see", 
   "http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3668#desc5", 
   "The core of the issue #3669 fix is two-fold:", 
   "First, rev svn_ra_get_mergeinfo() so it can request that the server", 
   "validate any inherited mergeinfo it returns and second, rev", 
   "svn_repos_fs_get_mergeinfo() so the server can actually perform this", 
   "validation.", 
   "Note that since an RA API was revved, a lot of the noise in this change is", 
   "simply updating the plumbing of the various RA providers.  Any potential", 
   "reviewers wanting to see the heart of this change should probably start here:", 
   "libsvn_fs/fs-loader.c:svn_fs_validate_mergeinfo(): Does the heavy", 
   "lifting of validating mergeinfo.", 
   "libsvn_client/merge.c:get_invalid_inherited_mergeinfo(): Indirectly uses", 
   "the new RA API to determine what portion of WC path's inherited", 
   "mergeinfo is invalid."
