   "When buying drop ship products from the demo store the customer's shipping address is not saved with the purchase order, so the shipping address cannot be provided to the drop ship supplier.", 
   "Steps to Reproduce:", 
   "* From the DropShip Category add \"DropShip from BigSupplier\" and \"DropShip from DemoSupplier\" to your cart.", 
   "* Login as admin", 
   "* Use the one page checkout to order the products",

   "Actual:", 
   "Only the first shipment group has the shipping address assigned."
