   "TUSCANY-2824 - turn WSSecurity based policy back on. Two not so great fixes here. Firstly WSSecurityPolicyHandler pushes a property into the Axis configuration context to force Rampart to recognize the policy. I haven't discovered what part of our configuration is required to do this properly. Secondly I fixed the helloworld-ws-service-secure test case to reference the wsdl on binding.ws. Without this you get a NPE in axis/rampart as it fails to map binding operations to port type operation using QNames (don't know why it thinks these are QNames). Our generated WSDL has the generated binding in a different namespace to the port type. Associating the wsdl binding with binding.ws means that the binding is not generated at the made up QNames match. I also updated a few key stores as the runtime was complaining about X509 certificate version numbers."
