   "bye, bye old menu tag code :)", 
   "this commit removes all of the old velocity menu tag code and replaces it by using the new menu code.  the old use of the menu tag in weblog rendering has been replaced with 2 new methods in the MenuModel and some updated macro definitions.", 
   "NOTE: this commit removes the use of 3 methods from the weblog rendering velocity context, 1) MenuModel.showAuthorMenu(), 2) OldPageHelper.showMenu(), and 3) OldPageHelper.showEditorNavBar().  technically this could be a concern for backwards compatability, but we can pretty reasonably expect that these methods were only called from Roller macro calls which still function properly."
