   "In addressing SDK-17370 two things were apparent. 1. Batik's parsing of @font-face unicode-ranges needed to be fixed (Batik bug 46055). 2. The syntax that Flex suggests for unicode range pairs was not compliant with the CSS2 specification. The second 'U+' is not needed in the range pair.",

   "QE: Yes, can we go over our unicode-range tests and update them to use the correct syntax in unicode-range pairs? Also please review the CSS-2 specification to ensure we've covered the variants of wildcards and range syntax. http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#dataqual",
