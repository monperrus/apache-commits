   "adding destFile naming scheme to tar, for consistency with the zip family and other tasks. I know Costin thinks we do this deliberately, just to break his builds, so even though I have updated the manual and the test cases, I have commented out the deprecated message which users should get when they use the tarfile attribute. Which means old builds still work, but the old params are no longer documented for new users."
