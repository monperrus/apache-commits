   "Changed the implementation of charset overrides for widget start pages. Setting the response type for a GET has no effect on the server at all and it will use the default setting (UTF-8 on Tomcat; ISO on Jetty). So instead I've changed the StartPageProcessor to inject a <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\"> tag into the <head> of the start page with the encoding and type overrides from the Widget's <content> element. This addresses issue WOOKIE-93."
