   "Another fix for the base64 stream implementation that addresses three issues:", 
   "1. Fixed a bun introduced with the last fix for uploads with no content stream - now uploads with content stream work again as well", 
   "2. Unnecessary log statements removed - it happens all the time that the base64InputStream is not yet opened when the encoder Stream receives an NSStreamEventHasSpaceAvailable without causing any issues", 
   "3. Added a workaround for the 'Stream ... is sending an event before being opened' Apple bug that seems to work - when the encoder stream is opened we also open the bound base64InputStream although this should be done by the NSURLRequest but doing it here apparently causes no harm and fixes the bug"
