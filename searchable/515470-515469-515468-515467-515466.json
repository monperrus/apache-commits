   "Fixing ROL-1359. It wasn't a case of it using the root all the time (as you'd assume from the symptoms) but of it using the grandparent folder rather than the parent folder for the bookmark. Changing parentFolder.parent.path to parentFolder.path fixes this. I also removed the line below the Bookmark title which specifies 'Path: /Foo' etc. It seems pointless to repeat the path after listing it in the subtitle."
