   "DIRSERVER-1017 - Corrected SVN Source URL for packaging of docs in installers.  I am commenting out this section of the pom to match 1.5.1 since this checks out fresh code on every build of the installers and unless it is a release build, the code is older than the SNAPSHOT build since it references a release branch.  We can find a better way to do this if we need to."
