   "Proposed Contribution to Apache - WSIF from Paul Fremantle, WebServices Architect, IBM Hursley (pzf@hursley.ibm.com)", 
   "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", 
   "Here's the attached note from Paul:", 
   "IBM has developed a codebase called WSIF (WebServices Invocation Framework) which has been available on alphaWorks for some time now (www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/wsif). WSIF provides two main things: an SPI or pluggable provider model that matches the extensibility of WSDL - so if new ports and bindings are developed, WSIF allows existing clients to access services without changes to the code. Also WSIF supports a Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII) that is very closely modelled on WSDL, which is useful in building dynamic tools, such as flow engines. We have done a considerable amount of work on WSIF since the alphaWorks release, and we would like to propose contributing this to Apache. We are interested in your feedback on this proposal - including where it should be posted, proposed package names, and how we could work to use this in an Apache WebServices context. I have attached a couple of files - the source code and a brief overview of WSIF. There are also two good articles on WSIF on developerWorks",

   "Architecture & Details: http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-wsif2/index.html", 
   "(please note the APIs have changed since those articles were published).",
