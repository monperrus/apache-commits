   "Don't use the discovery mechanism for cache impls. for now, this means the AbderaClient is hard coded to use the LRUCache in-memory cache implementation. The original design meant for the cache implementation to be pluggable. Ideally, however, the HttpClient would incorporate some kind of cache so we wouldn't have to do this at all. I'm wondering if there's some way we could separate all the http client related stuff out to a distinct subproject?"
