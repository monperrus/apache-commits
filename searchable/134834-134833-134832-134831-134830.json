   "Added JavaScript, JPython and PNuts core tag libraries. They kinda work, at least the PNuts one does, though more investigation is required to map BSF beans properly to Jelly scopes. Right now there's a minor hack in there to get it to work. Also for some wierd reason JavaScript (Rhino) doesn't see declared beans."
