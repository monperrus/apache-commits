   "porting the analyzer abstract class and created a prototype of a ThreadLocal<T> that *should work for silverlight. Windows Mobile 7's version of silverlight does not have the [ThreadStatic] attribute, Thread.GetData/SetData or ConcurrentDictionary<T>. So a port of .NET 4's ThreadLocal<T> should help alleviate issues with that. Suggestions on testing stratagies would be appreciated."
