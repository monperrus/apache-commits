   "When a query projects and groups on a relation field, make sure to group on",

   "by translating select() calls into groupBy() calls isn't necessarily pretty,", 
   "but it allows us to re-use all our existing select logic (not just in", 
   "JDBCStoreManager, but in all the class, field, discriminator, version, etc", 
   "mapping strategies) rather than creating duplicate logic in parallel groupBy()", 
   "methods in all these components."
