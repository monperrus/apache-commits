   "Removed fast async socket sender, the async logic should not be on the socket level. the same functionality can very easy be achieved through a interceptor that uses the fast queue or a tipi on top of the channel.", 
   "The channel itself should only do one thing well, send messages, very fast and guaranteed. if the socket is async, then the error message can never trickle up to the sender, and the sender will never know that the message failed"
