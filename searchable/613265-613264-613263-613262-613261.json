   "[UIMA-708] change the phase of the copying of LICENSE NOTICES DISCLAIMER to process-resources, which is beyond the phase that the eclipse:eclipse plugin does, so that running eclipse:eclipse no longer copies these files.  Because this is past the time where resources are copied to the target, do that copying also.  Finally, change the phase for the time-stamp creation task to later, so that other tasks don't have to do it.  It must come before use, but the only use is in the packaging (jar) phase, which is quite late."
