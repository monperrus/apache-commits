   "Many unit test fixes, including many to JSPWikiMarkupParser. Over 90% of tests pass now. WikiPath is now truly immutable. DefaultURLConstructor omits the space name from pages if in the main space, and colons are no longer URLencoded. Fixed bug in ContentManager that was preventing page ACLs from being changed correctly if a user's name changed."
