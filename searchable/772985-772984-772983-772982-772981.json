   "JS2-995: Fixing non-thread-safe session attribute (PortalSiteSessionContext object) usage problem.", 
   "When a thread sets an instance to session, then the previous instance from the same session in another thread receives valueUnbound() event, which invalidate the state before retrieving managed page.", 
   "This problem rarely happen in portal pipeline because every request pipeline is the same, so there's no need to renew the siteSessionContext.", 
   "However, under desktop mode, there could be multiple simultaneous requests to ajax-pipeline, so it can happen sometimes.", 
   "Of course, even in portal pipeline, this problem can happen when there are simultaneous requests from the same session. (e.g. from multiple iframes.)"
