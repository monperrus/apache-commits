   "Made extensive changes to design based on evaluation of both", 
   "Crimson and Xerces codebases. Some of those changes include", 
   "the following:", 
   "1) Renaming \"XMLConfigurable\" to \"XMLComponent\" to better", 
   "reflect its purpose in the design.", 
   "2) Renamed some callback methods in the various handler", 
   "interfaces to match SAX naming conventions. While the", 
   "method prototypes are different in many cases, at", 
   "least the names will be familiar to people working with", 
   "both sets of interfaces.", 
   "3) Some methods were missing from \"XMLAttributes\".", 
   "4) Greatly simplified the \"XMLEntityReader\" based on ideas", 
   "from Crimson codebase. This also simplified and updated", 
   "the \"XMLEntityManager\" class.", 
   "5) Removed utility class to handle namespace scopes. Since", 
   "we depend on SAX, it makes sense to use their helper", 
   "class in the implementation to do this work.", 
   "Some things that still need to be worked on include:", 
   "6) Changing validation design from \"validate on way out\"", 
   "to \"validate on way in\". This is a controversial", 
   "decision because it's such a performance hit. This", 
   "choice was made to be able to handle the Schema \"any\"", 
   "feature where you have to skip the contents of that", 
   "element. But Eric Ye has shown that we can do this", 
   "in the current configuration. So more thought needs", 
   "to be done in this area.", 
   "7) Packaging and making it easy to create custom", 
   "implementations and configurations of XML parsers."
