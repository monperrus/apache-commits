   "STANBOL-1030: implemented feature as described in the Issue. In addition the EntityhubLinkingEngine now ensures that EntityRankings are included for EntitySearcher results; STANBOL-1013: several improvements to the internal API of ProcessingState (NLP based spotting of Entities); STANBOL-1011: Moved the MIN_SEARCH_TOKEN_LEGTH property from the EntityLinking to the TextProcessing configuration. This makes the ProcessingState (future NLP spotting) independent from the EntityLinking configuration - a pre requirement for separating the Spotting from Linking as intended by STANBOL-1013."
