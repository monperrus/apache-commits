   "Inability to find a currentView no longer an Exception-causing event in Processor.process()", 
   "In other words, a Gadget with null currentView is a valid return value. The receiver of the Gadget object determines whether a currentView",

   "reenables that functionality at least.", 
   "Meanwhile, Renderer updated to check that getCurrentView() is non-null. If it is, an error is thrown (the same as if a ProcessingException",
