   "Made change recommended by Scott Gray to move to better behavior when a mail store can't be connected to on startup, ie keep track of it anyway and just log messages over time about failure; I agree that it seems silly to give up on it for as long as the server is running just because we couldn't connect on startup; Apache Jira #OFBIZ-140"
