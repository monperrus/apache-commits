   "[master] Add support in hbase-daemon for regionserver stop-for-restart", 
   "Author: mbm", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Since hadoopctl wants (and kind of needs) to own the stopping and starting", 
   "of its daemons for restarts, this exposes an interface to the the jruby used", 
   "in doing the localised restart of the regionserver. hadoopctl can pick this", 
   "up and use this during a restart.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "This has been tested successfully on hbase430.frc1 (though it gets reverted", 
   "by fbdeploy - or something similar - periodically). Basically - the tests", 
   "for the positive situation and negative situations with hadoopctl (other", 
   "types of stop, hbase-daemon.sh that doesn't support stop-for-restart etc)", 
   "all now pass.",
