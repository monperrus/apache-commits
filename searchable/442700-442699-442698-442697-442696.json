   "A straight port of r439885 from the shale-dialog2-legacy module. Improves parsing of dialog-config.xml files and adds logging.", 
   "Currently the SCXML and Legacy dialogs use the same default file name for dialog descriptions (WEB-INF/dialog-config.xml). We had discussed (a while ago) the possibility of being able to use both dialog schemes in a Shale app, we can look at that in round two (round one would be to get the SCXML bits up and running). Also, while we may come up with such a scheme to enable both in the same app if there is interest, subdialogs will need to use homogeneous schemes as the parent dialog."
