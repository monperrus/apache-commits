   "Moved selenium test out into a macro to allow better code reuse. Added new task run-all-unit-tests to run unit tests with rhino, selenium tests with ahead-of-time compilation, and selenium tests with just-in-time compilation. Note that selenium tests with just-in-time compilation are currently broken in IE, although manual testing succeeds."
