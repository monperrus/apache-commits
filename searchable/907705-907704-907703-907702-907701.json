   "* The Modeler attempts to read the project before checking whether an upgrade is needed. Not a good idea as the older or newer format may cause an exception, instead of an upgrade message. Right now it simply prints a few warnings in the logs, but still worth doing this right - check upgrade status before reading the project. It will work faster too.", 
   "* More on upgrades... There is a new UpgradeType that we didn't have before: INTERMEDIATE_UPGRADE_NEEDED. We need to check for it in the OpenProjectAction and display a special dialog. This is for the projects older than 3.0. We can't upgrade them correctly and will tell the users to download Modeler of {UpgradeMetadata.intermediateUpgradeVersion} first and do an intermediate upgrade before doing 3.1 upgrade."
