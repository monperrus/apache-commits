   "The following changes are made for interop/encoding:", 
   "I ran all of the tests including the interop tests to verify",

   "1) Added the delegate() method to TypeMappingRegistry.", 
   "This provides the function of the old setParent() stuff and", 
   "is necessary to tie together service and deploy typeMappings.", 
   "2) Changed the samples.echo.TestClient to register array complexType", 
   "deserializers.  Some of the services pass back", 
   "type=urn:ArrayOfFoo instead of the normal type=soapenc:Array.", 
   "So to interoperate we need to register the deserializers.", 
   "a) the deploy.wsdd and stub changes are defered.", 
   "b) A side effect is that a small change was necessary", 
   "in the array serializer to force the type to soapenc:Array.", 
   "Registering the deserializers had a bad side effect of", 
   "damaging the type attribute.", 
   "c) Also needed to change the call.registerTypeMapping() to", 
   "register the serializer/deserializer in the proper typemapping.", 
   "(This lead to the changes in 1)", 
   "3) Changed the Base64 serializers/deserializers to operate", 
   "with Byte[] (used to only work with byte[])", 
   "4) Changed soapenc:base64 to deserialize as byte[] not Byte[] so that we are", 
   "interoperable.  (Some services return soapenc:base64 when passed", 
   "xsd:base64Binary)", 
   "5) Changed the defaultTypeMapping to understand how to deserialize", 
   "soapenc primitives.  Added two small tests into TestDeser to verify", 
   "this behavior since we don't pass SOAP 1.2 over the wire."
