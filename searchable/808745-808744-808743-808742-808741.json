   "Added the possibility of processing/displaying xml files in the docbook format in verious other formats like html pdf etc. To view the Example document in HTML format go to content -> content ->  navigate -> documents -> 'apache ofbiz in html format' The HTML version is working however the pdf version does not work yet. If you want to help, have a look in ModelScreenWidget.java where at the moment the complete processing from xml to pdf is concentrated the problem is the empty pdf output document with the wrong mimetype."
