   "TUSCANY-3894.  Refactor local sca binding so that the exact details of the data copy can be plugged in via the BindingProviderFactory extension point, while keeping a core, base portion of the binding to do things like calculate whether to do the pass-by-reference optimization and establish other aspects of the invoker/interceptor chain.   The data handling is factored into a BindingSCATransformer class.  The default impl will continue to use MediatorImpl.copyXXX methods, and will use Java-serialization first then XML/JAXB-serialization.   The second impl included uses XML serialization and calculates a WSDL interfaceContract."
