   "SCXML-196: The Algorithm for SCXML interpretation requires sets of TransitionTarget instances to be processed.", 
   "To conform to the Set equality contract TransitionTarget must implement the equals and hashcode methods.", 
   "But in the context of SCXML and the purpose of the algorithm, really only identity based equality should be considered.", 
   "The TransitionTarget#id property also could be used, but that would make the API much more awkward to ensure only unique IDs are used, that is: within the context of a single SCXML instance.", 
   "Much easier therefore is to just enforce and only support identity based equality."
