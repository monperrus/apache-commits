   "Server side patch for SHINDIG-750. Adds support for the 'path' parameter, which is used for relative resolution in requestNavigateTo. This requires container support ensure that when requestNavigateTo(string, string) is called, \"path\" is passed to the gadget renderer as a query string instead of passing view parameters."

   "- Adds several tests", 
   "- Allows requestNavigateTo to take a string instead of a View (spec change)", 
   "- Optionally adds event handlers to all anchors with hrefs that are not missing, fragments, or absolute. The remaining URIs (relative uris) would not work under existing gadgets anyway. To use this, you must add rewriteLinks : true to your container config for the \"views\" feature.", 
   "GadgetRenderingServlet still has to be modified to accept a parameter that will specify the relative path for navigation as required by the spec. Containers that are supporting the enhanced requestNavigateTo must ensure that they are passing this parameter in order for it to work correctly."
