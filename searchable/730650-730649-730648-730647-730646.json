   "Some minor changes to make Savan compile/work with Axis2 SNAPSHOT:", 
   "* httpcore is not a dependency of axis2-kernel anymore -> use HttpStatus from httpclient instead.",

   "* JUnit is no longer a dependency of axis2-kernel -> add it explicitly in scope test.", 
   "* The HTTP transport is no longer part of axis2-kernel -> set up a Maven profile that adds the required dependency if axis2.version is set to SNAPSHOT."
