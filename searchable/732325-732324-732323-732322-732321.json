   "[WSS-154] - A fix for this issue + tests", 
   "- The problem was that a custom processor or action could only be specified via a String", 
   "corresponding to the classname, which was only instantiated when getProcessor/getAction was", 
   "called. This is inconvenient if e.g. the object in question is to be spring-loaded.", 
   "- I took a different solution to the proposed patch. The processor map in WSSConfig can now be", 
   "considered as <String, String> or <String,Processor> (similarly for the action map). When", 
   "getProcessor(QName) is called, if the object in the Map is a processor it's simply returned, if", 
   "it's a String, it gets classloaded etc. This is fully backwards compatible.", 
   "- So to use a custom processor instance, you can just do e.g.:", 
   "WSSConfig cfg = WSSConfig.getNewInstance();", 
   "cfg.setProcessor(WSSecurityEngine.SIGNATURE, new wssec.MyProcessor());", 
   "final WSSecurityEngine engine = new WSSecurityEngine();", 
   "engine.setWssConfig(cfg);", 
   "engine.processSecurityHeader(....)"
