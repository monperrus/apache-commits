There is still some work to do to consolidate and cleanup older code, and an issue with approximations under certain conditions (that is my next task).", 
   "The most remarkable difference from the existing code (that was an incomplete implementation of the processes needed to effectively use billing accounts) is that now payment applications are *not* applied to a billing account; they are simply associated to it and can be applied to pay the invoices associated to the billing account."
