   "* Fix DOOM bug in SOAPEnvelopeImpl where it would allow a SOAPHeader to come after a SOAPBody.  This was being masked by getHeader(), which used to call getFirstChildWithName() - so of course the header would show up even though it was after the body.  Once I fixed getHeader() to only check the first element, a SAAJ test started breaking because getHeader() was returning null.", 
   "* Add a test to make sure we don't regress the above.", 
   "* More work on versioning, move static QName constants up to SOAP*Constants interface, and provide a way to get MU faultcode QName from SOAPVersion.", 
   "* Make sure a null RolePlayer means doing the default search (ultimate receiver and next, but nothing else) for targeted headers."
