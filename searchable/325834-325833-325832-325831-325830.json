   "* Introduce RPCValues class to hold actual instance values, so that we can have just a singleton of each RPCMethod description class.", 
   "* Some work on local transport - it now supports in-out interactions.", 
   "* Add simple RPC test to demonstrate the runtime functionality - this DOES work in my IDE, but DOES NOT work in maven for some reason.  I think this is related to picking up the default client configuration when Call's default constructor is used, but didn't have time to wade all the way through.  Checked in for now, but commented out.", 
   "* Some refactoring and bug fixes"
