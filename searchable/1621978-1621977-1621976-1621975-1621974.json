   "Implement changelist filtering in WC diffs by post-filtering.", 
   "This work was triggered by a bug report sent in by Peter Galcik, who noticed", 
   "that svn 1.8 crashed when requesting a repos-WC diff with changelist", 
   "filtering. In fixing that crash I noticed that the changelist filtering was", 
   "deficient in several other respects.", 
   "Changes are passed through a changelist-filtering 'diff processor'. This", 
   "approach is similar to how diff reversal and some other options are now", 
   "handled, and should be easier to get right and to maintain than embedding", 
   "changelist filtering in both of the diff implementations. On the other hand,", 
   "this approach will usually be less efficient than a pre-filtering approach.", 
   "TODO: We need tests for changelist filtering. I tested this patch by hand,", 
   "not comprehensively.",
