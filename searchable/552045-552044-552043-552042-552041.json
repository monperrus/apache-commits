   "Accept both dotted (\".jar\") and undotted (\"jar\") values for the extension attribute of custom deployers.  The dot is really redundant, since we're using lastIndexOf('.') to find the beginning of the extension anyway - it's pretty silly to force devs to type it, so now (again) they don't have to.  If we find one with a leading dot, we strip it and go on.",

   "Fixed a test page so that it had the correct currencyCode attribute for a JSF convertNumber tag and works with MyFaces. I also added a new TestRecorder recording to the JSF suite to cover this converter tags page. Note that the markup generated from MyFaces tags includes a hidden input tag \"jsf_sequence\" which increment for each form in each page hit in the user session... all the tests that follow the new FacesSmokeConverters test had to be updated for MyFaces.",
