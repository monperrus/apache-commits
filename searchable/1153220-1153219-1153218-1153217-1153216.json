   "Checking in work in progress for RAVE-151 (generating encrypted security tokens server side).  To facilitate generating security tokens for RegionWidgets I really need a mechanism for getting the \"owner\" of a given RegionWidget -- and the simplest way to do that is to go ahead and add the back-reference JPA relationships to parent entities so that we can just walk the tree back up from the RegionWidget --> Region --> Page --> Owner.  This commit adds the additional JPA relationship annotations to do that, and also adds the Jackson annotations required to work around the circular references that occur without them during serialization to json.",
