   "Fixed the 'filter' section of the orderlist and findOrders screen. Both had output formating issues, but orderlist was also checking for wrong field name in bsh file so it would never show any results.  NB These two screens could be improved to re-use more of the logic related to populating the filter lists, but this is just a bug fix for now."
