   "[HBASE-7267] Only create the dummy hfile for the compaction if necessary.", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary:", 
   "In HBASE-6059, it introduced a new behavior that the compaction would create the HFileWriter no mater whether there is any key/value as the output or not. This new behavior actually is conflicts with HBASE-5199 (Delete out of TTL store files before compaction selection) so that compacting the expired hfiles would generate one more expired hfiles.", 
   "Actually we only needs to create the dummy hfile IFF the maxSequenceID among the compaction candidates is equal to the maxSequenceID among all the on-disk hfiles.", 
   "Also I revert some the unit test changes for the TestStore from https://reviews.facebook.net/D5175 based on this new behavior",
