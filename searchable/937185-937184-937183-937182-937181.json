   "Remove the idstribution webapp tests. These didn't work well for a number of reasons. they didn't test what was in the distribution as the distribution doesn't include the built webapps. Because they need a dependency on the distribution all the all distro dependencies get on the classpath so they're not testing what is included in the webapp. There seems to be bugs oin the cargo plugin so that it doesn't free up all its resourecs till the very end of the build"
