   "Add SWCs linked as RSLs to the timestamps in OEMReport.", 
   "The bug is applications that link with a library using RSL linkage are not recompiled when the library changes. Before the RSL sharing feature this behavior was expected if the application did not use any classes in the library. But now an application will store the digests of RSLs it doesn\u2019t use so child applications can check if they should load an RSL into its ApplicationDomain. So we need to recompile the application so new digests can be put in the generated code.",
