   "Patch so that boolean property getters are found first, before a get(\"foo\") is called.", 
   "So for a given property foo the order of priority is to look for",

   "* isFoo()", 
   "* get(\"foo\")", 
   "So this change just makes boolean getters (isFoo()) of equal priority as other types of getters, like getFoo().", 
   "It also has a nice side effect of making the unit tests work as I'd reused Foo for the isSimple() test which also had a get(String) method."
