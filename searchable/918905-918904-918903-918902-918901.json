   "Added back code similar to code before to use selected values in a count instead of ignoring them, which is necessary to get a distinct count when you are not selecting all fields/columns; now looks for the SQL generated with the function=count-distinct stuff is used so that it will function the old way and not include the column name at all, so hopefully that will take care of that problem while fixing the main bug of ignoring the selected fields set"
