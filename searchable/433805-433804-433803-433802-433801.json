   "- For .css generation, instead of having a hardcoded list of \"fake\" pseudo-classes to map to selectors (e.g. :read-only to .pAFReadOnly), use a hardcoded list of the pseudo-classes that are built-in to CSS 2, and map everything else.  The code does not yet handle CSS 2 pseudo-elements, or make any decision about what to do with the many coming CSS 3 pseudo-classes.  This change does expose opportunities for component developers to create state pseudo-classes specific to their components.", 
   "- Fix navigationPane styles to not do double \"::\" - e.g., ::bar::bar-enabled should just be ::bar-enabled (this was actually triggering some wackiness in the .css generation code)", 
   "- Fix navigationPane styles to change navigationPaneTab to navigationPane::tab", 
   "- Update golden files accordingly."
