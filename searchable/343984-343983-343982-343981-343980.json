   "Improving Unit test monitor so that it handles responses better. It now does better guesses at chunk sizes. A number of tests were failing because the user had put in bad chunk sizes and these had not been picked up in the past because (don't ask!) we used to send out each response twice. When I fixed that I realised the chunk size problem. this is quite a big change and might mean that unix test break - but I have tried to prevent that."
