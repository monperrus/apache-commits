   "Re-factored the authentication subsystem to remove the need for JAAS configuration files. WEB-INF/jspwiki.jaas goes away, as does the need for PolicyLoader. Also, responsibilities for web authentication move to WikiServletFilter. Authentication is now configured via jspwiki.properties -- see that file for details. WikiSession API change: getLoginContext() vanishes."
