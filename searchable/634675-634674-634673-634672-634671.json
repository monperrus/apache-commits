   "Note: This is a feature regression. You can not change the state file url yet nor dump the current state to the page. The do evil flag also no longer works. opensocial-0.7 does not allow updating of app data. These will all come back in subsequent changes. (hopefully very shortly)", 
   "The opensocial-0.7 js code is much more advanced, so if you were relying on samplecontainer.js now is a good time to switch your code over."
