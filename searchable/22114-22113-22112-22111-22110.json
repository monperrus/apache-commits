   "1. Updates to magic - correcting a number of bugs that were the cause of the issues posted by Aaron and Tim.  In the process added support for magic.properties defintion of magic.cache and magic.docs so that we can easily map magic content generation into other repositories.", 
   "2. Update to the composition impl to handle the making of a container as \"dirty\" if a component is added when the container is assembled - and from this, the ability to re-assemble the container without requireing dissassembly of existing models.  Updates include a testcase to validate the addition of a new component model (identified as an issue on users@avalon by Eike Stepper).", 
   "3. Fixed several bugs/issues in properties and layout - one in particular was the layout of the merlin-cli module which was causing a build failure due to incorect generation of artifact references."
