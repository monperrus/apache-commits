   "Fix these bitmaps.  These tests have a flaw that they move the TitleWindows around so whatever tests run before can affect dropshadows on the borders of the target TitleWindow.  These bitmaps are now setup for a full run, but will fail if run individually.  The right fix is probably to move the TitleWindows back to where they started from."
