   "In order to send over http the values to create, store and remove, Ofbiz is Xml serializing the values. GenericValue xml serialization is managed in GenericEntity.makeXmlElement, unfortunately this method just don't serialized null valued fields.", 
   "To solve this issue, I managed null value the same way GenericEntity.setString (which is used for the Xml deserializing). I only managed until case 10, because i'm not sure the setString for the cases 11 to 15 are well managed (not taking care of null value)", 
   "jleroux: After looking at GenericEntity.setString and initial commit (http://svn.ofbiz.org/viewcvs?rev=7779&view=rev) I see no reasons to not handling cases under 10 the same way. So I added these cases as well using fall through."
