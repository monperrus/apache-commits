   "when normalizing a String object to upper- or lowercase for a normalized comparison to some internal constant, it turns out that we need to be very careful not to rely on the default encoding of the platform.  This results from the fact that Turkish in particular does not map characters to their upper- or lowercase equivalents in English.  Now, everywhere where this could pose a problem, we force case conversion to be done according to an English locale."
