   "This change will ensure that properties set on an SEI's DBC are included when an EndpointDescription is created from an Impl's DBC. Prior to this change, only the Impl DBC's properties were transferred to the EndpointDescription. Now, if an SEI is present, both the SEI and Impl's properties will be transferred to the EndpointDescription instance."
