   "[master] Average load should compensate for ignored servers", 
   "Summary:", 
   "When computing the average load across region servers for load balancing", 
   "purposes, ServerManager ignores all regions hosted by servers which have", 
   "regions being held for them (preferred assignments). However, the number", 
   "of servers over which the load was being averaged was not adjusted,", 
   "causing the average load to change significantly (and incorrectly)", 
   "whenever a preferred assignment was made.", 
   "This change adjusts the number of servers when computing the average", 
   "load, to compensate for the servers which are ignored.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "mvn -Dtest=TestRegionRebalancing test", 
   "Use the shell's move_region command on a balanced cluster and observe", 
   "that there are no extraneous region movements.",

   "[master] Preferred assignments should ignore servers with no load info", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Before a server becomes dead or its info is removed from the collection", 
   "of server infos, it may be in the process of shutting down. Regions with", 
   "preferred assignments should not go to servers which are in such a", 
   "state, as identified by the absence of load information, which is among", 
   "the first things to be removed when a server shuts down.", 
   "Before, regions might get transient assignments to a server which is in", 
   "the process of shutting down, then that assignment would have to timeout", 
   "before the region could be assigned to another server. This change", 
   "should prevent that.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "Gracefully stop a region server which is the primary favored node for", 
   "some regions. Observe that those regions move to secondary or tertiary", 
   "nodes immediately.",
