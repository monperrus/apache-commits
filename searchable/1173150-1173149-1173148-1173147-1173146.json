   "Commented out part of the persistence test that used a deprecated setAuthor() method as it has been causing build failures due to tests generating an exception. It doesn't indicate an actual code problem - the deprecated method redirects to the new implementation, but this won't work in the current transaction scope of the JPA tests. In future we could replace it with something, but it isn't critical as the other properties set by the test method adequately cover the test case."
