   "In order to run OFBiz in debug mode under Eclipse with hot class reloading, one needs to add the following Converters to the services framework/entity/src/META-INF/services/org.ofbiz.base.conversion.ConverterLoader because they are added at build time by the build.xml of the framework. Thus, they are missing when running OFBiz as an full Eclipse debug launcher.",
