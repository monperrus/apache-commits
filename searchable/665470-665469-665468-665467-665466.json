   "Thrift: Fix a bug in local reflection generation.", 
   "Summary:", 
   "The problem was that in generate_local_reflection, we refused to", 
   "generate reflections for types defined in another program, including enums.", 
   "But in local_reflection_name, we treated enums like base types,", 
   "assuming that their reflections were always defined in this program.", 
   "One solution would be to treat enums like base types everywhere, and always", 
   "generate their reflections in the program where they were being used.", 
   "But this change takes the opposite approach.  We now always", 
   "generate fingerprints for enums in the program in which they are defined,", 
   "even if they are not used there.",
