   "Patch to fix dIon's bug with JSL. The fix was for TagScript to properly set the parent tag each time its used; there was a danger of the Tag being cached and its old parent being used when inside loops. This should now fix any similar related bugs.", 
   "Moving forward, it might be worth optimizing the TagScript code so that the Script.run() method takes the parent Tag to use. Then the thread local tag hierarchy can be maintained on the stack, rather than using ThreadLocal variables that we currently use. This would be faster and simpler I suspect."

   "Still haven't fixed dIon's bug yet but it appears to be an issue caused by the tag hierarchy being stale when a stylesheet is defined within a loop (the ExprTag thinks it has the 1st parent tag when it is invoked for the 2nd time). I should have a fix for this very soon...."
