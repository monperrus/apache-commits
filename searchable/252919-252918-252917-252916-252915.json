   "- Add getExceptionName() method to Utils to centralize fault/exception name mapping", 
   "- The exception name is derived from the fault Message name instead of the fault name (per JAX-RPC 0.5)", 
   "Hopefully this will change in the next draft.", 
   "- Move the stack trace of an AxisFault to the Detail section.", 
   "- Change emitter to emit fault exception classes even when --skeleton switch is not on.", 
   "- Use Constants instead of string literals for soap fault sections."
