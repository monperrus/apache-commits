   "- initialization of the logging framework from inside Chainsaw is now deferred to as late as possible in order to allow the internal event handlers to be configured and added to the logger hierarchy.  This meant deferring the creation of loggers in helper classes and changing helper classes to not use static loggers where necessary", 
   "- improved level inequality rule logic to trigger an illegalargumentexception if an unknown level is passed in", 
   "- added customsqldbreceiver and included access to javadoc in Chainsaw's help menu, added xml config example to Chainsaw's sample receiver config file", 
   "- added empty string check in expressionrule to prevent string out of bounds errors", 
   "- modified tablecolorizingrenderer in an attempt to simplify the code and prevent null pointer exceptions when a null value was received by the renderer"
