   "Fixes in both the generator and renderkit test framework to support Enum-typed properties", 
   "- Support mfp:enum metadata in property-extension to tell the generator that a property is an enum (since it may not actually have access to the class to find out directly)", 
   "- Support for default values in the component generator", 
   "- RenderKitTest: Hack to (theoretically) support testing attribute values of enums", 
   "- RenderKitTest: Hack to support property types that are inner classes (the metadata uses '.' syntax, but the classloader wants '$' syntax)"
