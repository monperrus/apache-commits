   "This is the initial checkin of the work to allow a ControlBeanContext to provide a factory for creating its own BeanContextServices implementations.  This is necessary so that ControlBeanContext objects can avoid locking on the BC.gHL in the JDK and are thus faster.  The implication is that some ControlBean(Context) classes will use CBC objects that don't provide a level of synchronization that is appropriate in all situations.  Application developers that add ControlBeans in unsynchronized contexts should be careful to avoid grafting them into Control hierarchies that require synchronization.", 
   "Yes, this is a little tricky.  :)", 
   "This is a good first cut, but this functionality will clearly need to evolve over time.",
