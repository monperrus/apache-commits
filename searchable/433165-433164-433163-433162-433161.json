   "Fixing the failed tests on the vmbuild machine. Rather than trying to pause for a second and hoping that means the file's will have different timestamps - the new code just sits and creates the new file repeatedly until it has a different timestamp. A pause of a second means that repeatedly should usually be a very small number of times - such as one. Also changed the code so the long millisecond variable is the date's getTime method and not a different time all together. The previous one irritated my sense of aesthetics :)"
