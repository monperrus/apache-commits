   "QPID-1805 : Updated BackingStore to error if we cannot create the backing store. Also updated so that we store the queues evenly over 256 bins, thus giving us the ability to have around 8.1 million actives queues. The Hash function was borrowed from Apache Harmony. Added manual testing to ensure we are not limited by Linux's max file/dir per Inode of 31998. Made the test manual as creating 32000 queues does take a little while."
