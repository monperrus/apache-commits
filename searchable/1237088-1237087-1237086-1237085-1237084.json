   "* Remove remaining references to MINA transport configuration keys: enableDirectBuffers/enablePooledAllocator/filterchain from code and example config files.", 
   "* Remove references to compressBufferOnQueue from config XMLs.  The implementation that used it was removed back in 2007 by QPID-275.", 
   "* Remove references to broker-side configuration key enableJMSXUserID. This broker feature was removed by QPID-943 (which replaced the functionality with an equivilent client-side option). The old Broker side key plays no part in the client-side function."
