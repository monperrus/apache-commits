   "This is a collection of minor component changes, done for consistency.", 
   "* Data is always \"pushed\" into skin parts. We were doing this in some places like ItemsComponent.contentGroup, but not in other places. Affected components are TextInput, TextArea, NumericStepper, and Button.", 
   "* Button (and every subclass) has an optional \"labelField\" SkinPart. The Button \"label\" property is pushed into this part if it is defined.", 
   "* Added skin states to the following components:", 
   "TrackBase (includes H/VScrollBar and H/VSlider): States \"normal\" and \"disabled\".", 
   "Spinner (includes NumericStepper): States \"normal\" and \"disabled\".", 
   "ContainerBase (includes ItemsComponent, Selector, and List): States \"normal\" and \"disabled\".", 
   "The appearance of \"disabled\" states is controlled by the skin. The behavior of \"disabled\" states is still controlled by the component (ie ScrollBar disables the thumb, track and arrow when it is disabled).", 
   "* Added new ContainerBase class, which is the base class for ItemsComponent and DataComponent. The base class manages the skin states and puts up a mouse shield when disabled.", 
   "* Thumb positioning code in slider and scrollbar always rounds to the nearest pixel boundary. Sub-pixel positioning makes the thumbs look blurry.", 
   "* TextView measurement is rounded to integer values. It was commonly returning non-integer values which was causing subsequent components in relative layouts to be positioned on sub-pixel boundaries.", 
   "Bugs: SDK-16933 Make Label be an optional part of Button and related components", 
   "QE: The pixel alignment changes may result in bitmap comparison failures. The bitmaps should be regenerated with the pixel alignment. There should be no functional changes to any of the components.",

DataGroup uses the IList APIs through its dataProvider.  So the equivalent methods are now dataProvider.length, dataProvider, addItem, etc...  This is just the initial split work as there's more to come to get the files up to spec.  We will also have to visit how we deal with graphic elements in DataGroup vs. Group.  For now the implementations are roughly the same.",
