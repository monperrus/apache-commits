   "made changes to properly support moving fragments in and out of nested layout fragments - previously, PortletPlacementContextImpl was not coded properly to deal with nested layouts - now PortletPlacementContextImpl represents a single layout fragment, maintaining a representation of each column in the layout and the set of child fragments in each column - no further depth is maintained, so for a child layout fragment, no information is maintained about its columns or its children (previously, the object tried to do this but it did a very poor of it); made changed to MovePortletAction to allow RemovePortletAction and AddPorletAction to add-to/remove-from nested layouts"
