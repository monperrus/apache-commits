   "Added a new API for MIME multipart package writers. This will eventually replace MIMEOutputUtils for MTOM and SwA (currently only for MTOM).", 
   "Reasons:", 
   "* It will allow us to add an alternative (and more optimized) implementation that is not based on JavaMail.", 
   "* It provides a more flexible (but still simpler) API than MIMEOutputUtils (which imposes too much constraints on how the API is used).", 
   "Also refactored MTOMXMLStreamWriter to use this new API. Note that the relevant methods in MIMEOutputUtils are still there but have been deprecated."
