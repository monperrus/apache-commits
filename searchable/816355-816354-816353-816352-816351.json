   "Modified Windows pre_capture() to not fail the reservation if it fails to delete the reservation users on the first attempt.  Added 2nd attempt to delete users after the pagefile reboot if the 1st attempt failed.  This should fix the problem where image captures fail because a file is held open in the user's profile."
