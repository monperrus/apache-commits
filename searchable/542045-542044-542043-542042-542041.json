   "Fixes TAPESTRY-1513.  Added a new configuration type for BindingSource which controls which binding factory to use based on the name of the property the binding is going to be bound to - if known.  The logic only kicks in when no binding prefix has been specified.", 
   "The point in adding it was so that people can use statements like updateComponents=\"compA, compB\" and have the system automatically resolve the unique clientId for each component specified depending on the context in which the binding is invoked.  Sort of like the clientid: binding only this one kicks in automatically and may be easier for people to understand than throwing another binding type at them."
