   "Added the beginnings of accessibility support for Spark's Window and WindowedApplication.", 
   "The new WindowAccImpl and WindowedApplicationAccImpl classes live in airframework.swc, not spark.swc, because this is where Window and WindowedApplication live. All AIR components for both MX and Spark are in airframework.swc, which gets compiled against airglobal.swc rather than playerglobal.swc in order to get AIR-specific classes like NativeWindow.", 
   "The trunk has AIR 1.5.2, which is the current version. This version has classes like AccessibilityImplementation, but they aren't operational; there is no actual MSAA support. However, AIR 2.0 will support MSAA, so accessibility code compiled against 1.5.2 should start to work in 2.0.",
