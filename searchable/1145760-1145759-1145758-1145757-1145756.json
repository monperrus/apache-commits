   "Also includes all/new/loaded feature computation in JsRequest, as a useful convenience.", 
   "This CL adds support for the supportDefer=\"true\" annotation in <api>. In its presence, the exportJs() calls generated by ExportJsProcessor are augmented to request deferred symbol binding when &jsload=1. This in turn allows support for synchronously enqueueing requests to symbols whose full implementations haven't yet been loaded."
