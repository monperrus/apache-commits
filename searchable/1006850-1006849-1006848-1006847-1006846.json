   "Restructured the mechanism for capturing which objects are dirty, and hence need to be persisted or update in the viewer.  Now a DirtyObjectSet maintains a list of dirty objects and is used by the LocalObjectManager and viewing mechanism to find out which objects have changed.", 
   "Pojos can proactively tell their container that they have changed, so they are added to the dirty object set.  Alternatively they can maintain a dirty flag that the reflector will check when needed.  The first method is more efficient."
