   "allow valid css-2 pseudo-classes, like :hover, to be appended to an icon skinning key. Before this change, if :hover was appended to an icon skinning key, the parser would not consider it an icon anymore, but a style. This sets the stage for renderers to have different icons on mouseover; they would have two keys: af|foo::some-icon and af|foo::some-icon:hover. Then on mouseover, they would use the af|foo::some-icon:hover icon."
