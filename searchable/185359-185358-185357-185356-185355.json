   "Its taking a bit longer than I figured (really!)", 
   "The major changes in design are:", 
   "1. decoupled all the hard-coded logic from J1 into profiling rules", 
   "there is a 'Standard' rule that implements old J1 profiling rules", 
   "there is also a 'RoleFallback' rule that simulates J1 role-based fallback", 
   "(i haven't completed the implementation yet)", 
   "2. Break out the different kinds of profiling rule criteria:", 
   "- standard J1 (pagename, mediatype, language, country, user, role, group)", 
   "- normalized request parameters (in context of portlet api)", 
   "- normalized request attributes (in context of portlet api)", 
   "- normalized request properties (in context of portlet api)", 
   "- normalized user attributes (in context of portlet api)", 
   "- normalized CCPP properties", 
   "- and so on", 
   "3. Profiling is now used to locate both pages and desktops", 
   "The new concept of a desktop will replace and enhance the modules/navigations/layout/page concept from Turbine"
