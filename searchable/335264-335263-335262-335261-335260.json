   "These are changes submitted (offline) by Mukund Raghavachari/Watson/IBM@IBMUS.", 
   "This fixes a bug with match=\"chapter//footnote[1]\" patterns.", 
   "The main change here is minor to remove the automatic attachment of parent::* to simple step patterns.", 
   "He has re-implemented executePredicates to be", 
   "more efficient. Given a pattern such as row[6], it", 
   "does not iterate over the entire axis until it reaches", 
   "the node to see if it is the sixth node. Rather,", 
   "starting from the current node, it works backwards", 
   "(preceding siblings) until it either runs out of nodes", 
   "or finds more than six nodes that match the", 
   "predicate [I can explain it better if desired].", 
   "This optimization improves performance slightly", 
   "overall. It helps decoy and patterns most (by", 
   "about 10%).", 
   "The other optimization that I implemented was the", 
   "following. For a pattern foo[][3][][4] ..., where more", 
   "than one predicate is a number (position check),", 
   "in checking the predicate [4], the fact that the", 
   "current node has passed foo[][3] implies that it is", 
   "the only node that is the third node among its", 
   "siblings that passes foo[]. Therefore, any", 
   "subsequent position checks can be true if and", 
   "only if the position is [1]. This optimization is not", 
   "used by the xsltmark benchmarks and so does", 
   "not offer any performance benefits."
