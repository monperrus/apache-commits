   "Added CreateCommand(IMappedStatement, parameterObject) method to make it easier to create a parameter populated IDbCommand without passing it through the execution and result mapping phases. This method is not a member of the IPreparedCommand interface because it is not a part of the normal execution/result lifecycle. It may be useful in custom execution or testing scenarios."
