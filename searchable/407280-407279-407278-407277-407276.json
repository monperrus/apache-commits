   "Several bug fixes in PCLRenderer (border painting mostly).", 
   "Option in AbstractGraphics2DAdapter to work with or without alpha.", 
   "Text Setup changed to the Java2D model. Custom font painting is now done through Java2D as bitmaps for all fonts which are not supported by the pre-defined set. This was done as a shortcut for full-fledged TrueType support which seems to be a little complicated in PCL. BTW, Microsoft PCL printer drivers do the same, i.e. paint text as bitmaps.", 
   "Image printing refined, but my attempt at handling bitmasked images (transparency) didn't work out. While the previewers did the expected thing, the printer hardware flat-out ignored it, so it's disabled now."
