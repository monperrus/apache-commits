   "Added the suffix -impl to some block dependencies to reflect the standard structure. Also changed version 2.2-SNAPSHOT to 1.0-SNAPSHOT for block dependencies, only cocoon-core has version 2.2. Removed dependencies on cocoon-test-core, that don't exists anymore, the test is part of the cocoon-core following standard Maven idiom. I am not sure if the cocoon-core test classes are available for other modules however, have not tested."
