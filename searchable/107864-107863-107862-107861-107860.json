   "Made the error message when there are no DNS entries more descriptive (used to be 'no route to host', re: bug 8160), moved the setting of the servername property to the run method so it only happens once during initiatization, and cleaned up the exception handling as it was a bit fugly and I think could have explained why certain MessagingExceptions, while having an IOException as the next exception, would still have an immediate failure."
