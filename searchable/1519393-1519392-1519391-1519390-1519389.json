   "Fix Gump failure (hopefully)", 
   "Move the log failure to the adapter so that the logging occurs before the request and response are recycled. This should improve the information that appears in the logs.", 
   "The failure was caused because Gump runs with access logs enabled so when the failure occurred the context had been set to null. This meant the the default access logging kicked in which found the standard host level log and logged the issue there rather than in the context level TesterAccessLog."
