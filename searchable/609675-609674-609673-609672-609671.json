   "Patch from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-722 by Ted Ross:", 
   "Two changes in this patch:", 
   "1) Management object IDs are now persistent for persistent (durable) objects. This is required to provide continuity of historical management data across broker restarts. The format of object IDs now indicates whether they are transient or persistent. The upper bit (bit 63) is 0 for transient IDs and 1 for persistent IDs.", 
   "2) Changes have been made to the management code generator in preparation for allowing it to be used by outside projects that wish to use the broker Plugin API for management access.", 
   "File-by-file notes:", 
   "M python/mgmt-cli/managementdata.py", 
   "Enhanced user-friendly display of 64-bit object IDs to", 
   "differentiate between persistent IDs and non-persistent IDs.",
