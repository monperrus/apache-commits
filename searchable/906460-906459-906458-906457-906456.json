   "QPID-2059 : One of the main causes of SubscriptionLoggingTest failing was that the aynchronous broker call preceding the log scraping would not always have time to complete the logging to file.", 
   "So I have added a waitAndFindMessages method that will attempt to retreive the required string for a set period of time. If it is found then it will perform the findMessages as before. I have updated the LoggingTests to use this method first. This will ensure that we have a more sophoiticated wait that just adding Thread.sleep()s to the tests."
