   "Thread safety fix (list of delegates were modified and copied concurrently without common lock).  The hashtable is thread safe and not published outside the class, so no need to copy it (synchronize non atomic modification is enought).  However, the list contained in the delegates hashtable are published and should thus be copied.  I put the copy in the add method so that the getDelegates doesn't need to be synchronized."
