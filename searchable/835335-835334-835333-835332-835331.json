   "DERBY-4436: Refactor existing in-memory back end tests and add new tests for dropping database.", 
   "Added a new utility class to deal with in-memory databases (convenience methods, much like BaseJDBCTestCase and friends).", 
   "Adjusted existing tests to use MemoryDbManager.", 
   "Added new test DropWhileConnectingTest to study the behavior of Derby when several threads connect and/or execute queries when the database is being shut down. Written primarily to test the upcoming feature for blocking new connections while certain operations are taking place (for instance database shutdown and drop).", 
   "Note: Some features have been disabled in the committed code, awaiting the drop database functionality (DERBY-4428). Some additional changes may also be required.",
