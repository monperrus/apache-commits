   "Update to design. Here's a list of some of those changes:", 
   "1) Added more methods to iterate over structures in the", 
   "Grammar. Also, removed XMLContentSpec since that is", 
   "an implementation detail that shouldn't carry over", 
   "to the generic Grammar model.", 
   "2) Merged the SymbolHasher interface into the SymbolTable", 
   "class. This simplifies the design and makes a big", 
   "difference in performance since we don't have to call", 
   "an interface method which is always slower than calling", 
   "a class method.", 
   "There was some thought to change the content model validator", 
   "but that was reconsidered as being not necessary and too", 
   "much of a hit to performance."
