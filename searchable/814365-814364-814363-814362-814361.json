   "Fixed Parser/Renderer bug that made them allergic to WikiContexts that do not have \"pages\" (e.g., UserPreferences). Because WikiContexts are *not* guaranteed to have pages in 3.0, this was important to fix. Fixed related bug in TranslateTag; we now render the body content by calling RenderingManager directly, rather than inefficiently channeling it through WikiEngine (and looking up nonexistent cached documents, etc.)."
