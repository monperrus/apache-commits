   "In MultiTopicConsumer, when subscribe call is immediately followed by addSubscription call, there's a tiny window where subscribed flag is not turned to true yet but shouldSubscribed flag is true. In that case, MultiTopicConsumer#reSubscribe method was called to add the subscription, but the subscribe message was discarded because subscribed flag was false. Fixed the issue by sending the subscribe message even when the Consumer is not reporting subscribed/connected yet. The message will be queued if the Consumer is not connected yet, and sent when it's connected, or it'll be sent out if it is already connected, so it's safe either way.",
