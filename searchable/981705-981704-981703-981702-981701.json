   "This patch involves the following changes:", 
   "- ProxyHandler and AccelHandler use similar code for handling the headers,", 
   "status codes and rewrite-mime-types. This patch refactors ProxyHandler to use", 
   "the common code placed in UriUtils for all of the above. The", 
   "disallowed-headers-list has also been consolidated into UriUtils.", 
   "- As a side effect of the refactoring, the header names and values will be", 
   "validated (via the UriUtils method) for the ProxyHandler flow as well.", 
   "- A bug in the handling of the \"rewrite-mime-type\" logic has also been fixed", 
   "here. Earlier the response mime type was only checked for its prefix match with", 
   "the rewrite mime type upto the \"/\" marker and not including the \"/\" marker -", 
   "this has been fixed now.", 
   "- Tests have been added for the \"rewrite-mime-type\" handling.",
