   "Change binding-ws-calculator/build.xml to look similar to the way our build files used to look. Relies on launcher.jar to run the sample. Add itest/sample to run the samples automatically. Error handling not working yet. This also relies on distribution/all generating a dir distro to test against. Currently this runs as part of the main build but I see Raymond has now separated distributions from features so we could have this be a distribution test stage."
