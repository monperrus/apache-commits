   "[MINVOKER-95] Restoring the behaviour that exceptions thrown in a post-build hook script result in a build failure", 
   "o In general if a hook script throws an exception, this indicates an error in the hook script and not actually a failure of the test, in fact the test status is indeterminate.  However, in the post-build hook scripts throwing an exception is a good way to provide a meaningful error message.", 
   "o Perhaps a better way to achieve the distinction between post-build hook script errors and post-build hook script identified build failures would be to have the hook script throw an AssertionError, or some other defined exception... however that would require reworking all the existing post-build hook scripts, hence this jump-around"
