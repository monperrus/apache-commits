   "SDM still has a race condition where more added service events are sent than required when rediscovering discarded services.", 
   "ServiceRegistar compliance tests appear to require that services be notified in the same order that those services are registered with a registrar, this isn't documented in the spec,  but may need to be complied with for backward compatibility.  For now Reggie's event notification is single threaded to ensure these tests pass.  TaskManager.Task.runAfter didn't make any direct dependency check for this additional requirement, instead the limited scalability of TaskManager ensured compliance.",
