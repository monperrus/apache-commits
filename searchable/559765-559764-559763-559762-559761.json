   "Made sure the queued message in ProtocolCodecFilter is flushed out when resumeRead() is invoked.  To implement this, SocketIoProcessor and DatagramConnectorDelegate fire a messageReceived event with an empty buffer.  I made sure all filters process it correctly.  It's somewhat a kind of hack, but I though it's very easy to implement and affects only IoFilters."
