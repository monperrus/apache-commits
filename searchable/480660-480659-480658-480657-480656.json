   "Added a control object/callback to the transport to allow other components to provide processing information to the transport.  The modifications in this patch allow the AxisServlet to be notified when a one-way message has be processed far enough to be ack'd as per the specs.  (A similar change, although warranted, was not made to the SimpleHTTPServer, as the API does not seem to provide a means to return a response without unwinding the call stack.)  The quickstart sample was modified to fix a dependency that it had upon fire-and-forget invocations not returning until the one-way message had been completely processed on the server side (at least in the case of Axis2.)"
