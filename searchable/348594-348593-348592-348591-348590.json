   "DERBY-398 -  Bring store tests into J2ME/CDC Foundation testing", 
   "Contributed by Deepa Remesh", 
   "Attaching a patch 'store_patch.diff' for enabling tests (mostly store tests) to run in J2ME. This patch does the following:", 
   "* i18n\\urlLocale.sql, i18n\\urlLocale_app.properties, urlLocale.out - Removed protocol name from URLs and added 'ij.protocol' to app_properties file so that test can run in J2ME. Updated master file.", 
   "* i18n\\DefaultLocale.java - Removed lines to get nested connection from procedure methods since these connections were not used. This was causing failures with JSR169 where nested connections are not supported.", 
   "* i18n\\iepnegativetests_ES_app.properties, iepnegativetests_ES.out - Added 'ij.protocol' to app_properties file so that test can run in J2ME. Updated master file.", 
   "* storetests\\st_1_app.properties, storetests\\st_schema_app.properties, storetests\\st_b5772_app.properties, storetests\\derby94_app.properties - Changed the property 'database' to 'ij.database' in st_schema_app.properties.", 
   "* tools\\ij2_app.properties - Changed the property 'database' to 'ij.database' and added ij.dataSource properties.", 
   "* tools\\ij4_app.properties - Added comment that this test has to be excluded since it is a test for a case with no default driver.", 
   "* tools\\iepnegativetests_app.properties, tools\\iepnegativetests.sql, iepnegativetests.out - Removed protocol name from URLs and added 'ij.protocol' to app_properties file so that test can run in J2ME. Updated master file.", 
   "* tools\\ij_app.properties - Added comment that test is specific to ij and tests bad/good urls", 
   "* testRoutines.sql - To avoid using nested connection, directly called create procedures instead of calling a wrapper which will create the procedures.", 
   "* store\\databaseProperties_app.properties, databaseProperties.out - Changed the master file to match change in testRoutines.sql", 
   "* TestUtil.java - Changed getDataSource method to handle case for EmbeddedSimpleDataSource. Added getDataSourceConnection method which takes a Properties object and returns a connection using the appropriate data source class. This method can be used to boot/shutdown Derby using DataSource.", 
   "* lang\\errorStream_app.properties - This test works with changes to  TestUtil.getDataSource method to handle case for EmbeddedSimpleDataSource.", 
   "* lang\\logStream.java, lang\\logStream_app.properties, logStream.out - Changed to call TestUtil.getDataSourceConnection instead of DriverManager.getConnection", 
   "* lang\\functions_app.properties - Added comment that test is excluded for now since it uses server-side JDBC. This test can be converted to Java test to call only functions which do not use server-side JDBC in JSR169 environment.", 
   "* lang\\releaseCompileLocks_app.properties - Added comment that test uses server-side JDBC", 
   "* store\\backupRestore.sql, store\\backupRestore_app.properties, backupRestore.out -  Removed protocol name from URLs. Updated master file.", 
   "* store\\removeStubs.sql, store\\removeStubs_app.properties, removeStubs.out -  Removed protocol name from URLs. Updated master file.", 
   "* store\\rollForwardBackup_app.properties, store\\rollForwardBackup.sql, rollForwardBackup.out - Removed protocol name from URLs. Updated master file.", 
   "* store\\connectDisconnect_app.properties - This test works after changes for DERBY-597. So just re-enabled it.", 
   "* store\\Beetle6038_app.properties - Added comment that this tests encryption which is not supported in Derby J2ME implementation", 
   "* store\\TestDurabilityProperty.java, store\\TestDurabilityProperty_app.properties - Changed to call TestUtil.getDataSourceConnection instead of DriverManager.getConnection", 
   "* store\\backupRestore1.java, store\\backupRestore1_app.properties - Changed to call TestUtil.getDataSourceConnection instead of DriverManager.getConnection", 
   "* store\\MaxLogNumber_app.properties, store\\MaxLogNumberRecovery_app.properties - Changed the property 'database' to 'ij.database' and added ij.dataSource properties.", 
   "* store\\rollForwardRecovery.sql, store\\rollForwardRecovery_app.properties, rollForwardRecovery.out - Removed protocol name from URLs. Updated master file.", 
   "* store\\logDevice_app.properties - This test works after changes for DERBY-597. So just re-enabled it.", 
   "* lang\\closed.java, lang\\closed_app.properties - Added catch for NoSuchMethodError for DatabaseMetadata.getURL method. Skips 'shutDownTest' if it is JSR169. I think I can change this to use TestUtil.getDataSourceConnection for shutdown test. I noticed this when writing this down and so will submit this in my next patch.", 
   "* j9_foundation\\closed.out - Added new master to handle DatabaseMetadata.getURL", 
   "* j9_foundation\\ij2.out - Added new master because of difference in output of show connections in J2ME.", 
   "Ran derbyall with this patch using Sun JDK 1.4.2 and j9_foundation in IBM WCTME 5.7. No new failures.",
