   "1. Initial Mac OS X support for Squiggle.  The screen menu bar is now used", 
   "instead of menus on each browser window.  The build process now includes", 
   "a script (lib/make-squiggle-app.sh) in the binary distributions which", 
   "creates an application bundle for easy installation.  It also affords", 
   "better OS X integration, by customizing the application name in the", 
   "application menu and the dock, and provides a dock icon.", 
   "The user still must run this script manually after unzipping the", 
   "distribution, though, so it's not ideal, but it's better than including", 
   "a whole Squiggle.app directory with the duplicated .jar files in it", 
   "(and it doesn't seem to warrant having a separate download)."
