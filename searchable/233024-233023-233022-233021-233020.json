   "o Added @requiresDirectInvocation (was: @cliOnly, but this implies m2 is run from CLI...counter-intuitive for embedding)", 
   "o Added handling for new @requiresDirectInvocation (generation/parsing, MojoDescriptor support, etc.)", 
   "o Added check in DefaultLifecycleExecutor to throw a LifecycleExecutionException if a mojo specified in a lifecycle binding is marked as direct-invocation only.", 
   "o Added MavenProjectHelper/DefaultMavenProjectHelper to provide convenience methods for manipulating MavenProject instances (for example, attaching artifacts or adding resources)", 
   "o Removed maven-artifact dependency from maven-source-plugin, and added dependency on maven-plugin-api (should've been there)"
