   "VCL-550", 
   "Added post_reserve subroutine to Windows.pm. It runs $SYSTEMROOT/vcl_post_reserve.cmd if this file exists. Added general run_script subroutine which writes the script output to C:\\cygwin\\home\\root\\VCL\\Logs. Also added format_text_file subroutine which runs unix2dos. All of the unix2dos commands can eventually be migrated to use this subroutine.", 
   "VCL-450", 
   "Added Windows.pm::get_cpu_core_count. This will be used by provisioning modules to check if the loaded computer (mainly VMs) have the correct number of CPUs after being loaded. Some versions of Windows don't detect CPUs in addition to the number that existed on the computer which was used to capture the image until rebooted. This will allow the provisioning module to detect this and reboot the computer after loading it if necessary.", 
   "Other", 
   "Added missing 'Windows Server 2003 R2' key to setup_product_keys so that this option appears when capturing a base image via 'vcld --setup'.", 
   "Removed command to run 'slmgr.vbs -ato' from Version_6.pm::run_slmgr_skms. It was being run twice."
