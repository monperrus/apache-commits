   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",

We add back the target objects into the initial state for the duration of the effect, then remove it when finished. RemoveAction will still work if removal needs to be explicitly choreographed, but a simple Fade will at least do the job now.",
