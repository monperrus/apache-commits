   "isSet() is a little different to what I had interpreted it to be - I have altered the Javadoc slightly to reflect this.  I have reverted my earlier change since it was causing required fields to be invalid when initially created.  The getSafeEmptyValue() concept contained a problem that was causing NPEs - this was only apparent when the previously mentioned change was reverted.  Added more test cases."
