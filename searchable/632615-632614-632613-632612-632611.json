   "Reverted the JSP changes from my last commit so that existing 2.6 deployments don't need to reconfigure web.xml. That commit removed the fmt:setBundle tag because of the addition of a servlet config parameter in web.xml. The web.xml modifications remain, however, so that any new JSPs won't need to use setBundle. For 2.8, we will remove the setBundle tags entirely."
