   "Patch from Jonathan Colwell - \"parameter and result namespaces\"", 
   "=============== Notes from Jonathan ===================", 
   "I found that the while the parameter and return value namespaces", 
   "specified by OperationDesc.getReturnQName() and ParamDesc.getQName()", 
   "would show up the in SOAP messages, the WSDL for my Doc/Lit/Wrapped", 
   "service said nothing about them.  Since I'm working on an implementation", 
   "of JSR-181 (Web Service Metadata) and that spec dictates that WSDL be", 
   "able to display this namespace, I have put together the attached patch", 
   "modifying Emitter.java and Types.java in the", 
   "org.apache.axis.wsdl.fromJava package.", 
   "Within Types.java I have simply overloaded", 
   "writeWrappedParameter(Element, String, QName, Class) to take a QName for", 
   "the second parameter writeWrappedParameter(Element, QName, QName, Class)", 
   "thus preserving compatibility with exiting code.", 
   "There was a comment in Emitter.java indicating that the author had", 
   "considered using QName rather than just the LocalPart so perhaps there", 
   "is a legitimate reason not to use QNames here, but the fix appears to", 
   "satisfy what the 181 spec is looking to accomplish.  I have not yet", 
   "checked whether other areas of the wsdl.fromJava code could make use of", 
   "a similar change and until it is decided that this change is worth", 
   "making, there is no sense messing with a bunch of other functions.",
