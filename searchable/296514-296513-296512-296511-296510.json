   "- Fix a problem where the content-lenght calculated would be incorrect. The", 
   "bug only happend when using a writer and the total response length was", 
   "between 8K and 16K (since there's a buffer for bytes, and one for chars).", 
   "This would cause the response to get truncated, as the content-length", 
   "would get set to 8K.", 
   "Now, the char buffer is flushed first, and if the response is still not committed", 
   "the content-length will be set.", 
   "- Thanks to Jon Stevens for testing with Scarab (which looks quite good and", 
   "appears to work fine with that patch)."
