   "Problem:", 
   "Java2WSDL uses the BeanSerializer writeSchema to write out the schema for an Exception class.", 
   "This is done because Exception classes share a lot of processing with Beans...including", 
   "the presences of meta data.", 
   "The problem is that the BeanPropertyDescriptors that are built only contain the", 
   "editable properties.  For Exceptions, the BeanPropertyDescriptor needs to contain", 
   "the read-only properties as well.  The JSR 101 specification indicates that", 
   "the elements within a complexType for a Fault are mapped to read-only properties in an Exception;", 
   "thus Java2WSDL needs to consider the read-only properties when generating the wsdl.", 
   "Solution:", 
   "Code is added BeanUtils to add the read-only properties if the indicated class", 
   "is Throwable.", 
   "I also cleaned up the code a little...probably could use more cleanup.  Added", 
   "some additional exception handling.", 
   "I made a small change to the Roundtrip testcase to verify the problem and the fix.", 
   "NOTE: THIS FIX IS REQUIRED TO PASS A TCK TEST.",
