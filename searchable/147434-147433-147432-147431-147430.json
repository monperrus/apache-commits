   "* Reoganized the SqlBuilder code a bit to make it easier to derive and use.",

   "* the basic Oracle, MSSql, MySql and Sybase builders seem to work fine now", 
   "* added licences to code", 
   "* moved the Ant tasks which depend on Velocity/Texen into a seperate package, so its easy to know which Ant tasks can be used with just commons code and which requires Velocity/Texen", 
   "Right now I don't think the Velocity tasks are working on the new commons-sql model."
