   "NakedObjectReflector, NakedObjectPersistor and NakedObjectConfiguration all injected via constructor or setter-based injection wherever possible (constructor preferred); moved NakedObjectConfiguration, UpdateNotifier and MessageBroker interfaces up from nof.core (since all indirectly referenced by ContainerInjector) and added corresponding *Aware and *Provider interfaces to assist with setter-based dependency injection when needed; moved the listener and event firing stuff out of NakedObject/PojoAdapter and into EventFiring interface and EventFiringPojoAdapter"
