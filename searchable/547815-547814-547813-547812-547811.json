   "Slightly friendlier development mode class factory that dumps the javassist class pool on each reset.  Results in fix of majority of major memory leaks in dev mode + reduction of many megs of those leaks.   Only major culprit left is OgnlRuntime and I don't think that's going to be a problem to fix. ;)"
