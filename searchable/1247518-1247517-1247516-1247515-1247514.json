   "Switch html wrappers over to using swfobject.  There is only one copy of the template file index.template.html and swfobject.js in templates\\swfobject.  For now, until I9 when we get sync'ed with FlexBuilder, the build will generate each flavor of the template and deposit them in the usual directory structure, client-side-detection, express-installation, no-player-detection, and *-with-history directories, as expected by FlexBuilder.  The old tokens which FlexBuilder and the html-wrapper task use to substitute values are still being used.",
