   "Major overhaul of mod_negotiation.c.", 
   "- cleanups to mod_negotiation comments and code structure", 
   "- made compliant with HTTP/1.1 proposed standard (rfc2068) and added", 
   "support for everything in the upcoming HTTP/1.1", 
   "revision (draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-06.txt).", 
   "- language tag matching also handles tags with more than 2", 
   "levels like x-y-z", 
   "- empty Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Charset headers are", 
   "processed correctly; previously an empty header would make all", 
   "values acceptable instead of unacceptable.", 
   "- allowed for q values in Accept-Encoding", 
   "- added support for transparent content negotiation (rfc2295 and", 
   "rfc2296) (though we do not implement all features in these drafts,", 
   "e.g. no feature negotiation).  Removed old experimental version.", 
   "- implemented 'structured entity tags' for better cache correctness", 
   "(structured entity tags ensure that caches which can deal with Vary", 
   "will (eventually) be updated if the set of variants on the server", 
   "is changed)", 
   "- this involved adding a vlist_validator element to request_rec", 
   "- this involved adding the ap_make_etag() function to the global API", 
   "- modified guessing of charsets used by Apache negotiation algorithm", 
   "to guess 'no charset' if the variant is not a text/* type", 
   "- added code to sort multiviews variants into a canonical order so that", 
   "negotiation results are consistent across backup/restores and mirrors", 
   "- removed possibility of a type map file resolving to another type map", 
   "file as its best variant",
