   "- I had not understood the purpose of AspectC which is not to generated final weaved code but only to weave the custom javadoc tags onto the aspects themselves. We still need to call AspectWerkzC afterwards for offline weaving onto the main source code.", 
   "- Next step is to add support for 2 source paths: one being the main runtime sources and another being where non-production aspects are located (optional)."
