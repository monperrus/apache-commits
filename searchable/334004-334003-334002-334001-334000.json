   "Fixed bug where the waiting list of walkers were not being cloned.  Fix", 
   "was made by defining a cloneDeep function on AxesWalker, and", 
   "handing it in a Vector to which is added the original-clone pairs.", 
   "Each clone operation checks to see if it is on the list, and, if so,", 
   "uses the already cloned object, otherwise it clones itself and adds", 
   "its pair to the list.  This has more expense than I would like, but", 
   "is safe.", 
   "Also made many member variables transient, in order to work towards", 
   "the ability to serialize the iterators (this was done so that a given", 
   "iterator could be serialized and then checked against another", 
   "serialization after an clone and execute operation to see", 
   "what had changed.  This debugging technique kind of worked!)"
