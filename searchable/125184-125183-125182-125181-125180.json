   "Added support for persisting listener relationships, and persistence delegate classes for generated adaptors.   There is now a checkin test that encodes to XML, then decodes from XML a control containing two nested controls, some non-default state, and several listener relationships.   After decode, some basic tests are made to see if state/relationships have been preserved."
