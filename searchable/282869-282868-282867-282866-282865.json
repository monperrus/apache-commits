   "- Replaced the \"newSessionRequest\" hook with 2 other hooks: findSession", 
   "and sessionState. This allow modules to control most aspects of session", 
   "processing.", 
   "- Servlet22Interceptor now corectly handles servlet-specific aspects of", 
   "session management - binding events, etc. That happens for both", 
   "expired sessions and reloading.", 
   "- Small improvement in reloading: we'll set a context note with the old", 
   "class loader, and on session reloading we replace only the objects loaded", 
   "with the old loader. That means an object that is loaded with the main", 
   "class loader ( like DatabaseConnection ) will be valid after reload.",

   "Another small change: if the module implements \"registerHooks\", it'll", 
   "be allowed to register the hooks itself, instead of using the automated", 
   "code in Hooks. That means it can insert itself in front, end or after", 
   "another module ( apache 2.0 style ) - by default the modules are inserted", 
   "automatically at the end."
