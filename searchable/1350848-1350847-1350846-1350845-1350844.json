   "[HBASE-6212] [0.89-fb] support disabling wals at a per table level", 
   "Author: aaiyer", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Unicorn use case wants to disable WAL's to improve throughput. They", 
   "are able to do so in Java, but the C++ workflow to diable WALs is still", 
   "in progress.", 
   "Disabling WALs should be possible with a table-wide/cluster-wide setting", 
   "as well. We could disable WALs in the cluster (at the HRegionServer level);", 
   "but, that would also disable WALs to .META. and other tables that may not", 
   "have the same properties.", 
   "Having a per table setting allows us to disable WALs for the specific use", 
   "cases that don't care about the additional guarantees that WAL provides.", 
   "Test Plan:", 
   "run unit tests on MR:", 
   "Existing unit test pass.", 
   "TBD:", 
   "add a unit test that", 
   "(i) creates 2 tables.", 
   "one with WAL disabled, and one without disabling WALS.", 
   "(ii) do a bunch of mutations: puts and deletes", 
   "(iii) check that whenever we do puts/deletes to table 1, the number of", 
   "entries in the HLog increases. But, not so for puts/deletes to table 2.",
