   "The encoding in the sample junit-noframes XSL stylesheet was set to be \"US-ASCII\". It is now set to \"UTF-8\". Apparently, XSLT processors are only required to support utf-8 and utf-16, the rest is processor specific. For example your processor might spupport US-ASCII-7 and others might support US-ASCII. Thanks to Robert Koberg for the explanation!"
