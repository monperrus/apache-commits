   "Fixed bug where ProductStore.headerApprovedStatus wasn't working because the check item status service was always setting it to approved; not sure when how this happened, but it seems to be related to a weird way of setting the order header status to approved by setting all item statuses; changed the orderdetail page in the order manager to use changeOrderStatus instead of changeOrderItemStatus, and also changed changeOrderStatus to support setting item statuses first if parameter for that is passed; this fixes the ProductStore.headerApprovedStatus problem, and hopefully won't have an impact on other areas; in the check order item status there is only a small reason why it won't auto approve the header, mainly for the headerApprovedStatus case and it checks specifically for that"
