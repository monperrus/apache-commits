   "Allow the build properties to be overridden for test by using an overriding test properties file.", 
   "properties in test.properties will be used to override the properties in the build.properties file.", 
   "as a result of the order the properties are read in the properties need to be copied with propertycopy to override certain properties.", 
   "by default no properties are set so no changes are required by anyone, but these changes allow for the properties to be overridden", 
   "so the testing can be done after the build and packaging step and the testing done against only the packaged deliverable and not reference any items in the build tree."
