   "protected function partAdded(partName:String, instance:Object):void", 
   "Technically this just means we can't support the value of \"undefined\" anymore.  This change was made to partAdded(), partRemoved(), createPartInstance(), removePartInstance(), and getDyanamicPartAt().", 
   "As I was making these changes in all the files that override these methods, I noticed Slider should have a partRemoved() method, so I added it.", 
   "I also made a minor change in Selector where there was a bug in the dataProvider collectionChange eventHandler.  Basically we were doing remove code on replace rather than remove.",
