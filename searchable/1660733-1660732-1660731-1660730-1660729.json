   "DISPATCH-116: Qpid dispatch management tools do not use SSL and SASL correctly.", 
   "Added support for SSL connections from qdmanage and qdstat tools.",

   "for existing and future tools.", 
   "Common options are:", 
   "Connection Options:", 
   "-b URL, --bus=URL   URL of the messaging bus to connect to (default 0.0.0.0)", 
   "-r ROUTER-ID, --router=ROUTER-ID", 
   "Router to be queried", 
   "-t SECS, --timeout=SECS", 
   "Maximum time to wait for connection in seconds (default 5)", 
   "--ssl-certificate=CERT", 
   "Client SSL certificate (PEM Format)", 
   "--ssl-key=KEY       Client SSL private key (PEM Format)",

   "amqp://user:password@host - PLAIN mechanism", 
   "The tools will add anonymous@ if no user is present to force the use of SASL as this",

   "explicit configuration, and SASL connections will always work.",

   "additional mechanisms are specified."
