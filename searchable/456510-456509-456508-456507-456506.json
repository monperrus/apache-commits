   "Added updateCluster boolean to RequestCycle.  As a request is parsed, this boolean is set in order to determine if the end of the request cycle should update the cluster.  In WebRequestCycle, if the resourceReference call returns true, there was a bug where parseRequest would return true, which is incorrect.  Now, resourceReference() and staticContent() both return false (since they don't involve pages).   In addition, both set the updateCluster boolean to false.  Then each of bookmarkablePage, callComponentListener and homePage() set updateCluster to true.  Finally, in Page.onRedirect, updateCluster is set to false to override the true value set in callComponentListener for simple page redirects."
