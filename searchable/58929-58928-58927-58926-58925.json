   "Several users (especially those building jk/ant) had observed that", 
   "the APR 0.9 files didn't match on Win32 - they were explicitly trying", 
   "to locate and bind to libapr-0.dll (to match unix libapr-0.so.)  While", 
   "binary compatibility prevented us from 'fixing' this discrepancy for", 
   "our existing users - nothing prevents us from fixing this going forwards.", 
   "This change allows us to locate APR 0.9 and 1.0 binaries and libraries", 
   "in the same tree structure, as an added bonus.  It would also allow the", 
   "APR library to be installed in a common location, such as \\windows\\system32,", 
   "without introducing conflicts between 0.9 and 1.0.", 
   "Also note that this patch resorts a number of generated files in MSVC 6's", 
   "natural order."
