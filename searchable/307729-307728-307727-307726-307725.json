   "* added logger precision support to chainsaw as a panel preference - similar to patternlayout's c{x}", 
   "* beginning work on expression builder event context popup", 
   "* example: define expression \"logger == \", hit ctrl-space, and a popup is displayed containing all of the the loggers which exist in the tab's set of events (which can then be inserted into the expression)", 
   "* increased visibility of accessor methods to enable context popup", 
   "* added 'modelexists' method on eventtypentrycontainer to determine which logging event fields can provide a context popup"
