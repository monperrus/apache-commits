   "Added a method to check whether the deployment task is running. If an Axis2 server is shutdown while the deployment task is running, there can be exceptions that are thrown. So. in a graceful shutdown scenario, we can first check whether the deployment task is running, and then initiate the shutdown procedure, once the task has ended."
