   "Enhancement: user profile JSPs no longer request a distinct wiki name when a user registers. The wiki name is now computed automtically; it is the user name without any whitespace. This change should make registration even easier. In the various user manager/database classes, UserProfile/DefaultUserProfile.setWikiName() is hereby deprecated and will be removed in a future release. However, getWikiName() remains, as does the UserDatabase method findByWikiName(). The UserDatabase classes do not change their public APIs, and they still persist WikiNames so that they can be searched. However, when UserManager loads a profile from the UserDatabase, it always re-computes the wiki name."
