   "Complete, radical overhaul of the standard CSS jspwiki.css. It is organized (!) and significantly trimmed back from its former sprawling self. Note the new <div> classes \"error\" \"information\" and \"warning\". These have been substituted into one-timer classes like \"versionnote\". The styles, overall, have had most of the rough edges rubbed out... not perfect but it's a start -- not all of Dirk's recommendations made it in."
