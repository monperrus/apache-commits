   "-) Refactored most of the concurrent sensitive hot spot portions of the framework to use the more robust libraries provided by the backport util library - eventually resuliting in roughly 80-90% cold startup time performance in contructing and initializing a sample page. (workbench table page, with 4 simultaneous jmeter threads hitting it on a quad core cpu )", 
   "-) Upgraded most of the common libraries used by the framework.", 
   "-) Fixed race condition with AbstractEngine initializing common shared services and dumping them in servlet context...which under certain conditions could cause those shared resources to be created for each concurrent thread hitting a cold started app."
