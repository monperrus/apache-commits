   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES-2721", 
   "The transport layer part is now cleaned up, almost all functionality now is in Transport.js which is implementation specific", 
   "the ajax request object now is a plain request object (well not entirely yet, but very close, the last functionality soon will be moved outside)", 
   "The entire error handling aspect has improved to a big degree now, we have unified error messages in most areas,", 
   "the errors are enabled on level ERROR (used to be disabled)", 
   "but there is still room for improvement.", 
   "Unfortunately there is not too much I can do regarding the final filesizes without sacrificing readability, or functionality.", 
   "Since the server side gzipped file is around 17KB while our runtime jsf.js file is 70Kbyte (Mojarras is probably around 30) kbyte", 
   "we have some tradeoff, but on the other hand I think the long term maintainability is way better in our", 
   "environment, especially if other transport mechanisms are plugged in soon."
