   "Improved implementation of the ControlClientAnnotationProcessor (responsible for @Control handling) to make it possible to reference bean types that will be generated by the current processor pass.  The CCAP is now able to map from a field (bean) type back to the associated control interface using either compiled class info or from the set of interfaces included on the apt input list.  The effectively removes the need for the 'compileByExtension' <apt> ant task option, which existed primarily to help resolve dependency ordering issues.   As a test case, the controls/test build.xml, which previously relied heavily upon compileByExtension usage and multiple <apt> invocations, now uses neither.", 
   "Added proper handling of the noCompile option to <apt> ant task to cause annotation processing/codegen but disable compilation.   Patch submitted by Chris Hogue."
