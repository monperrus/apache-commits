   "Fix for the buggy behavior of proxy_ftp.c which would return incorrect links", 
   "for \"..\" directory entries , depending on the fact whether the request", 
   "contained a trailing slash or not.",

   "clickable path components which makes traversal of public ftp servers much",

   "0) add appropriate cache control headers to prevent caches from keeping", 
   "sensitive documents (user:password@)", 
   "1) make clickable header optional (\"ProxyOptions +ClickHeader\"", 
   "2) return an external redirection if proxy_ftp detects a directory but the", 
   "request did not contain a trailing slash (that would make the current BASE", 
   "HREF= header field obsolete which in turn would allow the removal of the", 
   "last occurrence of the \"user:password@\" prefix from the generated document).", 
   "3) return a 401 authenticate reply if the addressed ftp server requires a", 
   "user name (other than \"anonymous\") or a password (other than \"apache@\"),", 
   "unless the request contained a WWW-Authenticate: header already.", 
   "4) Optionally convert requests ftp://user:password@host/ on-the-fly into",

   "publishing passwords thru use of log file analyzers.",
