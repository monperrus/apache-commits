   "o Integrating the patch provided by Rakesh Midha", 
   "o The Problem is caused by first update operation. The first time hot-deployer tries to update the changes, it redeployes the application which means the application configid is changes. This change is not reflected in hotdeployer list. Which mean next time any operation is done on this application hotdeployer fails because the application configid being used doesn't exist now.", 
   "o Instead of void the fileUpdated method of DirectoryHotDeployer.java now returns new configId as string, and in DirectoryMonitor.java this configId is updated in actions fileinfo."
