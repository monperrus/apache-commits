   "give returnHTMLPageWithBuffer a buffer length parameter.  The CAD GETs were", 
   "the slowest part of the SPECWeb99 workload.  oprofile showed tons of cycles", 
   "in two strlen()s determining the size of the buffer, which could be up to 92K.", 
   "customadscan now calls returnHTMLPageWithBuffer because it already has the", 
   "length.  returnHTMLPageWithMessage now does a strlen, which should be OK", 
   "since it is used for relatively short error messages.", 
   "This improves 100% CAD GETs from 117 to 127 conforming connections on wimp."
