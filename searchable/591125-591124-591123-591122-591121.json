   "[UIMA-607]Change the PearAnalysisEngineWrapper to reuse resource managers it creates, where the classPath, dataPath, and \"application\" are the same.  This typically arises when running a CPM pipeline with replication.  An application is the set of components using the same outside-of-the-pear resource manager.  A weak hash-map is used to map from this outside-of-the-pear resource manager to the created resource manager for this pear, so that when the application finishes (and is GC'ed) these resources are GC'd too.  This won't happen for the special case where no external resource manager is being used (in this case, the outside-of-the-pear resource manager is \"null\"), but that's OK, since multiple applications are not being run in the same JVM in this case, anyway."
