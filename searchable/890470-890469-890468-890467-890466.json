   "Added call_post_load_custom() sub to Linux.pm. It checks if /etc/init.d/post_load_custom exists and executes it after an image is loaded. This allows an image creator to easily add a custom script which automatically executes on image load. This functionality already exists for Windows.", 
   "Added $NODE_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY class variable to Linux.pm to match Windows.pm.", 
   "Also added subroutine headers to Linux.pm where they were missing but did not populate the information."
