   "Added code to detect when a Type 1 font is not configured to use its native encoding. In such a case it needs to be re-encoded in PostScript. That used to always happen in earlier FOP versions but since support was added for all glyphs in a font, this has become a problem. So this change restores the behaviour of before when XML font metrics files or just the PFM are used."
