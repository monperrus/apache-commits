   "applying TUSCANY-1429 patch,  but I decided to alter the api rather than deprecate it since it has never been exposed in a release, so it would be a shame to publish a brand new API with deprecations in it.  When the commit is ported to the trunk, then the half a dozen references that are made to the old style of the API from within SCA will need to be fixed."
