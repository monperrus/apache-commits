   "[HBASE-6981] Multiple hlog per region server", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary:", 
   "In order to take full advantage of the aggregate throughput from multiple disks, hbase can keep multiple hlog files open and let each region append/sync to one of them.", 
   "From the initial benchmark on the single region server, this diff helps to improve the write throughput by 3X, from 100MB/sec to 300MB/sec", 
   "Test Plan: Tested on the dev cluster",
