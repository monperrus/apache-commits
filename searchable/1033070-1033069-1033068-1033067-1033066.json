   "Updated pom.xml so that it copies dependencies into local lib/java dir, where they can be referenced by run.sh. Unfortunately, due to version numbers being a part of the file name in the jar, this means we need to be a bit clever in the script, which is something that is not simple to do in MS batch, so I've had to temporarily delete the broken batch frontend. Also began exploring the possibility of using maven exec plugin as front-end, but this would require some refactoring to the rhino frontend with respect to how the arguments are passed in. Finally, updated README.txt so it is actually accurate again."
