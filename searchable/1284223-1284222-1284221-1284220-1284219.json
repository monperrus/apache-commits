   "Fix for SDK-16608 and SDK-16445, plus Animation API cleanup.", 
   "I've removed the class and concept of IAnimationTarget, which was a duplicate, and more direct, way of listening to animation events. But to simplify the API, I've eliminated the target concept and, instead, require users of Animation to add themselves as listeners to the various AnimationEvent event types. This fixed SDK-16445 because final values were not being sent to targets, although they were being sent to event listeners (which Animate and other new effects benefit from now).", 
   "This also fixes SDK-16608, which was caused by assuming that any target of Fade must have the 'visible' property, which is not necessarily the case (such as for the Fill object).",

   "First checkin for the \"Arbitrary Type Interpolation\" feature. This feature has a rewritten Tween class (now named flex.effects.Animation). This class supports the old Tween capabilities, but adds functionality such as the ability to supply alternate interpolation objects (to allow animation of non-Number types), a new Easing API, and new 'repeat behavior' that will allow terser looping or reversing animations. The existing new effects were slightly changed to use the new Animation class (instead of Tween), and the superclass of the new effects, AnimateProperties (renamed 'Animate'), is now a subclass of Effect (not TweenEffect).", 
   "Added various new interpolation and easing classes, along with the new packages flex.effects.interpolation and flex.effects.easing. Also added new color-interpolation effect, 'Tint'.", 
   "Expect slight tweaks to the API during i7, but the bulk of the functionality and API changes are being checked in now.",
