   "1.  Updating selector and servlet initializers based on suggestions by Ceki.  Also made them comply with checkstyle....except for InitServlet.java which has an init() method that is over the length limit recommended by the Sun coding standards.  However, this is somewhat unavoidable so I left it that way.", 
   "2.  Updating build.xml to create log4j-sandbox-selector-[versions].jar and log4j-sandbox-servlet-[version].jar.  Also moved a path, which both of the jalopy targets require, outside the single target so both targets can use it.  Also updated the jalopy targets to depend on the \"init\" target like all the other targets in the build.", 
   "3.  Updating sunCodingConvention.xml with additions agreed upon by Mark Womack.",
