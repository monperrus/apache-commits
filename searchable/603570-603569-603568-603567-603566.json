   "Reverted changes done by Jacopo in rev 603506 which was a temporary fix for the problem described there; the real problem appears to be that code, in poss;the real problem seems to be that a variable was retained somewhere in a loop where it should not have been, and to fix that I made 2 changes: in the receiveInventoryProduct simple-method I changed it to use the parameters.inventoryItemId variable for input only, and it isn't set and used inside the loop, instead the new currentInventoryItemId variable is used; also in the quickReceiveReturn simple-method I add a clear-field of receiveCtx to make sure that stale data does not remain between iterations over return items; I don't have a good test case for this, so please take a look at it Jacopo, and it might be good to find a automated test case for this in the near future as this is fairly complicated and error prone code"
