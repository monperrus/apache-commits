   "Fixed problem with a requester that utilized an async callback for req/rsp hanging if transmission of the request failed.  The AxisEngine will now invoke the registered Callback's onError(...) method unless a property is set on the MessageContext to stop that from occurring.  (The property allows RM to disable this behavior, as it's really not desirable in that case.)"
