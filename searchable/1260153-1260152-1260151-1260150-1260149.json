   "Adding new SetAction effect, plus minor improvements to effects overall. This new effect combines the old SetPropertyAction and SetStyleAction effects, figuring out for the named property whether it is a property or a style of the target object. Also, added new capabilities to Animation class and fixed some problems with easing default values.",
