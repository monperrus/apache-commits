   "[UIMA-1756] Add aggregator pom at the top for convenience in rebuilding all the parent poms.  Add parent pom for multi-module distributions.  Change docbook parent to use uima-helper-plugin to get month and year (inserted into docbook results as the \"publication date\".  Use standard dependency unpack goals instead of antrun, since that goal does the right thing with respect to not overwriting newer files.  Add marker files to avoid running parent poms when building just them.  Add a parent pom for binary packaging of single projects.  Move default running of assembly plugin for distr projects out of top."
