   "AVRO-751. C: Store schema reference in datum instances", 
   "We now keep track of which particular schema an avro_datum_t is an", 
   "instance of.  For primitive values, there's only one possible schema,", 
   "and so we don't store an explicit reference.  For compound values, the", 
   "datum constructors now take in a schema parameter, which is stored in", 
   "the avro_datum_t instance.  For records, enums, and fixeds, this means", 
   "that we don't need to store the name of the schema type anymore, since", 
   "we can get this from the schema.", 
   "There were also several functions, which operate on datum instances,", 
   "which needed to take in a schema parameter \u2014 avro_datum_to_json, as an", 
   "example.  Those parameters aren't needed anymore, since the datum", 
   "carries a reference to its own schema already."
