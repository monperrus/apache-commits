   "o Added the check for user's B-tree. Currently, we are only checking the b-tree header and the b-tree info.", 
   "o The updateCheckedPages has been changed to not generate an exception when a page has already been seen, as this will occur many times : first the info page is shared between all the b-trees, second many pages will be shared between two versions of a b-tree.", 
   "Bottom line, we have to change the way we show the checked pages, bits are not enough (it would be better to have a page counter)"
