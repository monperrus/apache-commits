   "To support pre 10.5 databases in soft upgrade mode, the Clob stream header generator can generate both the new header format and the old one.", 
   "Note that the Clob header generator depends on either knowing up front if it is being used in soft upgrade mode, or to be able to determine this through a database context.",
