   "Removed a bunch of dependencies of Owasp Esapi classes after I realized (by studying the Esapi source files and the integration in OFBiz) that we were using a small part of that product; this made it possible to upgrade to the latest release of Owasp Esapi (2.1.0) without having to include a bunch of jars.", 
   "I had to comment out two lines in the unit tests because they were failing after the upgrade; still investigating on this.", 
   "This commit resolves OFBIZ-5343."
