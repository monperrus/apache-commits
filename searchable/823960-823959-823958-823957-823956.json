   "AxisServlet wraps the ServletOutputStream in a BufferedOutputStream but doesn't care to flush the BufferedOutputStream, and thus relies on the message formatter to do so. This however is not a requirement specified by the MessageFormatter interface and is also a difference with respect to other transports that manage the output stream properly.", 
   "This patch changes AxisServlet to properly flush any buffered data and solves the issue described in [1].",
