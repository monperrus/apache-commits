   "Added a runtime check for ImageWriter to verify that it will be functional when used. Example: There's no TIFF codec in the Sun JDK. You have to include the JAI Image I/O tools in the classpath to get TIFF support. With this change the ImageWriterRegistry automatically falls back to the internal TIFF codec if there's no Image I/O TIFF codec."
