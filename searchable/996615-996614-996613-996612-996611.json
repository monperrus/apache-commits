   "Added full System32 path to all .exe calls in the Windows modules.  There were problems with some utilities such as qwinsta.exe being run on 64-bit versions of Windows.  The full path wasn't specified and the utility only resided in the %Sysnative% directory.  This resulted in the .exe not being found.",

   "Updated Windows.pm::delete_File::Basename() to run faster.  All of the commands to set the owner, permissions, and delete the file are now concatenated and sent as a single SSH command rather than several different SSH commands.", 
   "Reworked Windows.pm::reg_query() to return a single value if the value argument is specified or a hash if it isn't specified."
