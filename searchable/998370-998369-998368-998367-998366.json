   "Added 2 stage verification to the DKIMVerifier (JDKIM-23)", 
   "Now BodyHasher is a simpler interface (just getOutputStream exposed) and DKIMVerifier/DKIMSigner cast the BH to the concrete implementation they know they provided to the client in order to get \"memento\" data.", 
   "DKIMVerifier now exposes a method to initialize the verification process from an \"Header\" object, returning a BodyHasher when the client can write the message body and then call the verifier again passing the \"computed\" bodyhasher."
