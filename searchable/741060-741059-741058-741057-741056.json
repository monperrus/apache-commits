   "Fix the problem with the distributions overwriting each other by merging the two assembly plugin configs in to one. That has some implications - the itests need the dir distribution so the distributions need to be built all the time not just with the distribution profile, so the assembly builds are moved to the default profile. To get it to work had to change appendAssemblyId to true so the dir distribution folder name changed again and the samples using that updated to match"
