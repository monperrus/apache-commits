   "Fix various problems identified with flushing batched messages:", 
   "- Flush triggered by disabling batching failed to flip buffer before writing and also failed to clear the buffer after writing was complete. This resulted in duplicated and/or corrupted messages.", 
   "- The flush triggered by session close was too late since no writes are permitted once the close process starts. This resulted in an exception being thrown."
