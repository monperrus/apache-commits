   "Major refactoring of UserPreferences.jsp. The separate registration page is now *gone* and merged into the prefs page. The prefs page itself now has tabs -- one for the user profile, and one for prefs. This means we can relax a few of the security assumptions at the JSP level, since they are already baked into the core UserManager APIs. (Addresses Dirk's requests.)"
