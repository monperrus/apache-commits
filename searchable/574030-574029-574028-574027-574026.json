   "Moved ObjectModelTemplate.xml and ObjectModel.xml to the cocoon-sitemap-impl module as they depend on the CocoonEntryObjectModelProvider.java that is defined there. Beans must follow the same dependency graph as the Java classes. Also changed the package of the CocoonEntryObjectModelProvider.java from o.a.c.el.impl.objectmodel that is defined in the cocoon-expression-language-impl module to o.a.c.objectmodel.impl that only is used in the cocoon-sitemap-impl module. Please avoid split packages, where some of the classes in the package are in one module and the rest in another."
