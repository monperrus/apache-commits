   "Changed from singletons backing Utility classes to pseudo-singletons (per thread context classloader). This should isolated the use of BeanUtils between web apps. Also added a test case. Note that for some 1.3 JVMs, WeakHashMap has a bug which results in a memory leak. Since commons-logging has the same vunerability and this results in the beanutils classes remaining in memory after they should have been released, I decided to go with the standard class rather than use the collections replacement which does not have this bug."
