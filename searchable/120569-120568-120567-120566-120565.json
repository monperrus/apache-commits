   "Defaulted the compile target to 1.1. If a build is done on JDK 1.4 then it defaults to JDK 1.4, which means on some JVM's (e.g. IBM's JDK 1.3) the code won't work! Even if you're not using any JDK 1.4 features. The generated bytecode can contain some JDK 1.4 specific methods!", 
   "So as a safety measure, I've defaulted the target to 1.1 by default (which is the default setting for JDK 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 anyway).", 
   "You can still overload this value on a project by project basis - this just prevents this possible bug hitting Maven users."
