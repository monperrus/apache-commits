   "1. Implemented operator substitution suggested by Jacopo and Scott. It is a subset of the beanshell operator substitution - http://www.beanshell.org/manual/syntax.html#Document_Friendly_Entities.", 
   "2. Added an extension to UEL that permits using variables that might not exist in expressions. Example: The expression ${foo + bar} will throw an exception if either foo or bar don't exist. Assuming foo and bar are both intended to be integers, the expression ${foo$integer + bar$integer} will not throw an exception. Instead, Integer instances (initialized to zero) will be created for the missing variables."
