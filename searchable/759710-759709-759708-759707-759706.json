   "Trigger an exception if the VFS transport sender is invoked in an out-in message exchange pattern. Since the transport doesn't support synchronous responses, doing so would leave an entry in Synapse's callback table that would only be released after a (long) delay. Since this entry holds a reference to the message context of the outgoing message this might quickly lead to resource exhaustion. This change forces the user to set the OUT_ONLY property as necessary."
