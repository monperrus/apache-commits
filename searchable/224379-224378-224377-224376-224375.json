   "The 'release' target in common.xml now puts together source distributions (in addition to binaries). The source distribution contains the relevant bits from the top level build and the source for the taglib of interest. It is expected that the RM will suitably modify the overall build target in his/her working copy while cutting the release. This change will not affect the nightly build setups.",
