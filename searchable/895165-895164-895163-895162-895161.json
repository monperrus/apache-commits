   "Performance improvements when running both in multi-threaded and pre-forked HTTPD. Changed memory management to use Apache APR pools instead of ref counting pointers as it's much faster and easier to integrate with the Python and Ruby interpreters. Changed to use simple pool-based string and stream implementations instead of the STL ones, which cause a lots of mutex locks in a multi-threaded environment. Added build options to compile with threading and profiling."
