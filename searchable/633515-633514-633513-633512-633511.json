   "The main advantage of this is that *normal* manifest entries come first and retain their order, with the OSGi entries being appended after. It also means that the component poms don't need to specify <packaging>bundle</packaging>. Ovrriding the \"commons.manifestfile\" property with an alternative (or blank) manifest file can be used to omit OSGi manifest entries being added."
