   "o adding a workaround for Ant 1.5 <manifest> task. IN Ant 1.4.1 manifest was only inside a jar task. In Ant 1.5 it can also be standalone. Couldn't find a better way to detect this than checking the tagname. If the check is not there, processing fails because it treats it as the manifest attribute of the jar task and complains about \"file\" attribute being required.",
