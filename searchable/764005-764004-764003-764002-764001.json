   "fix getCompactionBuckets -- something is broken in NonBlockingHashMap when removing and re-adding the same collection mid-iteration; it ends up with multiple references to that collection.  going back to ConcurrentHashMap fixes the problem.  (any additional overhead from CHM is negligible here.)  patch by jbellis; reviewed by Eric Evans for #57"
