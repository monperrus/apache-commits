   "1. Removed the ModulePolicyExtension interface from the Rampart module. Rationale:", 
   "* ModulePolicyExtension is not really implemented since Rampart#getPolicyExtension() only throws an UnsupportedOperationException.", 
   "* The UnsupportedOperationException causes a misleading error message in wsdl2java (cf. http://markmail.org/thread/3kcjha2fxo2tksey and r748704).", 
   "* ModulePolicyExtension is part of axis2-codegen and therefore requires a corresponding Maven dependency. Since it is not really used, this is an unnecessary annoyance for Maven projects depending on Rampart.", 
   "* It causes troubles at runtime. See AXIS2-3213 and AXIS2-4265.", 
   "2. Moved the codegen and xmlbeans dependencies from the root POM to rampart-integration."
