   "Spring-OSGi doesn't contain any support for beans with prototype scope. This is  mainly because there is no direct mapping between the prototype scope and any OSGi concepts. In OSGi services are either singletons at global level or at bundle level. The only reasonable mapping, AFAICS, is to export a factory bean as an OSGi service.", 
   "As Cocoon uses prototypes in many places I have extended Spring-OSGi with support for exporting a factory bean instead of the bean by setting the attribute \"factory-export\" to true. In this case a SmartFactoryBean is exported and the classes of the contained bean is put in the \"org.springframework.osgi.beanclasses\" property.", 
   "The import part is not written yet.", 
   "The code contains a lot of copy and modify from Spring-OSGi as some of the involved classes wasn't really extendible. The idea is to try to contribute it back to Spring-OSGi."
