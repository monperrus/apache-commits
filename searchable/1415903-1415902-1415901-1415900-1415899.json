   "Falcon: The MXML feature tests now run the SWF in the debug FlashPlayer and check whether the SWF terminates normally with System.exit(0) or with an abnormal exit code.", 
   "The tests for <Boolean>, <int>, <uint>, <Number>, <String>, <Class>, and generic instance tags like <Sprite> are passing in Eclipse, demonstrating correct codegen of various simple values. They are not yet part of 'ant tests'.", 
   "In Falcon, 'ant eclipse' now copies the player specified by the environment variable FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER to the compiler.tests/temp folder so that JUnit tests running in Eclipse can find it.", 
   "I updated the README to explain that you need to set FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER."
