   "Fix ADFFACES-160:  tr:table's footer facet is required for tr:column's footer facet to work.  We now use a compromise between the old rendering and the new, which tries to use as little screen real-estate as possible and won't change behavior of older pages.  If there is a table footer, but no footer in the first column, the table footer gets inserted there.  Otherwise, the table footer is put in a new row at the end.  While fixing this, noticed and filed issue 181 on some bad style names for the footer facets in the table and column"
