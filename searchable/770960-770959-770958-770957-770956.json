   "Major re-write of ReferenceManager. The refactoring included moving little-used WikiEngine.scanWikiLinks() to ReferenceManager.extractLinks(). This method should never have been in WikiEngine to begin with. ReferenceManager is also completely \"unhooked\" from FilterManager/PageEvent events, and instead listens to (new) ContentEvents that are emitted when JCR events happen. This is much, much cleaner and will allow PageRenamer to be eliminated Real Soon Now (and moved to ContentManager, where it belongs). SearchManager is similarly unhooked from FilterManager and listens for ContentEvents. Among other things, this also means that saved pages won't be indexed twice. 10 failing unit tests remain in ReferenceManager, and a few bugs still need to be pounded out. I will make one more major checkin of ReferenceManager, soon, to fix remaining tests. Overall passrate is now nearly 93%."

   "Fixed subtle bug in JCRWikiPage that was causing isAttachment() to incorrectly report its status. Also, JCRWikiPage no longer manages its own references (now handled by ReferenceManager) or saves itself to the JCR (it delegates to ContentManager, so that ContentEvent creation can be guaranteed)."
