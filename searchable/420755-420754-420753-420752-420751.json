   "1. Moved the block constants to an inner class inside the Constants class for clarity. Presence of multiple constant files is confusing!", 
   "2. Added functionality to populate a metadata map when external attributes are present. When external attributes are present they are populated as QName/value pairs into a map and stored in the metadata map under the key EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTES (constant is Constants.MetaDataConstants.EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTES)", 
   "3. Added a new test case and the relevant test case xsd file to test this functionality"
