   "* StAXOMBuilder didn't update lastNode after constructing a comment node. Under some circumstances, this caused the comment node to be discarded (as described in WSCOMMONS-115). Fixed this issue.", 
   "* StAXSOAPModelBuilder didn't handle properly the case where the SOAP envelope is preceded by a comment (or any other node). This issue was hidden by the issue in StAXOMBuilder described above. Note that having a SOAP envelope preceded by a comment is rather unusual, but is the case for some of the messages used in the test cases (where the comment is the copyright notice). Fixed the code so that this situation is handled correctly."
