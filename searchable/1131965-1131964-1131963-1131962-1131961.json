   "A couple things in this commit:", 
   "(1) Now frameworks get cleaned up in the slaves when they exit. This", 
   "included narrowing the interface with the isolation module to", 
   "keep the code simpler as well as making the work directories of", 
   "the frameworks be timestamped so as to differentiate between", 
   "multiple executors of the same framework (which may occur", 
   "because the executor was killed by us, shutdown themselves, or", 
   "died). Note that getWorkDirectory is no longer idempotent.", 
   "(2) Now slaves get an updated framework pid whenever failover", 
   "(master or framework scheduler) occurs. This included cleaning", 
   "up the semantics of connecting frameworks to their tasks either", 
   "when they re-register or when a slave re-registers."
