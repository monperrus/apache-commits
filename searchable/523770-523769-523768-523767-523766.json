   "Fixing file/dir mode parsing, to consolidate all parsing in a single utility method for easy maintenance and consistency. Also, parsing everything using Integer.parseInt( mode, 8 ) and wrapping any NumberFormatExceptions in an AssemblyFormattingException that shows the failing mode. Finally, before the utility method returns, it checks the sanity of the resulting mode for lesser segments that have more permissions, such as group-write, user-rdonly...and logs these in the WARN log-level."
