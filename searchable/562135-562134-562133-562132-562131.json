   "[JIRA CXF-862] Refactored Policy feature. Its primary task is to enable and configure CXF's policy engine. <wsp:Policy> elements now appear as child elements of the element representing this feature (<policies> in namespace http://cxf.apache.org/policy-config) rather than as child elements of the <jaxws:features> of <cxf:features> elements. Added support for child elements of type <wsp:PolicyReference>, thus allowing local as well as remote references.",
