   "Rework locking on timeout_mutex.  We now drop (and reaquire) the lock inside the while loops.  This is the least line of code changes to stop a dead lock between the queue in push2worker (a blocking function) and the timeout_mutex.  These two timeout list iterations should be rewritten with better locking rules, but for now this should fix the bug, without rewriting the entire function.",
