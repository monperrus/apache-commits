   "Although setHttpOnly is recommended for protecting the script to read the cookie values, it would bust DWR. By default, we will turn off in the GeronimoStandardContext. In Tomcat 7, it uses the value configured in web.xml and context to determine whether or not this option is turned on/off, so the users should still have chance to enable it by configuring the cookie-config in web.xml"
