   "Test fix for DIH TestScriptTransformer: Lucene-Solr-Maven-trunk build#397 produced an exception with the message \"<script> can be used only in java 6 or above Processing Document # 1\", while the test was only ignoring those exceptions with the exact message \"<script> can be used only in java 6 or above\" - switched the test for this to require the expected message as a prefix rather than exact equality."
