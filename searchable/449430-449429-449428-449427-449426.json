   "Rename \"legacy\" folder to \"integration\". Since we may also want to do this with other similar codebases, like Spring MVC, we should be more specific with the lower-level package name. For now, I'm changing the folder to \"integration\" and the package names to \"s1\" (so that we don't have struts2.struts1 in the import). We might want to roll the integrations classes into the extras module."
