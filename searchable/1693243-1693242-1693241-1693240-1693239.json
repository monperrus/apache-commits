I also tried to percent encoding but was unable to find how to replace a % in Freemarker. Thanks to Gareth's suggestion I finally escaped the quote. Also to escape the quote with replaceAll() in Java you have to put 5 \\,  small but weird issues ;) I hope nothing else somewhere already escape the quote, we will see anyway..."
