   "SDK-19772 Initially invisible graphic element can not be made visible", 
   "When visible is false, we were both setting the displayObject invisible and not drawing the graphics. When visible was then set to true, we changed the displayObject visibility, but didn't draw the graphics. The fix is to always draw the graphics when we are not sharing our displayObject. This way we simply toggle visibility on the displayObject on/off, instead of having to perform a redraw.", 
   "SDK-19581 BitmapFill incorrectly handle source property", 
   "Updated code to match code in BitmapGraphic. If the source is a class, we still need to check the type of the newly instantiated instance of that class.", 
   "SDK-19085 unexpected behaviour when setting scaleX < 3 on a LinearGradient", 
   "Internally, we no longer allow scaleX to be less than 2. Visually, this shouldn't have much impact.",
