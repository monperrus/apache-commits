   "Applied patch from jira issue - OFBIZ-3697 - setLastInventoryCount Service should not be called hourly due to performance issues.", 
   "1) In case of large database, when there are so many products into the system, then setLastInventoryCount service consider all the products and update records for them.", 
   "2) So it will keep server busy for some time in every one hour. This logic should be improved.", 
   "3) Also setLastInventoryCount service does not take facilityId into the account while setting last inventory count in ProductFacility entity.", 
   "Thanks Divesh & Pranay for the contribution."
