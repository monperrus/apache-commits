   "No functional changes, just reorganizing code: moved email services from content to the framework/common component except the CommunicationEvent related ones which are now in the party component along with other CommunicationEvent resources; changed framework components so that webapp no longer depends on common and common is higher level than the various tool components which was an odd dependency before; one new thing is in here and that is an entity called EmailTemplateSetting which is meant to be a generic version of the ProductStoreEmailSetting entity so we can have configurable email templates without depending on ProductStore, still need to write the service to send email from this (sendMailFromTemplateSetting)"
