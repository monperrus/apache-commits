   "- Moved the opensocial reference code into the new features directory.", 
   "- Added the samplecontainer.js file which can now be accessed by require feature=\"opensocial-samplecontainer\". This has a small amount of hardcoded mock data, hopefully this will change to use state files like the code.google.com site in the next change.", 
   "- Added a caja feature. Unfortunately I had to copy the caja.js file from their code.google.com site. Hopefully we will be able to pull this from maven at a later date.", 
   "The addition of these features means shindig can parse/run cajoled opensocial gadgets.", 
   "Next steps are to clean the caja related code in container.js (very hacky right now) and to add a sample container environment for testing gadgets."
