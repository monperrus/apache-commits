   "Part 2 of the AbderaConfiguration/Configuration refactoring.  This encapsulates all of the configuration details into the implementation of the Configuration interface so that it can be fully replaced.  Specifically, it removes the direct dependency that the Abdera class has on the ServiceUtil helper class so that alternative ways of instantiating the default classes can be used --- e.g. ways that don't involve crawling the classpath.  Spring users can likely benefit from this immediately by creating a SpringConfiguration implementation that uses the spring framework to specify the various implementations to use."
