   "2. added a makeURL flag that turns a file ref in a schema into a URL. v. useful for .net.", 
   "3. added a compiler enum and attr that lets you choose compiler. Compilers are microsoft|mono|microsoft-on-mono.", 
   "4. renamed parseableerrors to ideErrors.", 
   "5. dependency logic uses filesys granularity.", 
   "No tests for the compiler stuff, we need to think about how to do that."

NB, note that all four methods would all be unified if the writer/reader/instream/outstream classes had a base class \"Closeable\" with method void close().",
