   "The bug appears to be in interpreter. It is not documented, but it looks like x86_64 calling convention requires to have rsp to be always aligned on 16 bytes. When the number of stack arguments is odd, rsp is not aligned on 16 bytes. The same bug was fixed for windows x86_64 at revision 514264. Now this bug appeared on linux too because gcc generates movaps instructions for code which uses va_args. Such native function in EHWA scenario is FcPatternBuild. The movaps instruction requires alignment on 16 bytes. So I've made a patch similar to what I did for windows x86_64 for Linux too."
