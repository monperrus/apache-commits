   "Added support for Type 1 fonts which don't use the AdobeStandardEncoding for PDF and PS output. Details:", 
   "Added an Type 1 AFM parser (only basic ltr script fonts are properly supported).", 
   "Font loading changed slightly to allow loading an AFM in addition to a PFM.", 
   "Added some mapping functionality to CodePointMapping. Now we also build custom CodePointMapping instances from AFM files and use it in SingleByteFonts.", 
   "Changed more PDF object classes to make use of the generic PDFDictionary and PDFArray base classes.", 
   "Type 1 Fonts with a special encoding now register their encoding in the Encoding value of the font dictionary so the mapping is correct. For PS this isn't necessary as the interpreter just uses the font's default encoding.", 
   "Refactored CMap building code to it can also be used outside the PDF context. A CMap can now also be built from a single byte encoding.", 
   "Update of XML Graphics Commons snapshot."
