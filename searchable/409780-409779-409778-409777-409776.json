   "Changes to NetUI synchronization to facilitate synchronization on a session scoped lock.  Before, locking was performed only on the HttpSession instance; in some circumstances, this isn't a safe operation because the HttpSession implementation can vary (even within application containers).  This provides an HttpSessionListener that can be registered in web.xml in order to add a mutex object as a session attribute.", 
   "This can be retrieved by callers that need to synchronize some kind of change to the session.  To enable this feature, simply add the following to a web application:", 
   "<listener>", 
   "<listener-class>org.apache.beehive.netui.pageflow.HttpSessionMutexListener</listener-class>", 
   "</listener>", 
   "The listener is optional; if not registered, the HttpSession will be used for synchronization.", 
   "The NameService and DeferredSessionStorageHandler were changed to synchronize on this session mutex.",
