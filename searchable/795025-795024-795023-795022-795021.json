   "Initial work on the ExecutionContext and support interfaces; note that this does not compile at this point, which is part of why it is in a branch; this includes mostly interfaces for existing framework tools and a first pass at the ExecutionContext and related interfaces; for most Java code the interface changes will require something like the organize imports in Eclipse; also none of the cleanup work has been done yet on getting and keeping references to the delegator, dispatcher, etc so work needed on those too once the context access stuff is built out for this"
