   "(Patch submitted by Rupert Smith) Refactored the test ping classes to share common code. Made them runnable from the command line (the same as they already were). Also made it possible to instantiate them in other code more easily. A unit test class has been added that performs a ping. This is so that it can be run with the TKTestRunner to scale it up and take performance measurements.",
