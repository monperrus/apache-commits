   "Increase the time the threads hold onto the object. Improves the test as it should ensure that, on start, 10 threads hold objects and 20 threads block waiting for an object. Previously not all the threads would have started before the first thread returned its object to the pool.", 
   "This also allows the time between thread starts to be increased to ensure threads are started in the right order and hopefully avoid some of the continuum failures we have been seeing."
