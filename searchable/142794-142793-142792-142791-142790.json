   "Initial check-in of a Commons sandbox package that implements the GoF \"Chain of", 
   "Responsibility\" pattern, but with a couple of twists.  This package is", 
   "designed to deal with scenarios where you want to \"script\" the execution", 
   "of application business logic, but without tying yourself to APIs like", 
   "Servlet or Cocoon.", 
   "One particular use case will be a proposal to decompose the request processor", 
   "in Struts 1.1 so that it can be customized, but this is by no means the only", 
   "possibility.", 
   "A special tip of the hat to the Axis folks, where the approach to Handlers", 
   "inspired the idea that a Chain is-a Command, leading to the ability to", 
   "create arbitrarily nested trees of commands needed to process a particular", 
   "request."
