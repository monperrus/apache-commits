   "initial spike of a conversion of the XML parsing over to using some JAXB2 POJOs rather than the hand-crafted custom Spring code for CAMEL-71. This change breaks a few test cases; I've commented out a number for now - will fix them incrementally. Also it seems the new JAXB2 POJOs replicate much of the camel.builder package; so am sure we can merge the two into a single POJO model for the route definitions which can read/write themselves nicely to XML, while also being used inside spring 2 XML etc. Apologies in advance if this change breaks anything! :)"
