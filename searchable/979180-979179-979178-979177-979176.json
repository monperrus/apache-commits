   "Follow through on the suggestions given when 1.0.0 release was made. Removed LICENSE.txt as that is added to the source distro via Apache parent pom and its remote resource plugin configuration. Renamed NOTICE.txt to NOTICE so it'll replace the default one. Note that http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#notice indicates that the LICENSE file needs to be present only in the source distro (and not in svn as Sebb claimed) so we are ok. Also note that ant suggested removing the SoftHashMap and Spring related comments completely from NOTICE file but they are regarding copyrights so look fine to me, will confirm on dev list."
