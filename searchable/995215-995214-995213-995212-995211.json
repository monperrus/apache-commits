   "Updated code which checks if the OS post-load tasks have run before reserving a computer.  The code in new.pm would attempt to call post_load regardless of the provisioning module being used.  The OS module's post_load subroutine should only be called by the provisioning modules so they have the flexibility to call it or not.  Added 'POST_LOAD' return value option for provisioning modules' node_status subroutines.  Code in new.pm checks for this return string and calls post_load if necessary.", 
   "Added check in OS.pm::get_vcld_post_load_status to make sure the OS module implements a post_load subroutine.  If not, it returns true indicating post_load doesn't need to be called.", 
   "Updated OS.pm::set_vcld_post_load_status to check the OS type, and set the correct line endings in currentimage.txt based on if the OS is Windows or not.", 
   "Other", 
   "Reworked utils.pm::nmap_port to call run_command.", 
   "Fixed bug in utils.pm::run_ssh_command where it was checking if the command was a VMware command.  It was checking the output rather than the command string.", 
   "Fixed typo in utils.pm::get_management_node_info."
