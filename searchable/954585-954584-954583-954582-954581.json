   "I said \"that seems to have been introduced\" because it's working in stable demo.", 
   "I also remove a useless couple of lines at the beginning of the updatePartyContactMech service.", 
   "Finally I must say that I find very weird to have extension in PartyContactMech entity. It would be certainly more logical to have in TelecomNumber. Is it really used for anything else than phone number extension?"
