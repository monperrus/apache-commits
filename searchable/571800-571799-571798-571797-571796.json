   "To make an integration with Torque 3.3 possible, the deprecated DBSecurityService is now simply derived from TorqueSecurityService. All defaults have been changed to use the TorqueSecurityService classes. The classes in org.apache.om.security likewise are derived from their Torque counterparts. There are no references left in the code however and they can be removed in the next release.", 
   "Note that these changes require a Torque version compiled from SVN (Revision 571790 or greater) for now."
