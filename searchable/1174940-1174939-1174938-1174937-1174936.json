   "Fixed bug in Linux.pm's get_available_space and get_total_space subroutines. It now attempts to determine the block size by checking for either the 'Block size:' or 'Size:' value in the 'stat -f' output.  Some versions only display 'Size:'.", 
   "Added error checking to VMware.pm in locations where it calls get_available_space. It wasn't checking to make sure a value was returned. As a result, divide by 0 errors occurred if available space couldn't be determined."
