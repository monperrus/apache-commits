   "Added [RichTextContent] metadata to the 'content' property of RichText, RichEditableText, and TextArea.", 
   "This metadata tells the MXML compiler to disable some of its default interpreation of the value specified for the 'content' property. Normally, for properties of type Object, it assumes that things looking like numbers are numbers and things looking like arrays are arrays. But <content>1</content> should generate code to set the content to  the String \"1\", not the int 1, and <content>[1]</content> hould set it to the String \"[1]\", not the Array [ 1 ]. However, {...} continues to be interpreted as a databinding expression, and @Resource(...), @Embed(...), etc. as compiler directives.", 
   "Similar metadata on the mxmlChildren property in TLF's FlowGroupElement and SpanElement classes causes the same rules to apply within <p>, <span>, etc.",
