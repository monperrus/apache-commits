   "Completely redesigned checking of source validity. Previous approach didn't work in all cases: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.text.xml.cocoon.cvs/24099/focus=72801", 
   "In new approach, ServletSource stores Last-Modified values for its own use in store. This way we can always get all needed information to perform conditional get and return appropriate value in getValidity() method.", 
   "Maintaining own store is not the most elegant solution but it works and is quite reliable (see remark below). If someone comes with better one, I'll be happy to help implement it.", 
   "Remark: Keys for store are calculated using value returned by getURI() method which *must* be unique. However, this is not the case currently and has to be fixed ASAP."
