   "STANBOL-431: Ignore EventAdmin Timeouts (5sec) for ContentItem Enhancements", 
   "The EventAdmin implementation of Felix Blacklists EventHanders that do need to much time to process events. The default value is 5sec (see [1] for details) The processing of ContentItems by EnhancementEngines might take longer than that.", 
   "Because of that the EnhancementJobHandler got Blacklisted in such cases and was not able to receive additional Events causing the enhancement process to get stuck.", 
   "There are two possible workarounds for that:", 
   "1) set the default timeout to 0: This deactivated timeouts for all EventsHandler", 
   "2) exclude specific EventHandlers", 
   "This commits enables option (2) by providing a configuration within the full, full-war, stable and kres launcher", 
   "Log messages like", 
   "Blacklisting ServiceReference [[org.osgi.service.event.EventHandler] | Bundle(org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.eventjobmanager [64])] due to timeout", 
   "indicate that the EventAmin service is not configured correctly.",
