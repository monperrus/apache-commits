   "LUCENE-1453: Remove the complicated closeDir handling from DirectoryReader which no longer \"owns\" the FSDirectory. A FilterIndexReader, that is wrapped around the DirectoryReader by IndexReader.open(), will handle the closing of the dir. This wrapper and all File/String IndexReader.open()'s will be removed in 3.0."
