   "UserDatabaseLoginModule no longer populates WikiSession's Subject with user profile principals; this was moved to WikiSession. This should make pure, authentication-only login modules possible, such as for LDAP and Kerberos. Because authentication and user profile storage are better separated, it will prevent the need to subclass and hack XMLUserDatabase. WebContainerCallbackHandler no longer needs a UserDatabaseCallback as a result, so the callback was removed."

Consequently, GroupManager loses its GroupListener inner class, and WikiSecurityEvent gets rid of types GROUP_ADD_MEMBER, GROUP_REMOVE_MEMBER, GROUP_CLEAR_MEMBERS. If you really really need these let me know, but in the meantime the coarser-grained GROUP_ADD and GROUP_REMOVE will do what we need."
