   "OPENJPA345 The last patch had the side effect that the artifact zip doesn't contain most of the required dependency jars (e.g., commons-lang), since the transitive dependencies are not followed to pick up these jars. Resolved this by explicitly listing the required jars in the openjpa-all dependencies. Also moved most of the dependency version numbers into the parent pom.xml dependencyManagement section to ensure that all dependency versions are the same."
