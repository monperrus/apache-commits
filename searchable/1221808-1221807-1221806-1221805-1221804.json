   "o Made the entry schema aware when calling the Add operation in the CoreSession", 
   "o Added the apply(SchemaManager) to the ClonedServerEntry class", 
   "o Added AttributeTypes in the BaseInterceptor", 
   "o Added a constructor to the AddOperationContext class taht takes a schema aware entry", 
   "o Fixed some tests as the entry is now checked at a higher level (ie, not in the Normalization interceptor) for the Add operation", 
   "o Fixed an issue in the way we handled a rename operation in the DefaultOperationExecutionManager (a null was passed, leading to some missing AT in the stored entry)", 
   "o The Normalization interceptor now does nothing for the Add operation"
