   "Fixed a problem with bad try-catch-finally nesting and transaction handling in GenericDelegator.", 
   "1. The only exception caught was GenericEntityException, so any other thrown exception was missed - meaning the transaction was committed and GenericDelegator acted as if nothing was wrong.", 
   "2. The commit was performed in the finally block, so it was ALWAYS performed - even after an exception was thrown and the transaction was rolled back.", 
   "We managed to get away with this all along because typically there is a wrapping transaction that clears it all up. But still, the Delegator code needs to handle transactions correctly."
