   "Added experimental FileBasedActionResolver, which allows arbitrary ActionBean URL bindings to be specified in an external file. This will allow fully customized URL binding schemes to be defined without hard-coding them in the ActionBean classes themselves. Currently the configuration file is hard-coded as WEB-INF/urlpattern.properties. This restriction will be loosened later. FileBasedActionResolver is turned off by default."
