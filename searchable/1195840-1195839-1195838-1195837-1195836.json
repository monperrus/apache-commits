   "- It make no sense to show the version for the TLP documentation site. This is a site which can be updated when needed without releasing a new TLP pom. The showed version doesn't have isn't in any relation with the documentation, the available modules (like server, imap, ...). It's better just to show the latest update date. If a version is needed this can be overridden in the module's site.xml.",
