   "Server-side fix for issue #3657 'dav update report handler in skelta mode can", 
   "cause spurious conflicts'.", 
   "This change has two parts that are loosely related:", 
   "1) It stops mod_dav_svn from ever sending the 'fetch-props' response to a", 
   "client, even when in skelta (i.e. send-all=false) mode.  The server", 
   "already knows what properties have changed so now it simply sends them,", 
   "rather than telling the client to ask for them later.  This prevents", 
   "the svn_delta_editor_t change_[file|dir]_prop callback from receiving", 
   "faux property changes when the client asks for *all* the properties.", 
   "See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3657 for all the", 
   "gory details.", 
   "2) The comments in our code frequently make reference to 'modern' servers", 
   "and clients in the context of mod_dav_svn.  Unfortunately there is no such", 
   "thing as a pre-modern server, they are all modern!  The use of the term", 
   "'modern' in our code comments predates Subversion 1.0.0, so the comments", 
   "are misleading and the special case code for pre-modern servers (or", 
   "clients) is unnecessary.  The special-case code is interdependent with", 
   "the changes in #1 though, so these changes are being made in one commit,", 
   "despite the fact one could argue they are logically separate.", 
   "* subversion/libsvn_ra_neon/fetch.c", 
   "(report_baton_t, start_element): Remove comments about 'modern' servers and", 
   "replace as needed with discussion of whether we are in 'send-all' mode or", 
   "not.", 
   "* subversion/mod_dav_svn/reports/update.c", 
   "(struct item_baton_t): Remove changed_props, committed_rev, committed_date,", 
   "and last_author members, none of these are necessary.", 
   "(close_helper): Simplify check for when we need to send remove-prop.", 
   "Remove code which sends 'fetch-props' to the client, we've already sent", 
   "them.  Stop sending version-name, creationdate, and creator-displayname,", 
   "these were only needed by  'non-modern clients' which don't actually", 
   "exist!", 
   "(upd_change_xxx_prop): Whether we are in send-all mode or not, we have the", 
   "property changes already so send them now, rather than telling the client", 
   "to 'fetch-props' later.  The only time we don't send the props is for", 
   "additions while not in send-all mode (i.e. skelta mode) since property", 
   "fetching is implied in addition."
