   "Fixing bug in domainId criteria usage for revokePermission and revokeAllPermissions as discovered by Randy (thanks!).", 
   "After trying to fix this by correcting the relationship reference for domainId (using principal.domainId) however,", 
   "this unconvered a serious limitation of OJB in that it doesn't support (better said: completely ignores) relationship criteria arguments with deleteByQuery :(", 
   "To solve this I had to use a different implementation which first looks up the actual principal Id first (and therefore needs another SQL query).", 
   "Anyway, it now works and I adjusted the TestPermissionManager test-case to also check for this use-case."
