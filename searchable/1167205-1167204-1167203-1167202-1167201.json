   "TUSCANY-3916 - Replace WSDL representation of interface contract with an internal representation for passing via the registry. Still not particularly happy with this but I have more confidence that it will work reliably when compared to serializing/deserializing WSDL. It would be preferable I think to represent the interface contract more generally as artifacts in the domain registry but that's for another day."
