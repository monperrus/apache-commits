   "Removed WTKX compilation code.  It had some deal-breaker problems.  Most notably, the WTKX may refer to classes that have not yet been compiled, meaning that we were unable to introspect on those classes (which was required to perform WTKX compilation).  We'll re-introduce this feature as a WTKXCompiler class later."
