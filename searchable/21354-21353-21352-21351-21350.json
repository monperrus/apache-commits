   "Due to the presence of the Loggable interface in the framework api - the api is implicitly dependent on the LogKit Logger interface, which in turn means that anything dependent on framework api is also dependent on Logkit and its dependents.  This directory has been created to serve as the basis for a supplimentary api honding the depricated Loggable interface and the content of the component package.  This will allow typically packages to be built without LogKit dependnecies."
