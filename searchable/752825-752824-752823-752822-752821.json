   "Modifications to patch by jeremias:", 
   "- Fix a bug: implementation ignored anchor rectangle.", 
   "- A few simplifications concerning parameter checking.", 
   "- Added notes that the current implementation violates the DSC specification. The code produces the right pattern structures in PostScript but does not handle them according to the DSC recommendations (enclose in resource comments, extracting them from page content into the setup if they are shared among pages). This will have to be fixed at some point."
