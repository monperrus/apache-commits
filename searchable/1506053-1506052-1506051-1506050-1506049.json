   "Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55267", 
   "Separate read and write timeout for NIO and ensure that the write timeout is always the connection timeout configured in the connector. This prevents long Comet timeouts (which are intended for read operations) being used for writes which - particularly in error conditions - can cause long delays.", 
   "Since only NIO supports comet timeouts this change is only required in NIO."
