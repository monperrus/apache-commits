   "scan_directory() duplicated all the code from scan_file(), so we may as well just call scan_file()...  internally the message list is kept as a hash, with the value being the receive date.  in the case of opt_n, that used to be the message number, but is now typically -1, so we don't need to sort the message list by value, nor do we need to keep track of message count in the 1 place that tried to track it.  added in some comments, and moved some code around for easier reading/efficiency."
