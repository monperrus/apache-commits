   "UIMA-1328 Modified to copy activemq-nojournal.xml and log4j.properties to as_config which will not be in the classpath setup by setUimaClasspath script. This change fixes a runtime problem when there is a component dependent on log4j. In this case the classloader tries to find log4j.properties in a classpath and finds in the UIMA_HOME/config directory. This config file is activemq specific causing  java.io.FileNotFoundException: /activemq-data/activemq.log (No such file or directory)."
