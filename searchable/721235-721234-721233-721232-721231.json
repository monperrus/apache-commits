   "Temporary fix on included/forwarded query string parsing by delaying this to *after* the RequestDispatcher include call.", 
   "Pluto currently handles query string parsing itself while Jetspeed delegates this fully to the webcontainer itself (as its standards conformant behavior anyway).", 
   "The parameter handling in the Pluto container needs a complete overhaul to clear this up as the integration in Jetspeed now has become rather \"hacky\" and awkward this way.", 
   "NB: this \"temporary\" fix still maintains complete Portlet API 2.0 TCK compliance."
