   "I inserted an intermediate junit 3.8 style specific testcase class above DataObjectListTest (and propose to do this for others).  The intermediate class delgates much function off to a non junit 3.8 specific class.  So now any 4.1 style test classes can inherit from the non-junit superclass,  and the junit 3.8 style ones can use the junit specific ones.  This allows us to 1) promote setUp/tearDown to public to promote test harness agnosticism, 2) ensure that the testHelper has been initialized once per setUp() call, thereby permitting runs of individual tests, 3) do standard setup stuff such as create a HelperContext per test execution.", 
   "I also moved the DataObjectListTest to the Approved set (will point this out on the list to ensure no one objects)"
