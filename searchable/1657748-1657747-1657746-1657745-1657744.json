   "Updates to the xxe tool to make it compatible with version 4.x of Xmlmind XML Editor. These changes have been lingering around on my harddisk for a long time, and are by now more or less irrelevant: XXE is now at version 6.x, and from version 5.x onwards the free edition is no more. But if anyone is still using version 4, or is using any of the paid versions, this might still be valuable. No guarantee for the usability of the code with newer versions of XXE though. It worked with version 4, but it has not been tested with newer versions of XXE."
