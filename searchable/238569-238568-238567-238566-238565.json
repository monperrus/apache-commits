   "- made sure to not package the J2EE jars in the Cactus distribution (as they are not redistributables)", 
   "- separated j2ee jars from servlet jars for all projects.", 
   "- exposed a new startUpWait attribute for nested <container> in the <cactus> Ant task. This is a temporary hack while waiting for a good solution to know when a JBoss container has completely finished starting", 
   "- increased startUpWait to 2 seconds for the ejb sample project (default was 1 second) as I've had problems with 1 second.", 
   "- gave better names to deployed cactified files (instead of test.ear and test.war, which BTW was causing conflicts when using jboss as both the servlet sample and the ejb sample were using the /test servlet context and we do not have yet a specific jboss deployment per project)"
