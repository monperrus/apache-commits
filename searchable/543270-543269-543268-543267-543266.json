   "There are few character string types that should take their collation type from compilation schema. I had earlier checked in code for them", 
   "to use current schema rather than compilation schema (For reference http://www.nabble.com/more-on-system-schema-vs.-user-schema-and-character-constants.-p10885286.html)", 
   "With this commit, I am adding an utility method in ValueNode called setCollationUsingCompilationSchema(int) which will use the compilation", 
   "schema's collation type for it's DTD. And it will use the passed int value to set its DTD's collation derivation. This utility method will", 
   "be used by the subclasses of ValueNode to set their DTD's collation type to compilation schema's type wherever required. Note that NOT all the", 
   "character string types take their collation from the compilation schema. For instance, persistent character string type column from a", 
   "table will take the collation type from the schema their table belongs to rather than the compilation schema.", 
   "I have run the 2 collation related tests, CollationTest and CollationTest2 and they run with no problems."
