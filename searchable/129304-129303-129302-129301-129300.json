   "Added a way for the subclass writers to discover what the current element is. I'm not very happy with this design, I think that probably it would be better to alter the SAX inspirected API so that a context is passed through but more time is needed to consider this change and I'd like to add support for CDATA encoding today (since there are users waiting)."
