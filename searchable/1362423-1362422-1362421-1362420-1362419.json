   "Refactored the very old code in the org.ofbiz.service.job package to leverage the Executor framework of java.util.concurrent rather than relying on ad-hoc synchronization and thread management: the new code is simpler, smaller and it is now easier to review and change the execution policy; two attributes of service-config.xsd have been deprecated as they are not used in the new version (\"jobs\" and \"wait-millis\")."
