   "o Added check for projectArtifact.isResolved() before attempting to read the model from it within DefaultMavenProjectBuilder, otherwise, stub out a dummy model just like if an ArtifactResolutionException occurs.", 
   "o Disabled metadata handling for AttachedArtifact...attachments should be slaves to the main artifact, deriving version info and metadata from it.", 
   "o Cleaned up entry for it2003 in maven-core-it/README.txt...that test has been removed."
