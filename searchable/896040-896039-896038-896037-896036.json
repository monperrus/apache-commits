   "Start a endpoint registry based on Hazelcast. Hazelcast seems to do just about everything we need and seems quite easy to use compared to other options. It supports multicast and explicit ip addresses, with ip addresses you only need to specifiy the address of one node and then all other nodes get notified about the new node. Hazelcast has various encryption options to secure the domain, and it has a way to have endpoints removed when a node disapears (though that requires a bit of code on our part to get to work). One limitation is currently it doesnt support multiple nodes using multicast, but they've said they can fix that."
