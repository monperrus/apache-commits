   "Adding the getOrderItemInvoicedAmountAndQuantity service as a replacement for the getOrderItemValue service, and refactoring the getShipmentPackageValueFromOrders service to use getOrderItemInvoicedAmountAndQuantity. Essentially we're deriving the amount and quantity ever invoiced for a given order item and then prorating the invoiced amount by the proportion of issued quantity to invoiced quantity. This should result in order item values which are very close to the invoice item amounts related to the order item, aggregated across all invoices."
