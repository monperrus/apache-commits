   "Use the parent SOAPEnvelope's getOwnerDocument() before trying to use the context and before creating a brand new one. This reduces the # of instances where we have to create new documents and speeds things up.", 
   "Notes:", 
   "- I need Jarek's cooperation to figure out where he is seeing slowdown due to repeated newDocument() calls.", 
   "- With this change, Bottom line is if the SOAPPart is set for the SOAPEnvelope then we don't create newDocument's every time."
