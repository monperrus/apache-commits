   "First cut at customizable schema generation.", 
   "Introduced a writeSchema() method into the Serializer interface, which", 
   "takes an org.apache.axis.wsdl.toJava.Types object.  The serializer may", 
   "optionally use the passed Types object to write an appropriate schema", 
   "fragment into the WSDL being generated, and returns true if this was done,", 
   "false otherwise.", 
   "Currently, the two serializers that really use this are the MapSerializer (which", 
   "now produces the correct type description) and the BeanSerializer (which", 
   "calls back to Types.writeBeanClassType() to do the actual work).", 
   "This needs some more fleshing out, but the immediate problem with Maps", 
   "generating incorrect schema has been solved."
