   "Fixed minor but introduced in last commit for reclaim.pm. It was attempting to get the image name off the computer's currentimage.txt file before checking if the computer state was reloading. If the computer was already reloading, currentimage.txt can't be read and an unnecessary critical messages was sent. Rearranged code to only attempt to read currentimage.txt if the request laststate is reserved."
