   "Updates to ruby build process with the following changes:", 
   "- Removes dependency on echoe for spec generation", 
   "- Adds gemfile for bulider and uses thrift.gemspec for dependency management.", 
   "- Adds checks in configure for builder and only calls if available (make check-local on ci servers)", 
   "- Adds checks in configure for Ruby and rake (bundler as well but this is optional for check-local and auto dependency management)", 
   "- Still allows for rake to do its thing if all dependencies are in place", 
   "- Removed Manifest and setup.rb", 
   "- Adds a install task which will generate a gem and then install that gem to locally configured ruby path (no more prefix or destdir with this client)"
