   "An alternative DeliveryManager - ConcurrentDeliveryManager.java uses a modified ConcurrentLinkedQueue (Modified to maintain the current queue size) this uses a compare and swap methods to allow concurrent access to each end of the queue. Additional locking is required once the queue has been depleted to ensure that a thread is not in the process of appending to the queue."
