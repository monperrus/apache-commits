   "As announced, I brought FontTriplet to more life by making it Serializable and using it to transport the information about the font in use through the area tree. This has small effects on the test cases as the values in the generated XML are slightly different. While refactoring I saw that there's some room for optimization. Too many objects are still created. It should be quite easy now with the FontTriplet to create a small cache."
