   "- When auto-sizing RET, if the unscaled width/height differs from the last unscaled width/height, redraw the background.  The EditManager calls updateAllControllers() directly when there is interactive input such as typing or cut/paste. This bypasses our update cycle which matters if we are auto-sizing.  compositionWidth/Height are NaN and the background is drawn with the old width/height because measureTextSize hasn't had a chance to update the layout manager yet.  Once the layoutManager has been updated, the compositionWidth/Height are still NaN so TLF doesn't think there is anything to compose.  The text hasn't changed shape, but the background has.", 
   "For TLF1.1 this was not necessary for most cases but there were some cases it should have been done and this was a bug.  TLF changed TextContainerManager.updateContainer() so now it is an issue for all cases.  It used to call compose() and it no longer does.",
