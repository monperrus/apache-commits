   "Fixed bug in Rotate3D introduced when it moved out from under Rotate, which used to be its superclass. The problem was that we were not re-initializing the motionPaths array of AnimateTransform every time the Rotate3D effect was played, so we would just end up adding more and more keyframes, which ended up giving conflicting animation information to the effect.", 
   "The fix was to pull in the same createInstance() override which is already in Move, Rotate, and Scale, and do the same initialization of motionPaths[] as we do in those other subclasses of AnimateTransform.",

   "\"Final\" rename of the transform-related effects - we are replacing the previous 'Rotate3D' effect (and its superclass, Animate3D) with the class formerly known as AnimateTransformRotate3D. The new class has all of the same functionality, but it is integrated in with the rest of the transform-related effects (effects which change transform properties should collude to avoid clobbering each others results). Some of the property names have changed to be more correct or descriptive, but the functionality should be the same.",
