   "1) Some log messages being written when running the unit tests. This should be fixed when", 
   "http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10804 gets fixed.  (which by the way need discussion before people", 
   "start submiting patches for it)   The other possibility is to turn off logging when running tests, but this is not a good idea.", 
   "2) To try to make this transisiton easier, and to make the package build more easily in general, I created a ./lib directory", 
   "with (some of) the jars that httpclient is dependant on.  This will have to be a discussion topic, but it is more similar to how", 
   "the jakarta site example application is done.", 
   "3) The build.properties.sample has changed slightly so if you are using a modified copy for your building you will need to",
