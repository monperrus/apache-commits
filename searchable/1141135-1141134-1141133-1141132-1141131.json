   "Updated so each build is contained within it's own '/source', '/binary/standalone' and 'binary/war' folders.  Reason is because once you run the gpg -armor --detach-sig, MD5 and SHA algorithms on each archive, we end up with lots of files, so it is easier to navigate each build this way. Also it will now reflect how the structure should look like on www.apache.org/dist/incubator/wookie."
