   "Remove some uses of svn_iter_apr_array() and use simple C loops instead,", 
   "because that method caused too much obfuscation.  This restores the",

   "Note:  As well as introducing and using the iteration functions, r866607", 
   "made some changes to pool usage.  One such change was in the code involved", 
   "in this commit.  In the loop where svn_client_commit4() calls", 
   "post_process_commit_item(), it previously allocated the queue in a sub-pool", 
   "(for want of a scratch pool), but subsequently has been allocating it in the", 
   "function's main pool, and continues to do so after this commit.  We should", 
   "consider whether that was an accidental regression and, if so, restore the", 
   "use of a sub-pool (or scratch pool).",
