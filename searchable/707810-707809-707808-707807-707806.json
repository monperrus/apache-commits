   "Issues addressed by the change:", 
   "- old use of bool for acceptMode was inverted wrt AMQP enum values, bools are confusing.", 
   "- old AckPolicy was broken - not possible to access the instance associated with an active subscription", 
   "- old AckPolicy did not provide a way to do manual acquire, only accept.", 
   "- setting values on SubscriptionManager to apply to subsequent subscriptions is awkward & error-prone, now can use SubscriptionSettings to control on each subscribe individually.", 
   "- a subscription is a central concept in AMQP, it deserves to be a class. Subscription and SubscriptionSettings provides a single point for future expansion of interactions with a a Subscription."
