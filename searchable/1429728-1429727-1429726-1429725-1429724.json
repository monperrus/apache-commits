   "QPID-3569: Refactor TransactionTimeout", 
   "* Moved the duplicated transactionUpdateTime member from AMQChannel/ServerSession to ServerTransaction.", 
   "** LocalTransaction now maintains advances transactionUpdateTime on each enqueue/dequeue operation", 
   "** Other non-transactional ServerTransaction impls return transactionUpdateTime of 0 (as they already do for transactionStartTime).", 
   "** Changed LocalTransaction so that transaction start time is recorded on first enqueue or dequeue operation (rather than only", 
   "first enqueue)", 
   "* Moved duplicated logic from AMQChannel/ServerSession#checkTransactionStatus to TransactionTimeoutHelper", 
   "* Make TransactionTimeoutTests use a durable queue so it is actually testing with store transactions.", 
   "* Removed warnings if operational logging is turned off."
