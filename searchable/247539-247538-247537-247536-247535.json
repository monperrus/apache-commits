   "Two fixes necessary to pass TCK tests.", 
   "These fixes may also correct some problems reported in Bugzilla.", 
   "First Problem:", 
   "Echoing a hexBinary does not work.  Passing the byte[] from the client to", 
   "the server works correctly  because the stub indicates", 
   "the parameter typeQName is xsd:hexBinary;", 
   "thus the byte[] is serialized as a xsd:hexBinary", 
   "instead of the default xsd:base64.", 
   "Returning the byte[] back to the client does not work because the", 
   "wsdd operation does not know the proper returnType QName.", 
   "The byte[] is serialized back to the client as a xsd:base64.", 
   "The solution is to have the returnType attribute generated in the", 
   "deploy.wsdd and Skeleton...just like we do for parameters.", 
   "Second Problem:", 
   "The TCK wants to echo a collection of xsd:byte using a javaType of byte[].", 
   "The problem is byte[] is mapped to xsd:base64, so the serialization", 
   "and deserialization is incorrect.  The solution is to add the special", 
   "case of (xsd:byte, byte[]) to the default type mapping so that serialization", 
   "occurs correctly (serialize a series of bytes) and deserialization works", 
   "correctly (deserialize individual bytes)."
