   "testRequestScopeContents failed on WLP for 2 reasons -- one the test portlet removed request attributes at the end of the action in an inner loop that caused a concurrent modification exception.  The fix for this is being checked-in.  -- 2nd -- the java.servlet attributes were being retained internally (shared on the portal request) because that is the WLP default -- setting a portlet specific container runtime option fixes this -- though as this is WLP specific I am not checking this in -- rather it will get added when WLP picks up the TCK."
