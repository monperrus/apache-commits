   "Added commands to Version_6.pm::run_sysprep to set the interfaces to use DHCP immediately before Sysprep.exe is run since the call to enable DHCP in Windows.pm::pre_capture was removed.  Also added commands to delete the default routes so that the persistent routes are not saved in the image.  This now matches the way sysprep.exe is called for version 5.x.", 
   "Added Provisioning.pm::wait_for_power_off() subroutine. Updated run_sysprep subroutines to call wait_for_power_off after sysprep.exe is executed."
