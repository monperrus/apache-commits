   "Please check this long addition carefully. Hopefully the in-code comments should describe the reasons for this change but I'll outline them here as well. ClassLoader#getParent can return null to indicate the bootstrap classloader. Sun's implementations do not but this behaviour might be encountered in other JVMs. I haven't been able to test this patch so please check this very carefully."
