   "Disabling setUnitPriceAsLastPrice service (the service was triggered to automatically create a new SupplierProduct record when, during order entry or receive, the unit price/cost was manually set): the service is not considering currency uom id and this is dangerous because, if the facility currency is different from the currency of the order/supplier product then the order receive screen automatically converts the unit price into the currency of the facility; this was causing an update of the supplier product record with a wrong currency.", 
   "I am also not sure if it is a good idea in general to automatically update a SupplierProduct record that can be part of a signed agreement with a supplier. We may want to discuss this and take a decision (deprecate or enhance the service), but for now it is safer to disable this.", 
   "Thanks to Giorgio Tomaselli for the bug report."
