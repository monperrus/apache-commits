   "TUSCANY-1102 -- the validation introduced in EMF 2.2.2 highlit an issue with our generator,  and some invalid test cases.  This fix 1) establishes a dependency on EMF 2.2.2, 2) removes those tests which will be updated and incorporated into the fix for a new JIRA that will fix up the codegen issues 3) makes a manual fixup to the SequencesFactoryImpl which shows what the generator ought to have created and 4) Fixes up the xml test data files and leaves them where they are pending reuse in the new tests"
