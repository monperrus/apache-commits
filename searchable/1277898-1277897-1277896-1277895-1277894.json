   "Fixed FTETextField so that with htmlText, what-you-get-is-not-what-you-set, at least if there is no styleSheet. You can now set terse HTML like \"Hello <b>World</b>\" and get back verbose HTML containing the computed formats. This is the way that TextField works, although FTETextField's verbose HTML is a little more verbose in the sense of starting with <HTML>.",

   "Improved FTETextField's placement of TextLines.", 
   "When composing TextLines for the 'text' property, and when computing the TextLineMetrics returned by getLineMetrics(), we now calculate the ascent slightly differently, and round the leading.", 
   "When composing TextLines for the 'htmlText' property, we now use a new TLF LeadingModel called APPROXIMATE_TEXT_FIELD.", 
   "With the combination of these two changes, we can now get the exact same line placement for multiple lines of Arial 12 (Flex's default font) on Windows for (1) text in TextField, (2) text in FTETextField, (3) htmlText in TextField, and (4) htmlText in FTETextField.", 
   "For other fonts and sizes, there may be small differences between TextField and FTETextField, because FTE does not have access to TextField's metrics; we're using a hueristic that TextField's ascent is aproxmiately FTE's ascent plus FTE's descent. But for any font, multiple lines of single-format 'htmlText' should now be spaced the same as multiple lines of 'text'.",
