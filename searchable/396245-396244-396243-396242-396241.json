   "1. Added a test to check the minoccurs=0 case for ADB", 
   "2. Fixed the xmlbeans/CodeGenerationUtility.java to process the imported schemas properly. Thanks Dims for pointing out the proper way.(I had an alternate solution where the XMLBeans schemaCompiler was invoked directly but it is highly unrecommended and registering the custom entity resolver seemed the correct solution)", 
   "3. Added a minor fix to the ADBBeanTemplate.xsl as pointed out by Chuck. Thanks chuck for the pointer and the patch"
