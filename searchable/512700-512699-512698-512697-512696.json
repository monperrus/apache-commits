   "(Patch submitted by Rupert Smith). java_iop.diff", 
   "This adds some interop tests (which are just copies of the existing topic tests) in a new integrationtests module. The java 1.4. client build has been updated to be able to run these tests. They succesfully talk to each other and the .net code. This is intended to be a starting point of a more in depth interop test as per the spec, but does not implement what is in the draft spec yet."
