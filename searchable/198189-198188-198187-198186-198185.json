   "Removed pretend \"resolution\" of still-unresolved idrefs at ATH.endDocument().  This was apparently done to force page rendering of remaining unresolved pages at RenderPagesModel.checkPreparedPages() (which requires a page to be completely resolved before rendering).  Replacement code keeps unresolved idrefs unresolved, but explicitly forces page rendering for calls to checkPreparedPages() that originate from ATH.endDocument().  Comments welcome."
