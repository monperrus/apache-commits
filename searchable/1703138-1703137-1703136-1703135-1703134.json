   "OAK-3399 : 'one last chance before lease failure': doing 5 x 1sec retry loop when entering the leaseFailureMargin of 20sec to help situations where we eg the process was paused and we're just waking up - including the lease update thread which would do a lease update right away. For all other situations, all this 5sec retry loop does is reducing the leaseFailureMargin effectively down to 15sec - which is still fine as the clock accuracy is 4sec - so 11sec hard margin left (after 90sec of missing lease updates that is)"
