   "Thrift-1604:Python exxception handeling for changes from PEP3110", 
   "Client: py", 
   "Patch: Jake Farrell", 
   "Python PEP 3110 changed exception handling by replacing the ',' with 'as'. This was initially introduced in python 2.6 and in 3.0 the ',' usage is no longer suppported. Since exception handling through out the py lib uses the ',' it will need to be converted over to using the 'as' syntax for exceptions"
