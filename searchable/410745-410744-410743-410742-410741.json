   "Manually merge svn property changes that were done in 1.1 branch (rev 409817) to trunk by running running svnpropset.sh script at ( https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/geronimo/gbuild/trunk/svnpropset.sh ) in particular to ensure all text files have native line endings to prevent problems with patches generated against those files not being able to be applied on systems with different native line endings.  Everyone should ensure their svn clients are set up according to the documentation in http://wiki.apache.org/geronimo/GettingSourceCode so all new files are added with the correct settings."
