   "Fix for building CouchDB on Snow Leapord.", 
   "I was unable to track down the root cause of this bug, but for some reason, having -ljs in the link command for couch_erl_driver was causing a segfault when loading the latter in Erlang.", 
   "This patch just removes -ljs from the global LIBS variable and places it specificially in the libs for couchjs."
