   "Fixed some bugs where the literal 0 was being used as the value of an invalid file handle.  This affects platforms like Solaris, which use open/close, etc., instead of fopen/fclose, etc.  Removed unnecessary transcoding of file names, that resulted in round-trip transcoding.  Moved calls to initializer list to avoid initializing to a default value."
