   "Enhancement: AuthenticationManager now injects role Principals at login time from the external authorizer into our WikiSession's subject. This works with all Authorizers, including (of course) WebContainerAuthorizer. This enables grants to Principals of type com.ecyrd.jspwiki.auth.authorize.Role to be specified in the Java security policy. In particular, this means that policy files can be broadened to include container roles. WebContainerAuthorizer received a new method to accomodate this."
