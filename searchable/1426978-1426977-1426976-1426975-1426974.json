   "SHIRO-395: Consolidated Publisher and SubscriberRegistry interfaces into a single EventBus interface.  The separate interfaces were causing a lot of unnecessary complexity if you had a component that need to both publish and subscribe.  The new EventBus interface more easily/cleanly satisfies 3 usage scenarios in a single component (publish, subscribe and publish+subscribe).  All related test cases have 100% class, method and line coverage."
