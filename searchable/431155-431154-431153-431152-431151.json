   "Some additions to help with CC decline or bad info recovery options like return flags for bad expire date, nsf, and bad card number to help enable automated response to these; added testing services for these different conditions; added initial implementation of the feature to try incrementing expire date years for the current card date plus 2, 3, then 4 years if option enabled in ProductStore.autoOrderCcTryExp and if the order is an auto-order, ie OrderHeader.autoOrderShoppingListId is not empty"
