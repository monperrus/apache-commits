   "removed hacks in OpenWire to marshal the PartialCommand; we now use normal OpenWire marshalling instead. Also the LastPartialCommand now has no byte[] data in it; making the UDP marshalling code even easier. The PartialCommand literally only has a datastructure type (byte), a commandId (int) and a byte[] now. Ideally OpenWire could detect there is no need for BooleanStreams with this type.",
