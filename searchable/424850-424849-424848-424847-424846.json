   "Refactoring the document changes. The log file was way to big to build and to request on the web. I extended the projectInfo plugin in forrest with the svn functionality that we had her in lenya. Doing this I developed as well a handy way to split our big svn log apart. When I needed nearly 45 min before to build the documentation this change cuts down the build time to 3 minutes 48 seconds. :) Further this was a oft requested change from our user."
