   "HUGE refactoring of Stripes-related code that pries apart the WikiActionBean and WikiContext types. WikiContext is no longer an implementation of WikiActionBean. Instead, WikiActionBeanContext implements WikiContext by wrapping an inner WikiContext implementation (but, it still subclasses Stripes ActionBeanContext). This has all sorts of neat benefits, including near-perfect backwards compatibility with pre-3.0 JSPWiki code. The next check-in will refactor a few more things, but won't be as conceptually disruptive as this one."
