   "Two AIR bug fixes around Window.open().", 
   "1.  When open() is called on a closed window, nothing happens.  We decided this is NAB, so I\u2019m just clarifying the docs.", 
   "2.  Adding a WINDOW_CREATING event for automation.  The WINDOW_CREATE event happens too late in the game for them (this is thrown in the enterFrameHandler).  They wanted something more synchronous so they could catch what was happening based on the user-interaction more immediately.",

   "Introduce tabFocusEnabled to IFocusManagerComponent.  This replaces tabEnabled as the way to remove a component from the tabbing loop.  tabEnabled should be set to true for any component that can receive focus, and tabFocusEnabled determines whether the FocusManager will actually give it focus.  If tabEnabled=false on a non-TextField, the player will sometimes momentarily remove focus and dispatch a focusOut when the component has focus and is later clicked on.  This is now quite common with TLF-based text components so we are forced to make this change.",
