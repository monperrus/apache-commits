   "Applied patch from jira issue OFBIZ-3159 - Move geoAutoCompleter.js from ecommerce to ordermgr.", 
   "geoAutoCompleter.js currently resides in specialpurpose/ecommerce component. But now it is also used in OrderViewScreen.xml#OrderHeaderView screen. First of all we can't have dependency of ordermgr on ecommerce component. Secondly, if I am developing a custom ecommerce application with mount point /ecommerce, thus overriding specialpurpose/ecommerce webapp, and copying the geoAutoCompleter.js to my custom application (to customize) in a directory structure other than that of specialpurpose/ecommerce, then the JS file is not loaded in OrderHeaderView screen due to change of location. The only reason is the dependency stated above. Hence this change is vital.", 
   "While doing this change, all the references to geoAutoCompleter.js will need to be updated too.", 
   "Thanks Arpit for the contribution.", 
   "Special thanks to Mridul for providing notes for the implementation."
