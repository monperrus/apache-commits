   "OAK-28 Query implementation: new feature \"measure\" to get the number of scanned nodes per selector instead of the nodes themselves or the query plan; (join) conditions are pushed down to the selectors if possible, this can reduce the number of nodes read; renamed method \"apply\" to \"restrict\"; the XPath to SQL-2 converter now supports joins and only uses parentheses where needed; test queries are now much faster because /jcr:system child nodes are excluded and join conditions are pushed down; if queries take more than 3 seconds now the test is considered as failed"
