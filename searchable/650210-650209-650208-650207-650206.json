   "Added asFormatString() to Vector and Matrix interfaces and factored methods out of asWritableComparable() implementations. This is in preparation for removing the Point class (MAHOUT-47) which is redundant and only used for similar formatting by canopy and kmeans clustering. In general, other classes needing to produce formatted representations of themselves will benefit from asFormatString, which returns a more useful result than a pre-wrapped WritableComparable.", 
   "Classes Modified: AbstractMatrix, AbstractVector, DenseMatrix, DenseVector, Matrix, MatrixView, SparseColumnMatrix, SparseMatrix, SparseRowMatrix, SparseVector, Vector and VectorView.", 
   "All unit tests run. Did not add new tests since code is factored from and tested by existing tests."
