   "fix SYNAPSE-93 for http/s 202 Accepted with the non-blocking transport", 
   "The fix involves creating a dummy message context with an empty SOAP envelope and passing it back to Synapse as the response received. Synapse needs to now <send/> this message back to the client, in order to write a 202 Accepted back to its client. If the client <-> synapse transport is anything other than http/s, this dummy message would be dropped - e.g. for JMS"
