Changes to AMQMinaProtocolSession were done to ignore all input on a closing session other than the close-ok.

As said else were we need to seperate protocol exceptoions(AMQException) from internal code exception handling. Further All AMQExceptions occuring in the frameReceived method are now caught and logged. Allowing them to propogate higher will only result in thread death.",

   "MemoryMessageStore - This was causing us real problems during the failover testing. Similar checks should probably be made to any other Message Store Impl. The issue was that when shutting down the broker the MS.close() method is called this sets all the storage to null. However, there may still be message processing going on as the close() does not attempt to stop connection processing. Hence we now check to see if the Store is close throwing a MSClosedException if required. This prevents NPEs that have been seen during Unit failover testing. In fact the close() is called as a request to shutdown the ApplicationRegistry, but this only occurs from tests and broker shutdown, no attempt to unbind or prevent further connections during this period is yet done.",
