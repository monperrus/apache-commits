   "moving responsibility for creating services (and holding onto services list) out of PersistenceSessionFactory and into NakedObjectsSessionFactory; this latter NOSF now injects the services list into both PSF and also the UserProfileLoader; this means that the UPL no longer needs to bounce off the NakedObjectsContext to get hold of the services via the PSF"

   "Renamed UserProfileService -> UserProfileLoader (cf TemplateLoader & ImageLoader); renamed UserProfilePersistor -> UserProfileStore (reminiscent of *ObjectStore since has same intent); renamed UserProfileFactoryInstaller to UserProfileStoreInstaller, and now rather than returning an UserProfileLoader just returns a UserProfileStore which is always wrapped in our one-and-only implementation of UserProfileLoader; introduced FixtureType, and made FixtureInstallerDelegate only install fixtures (of given type) if the object store/profile store wants them installed; moved classes around in xmlos to all live under xmlpersistence; deleted corelib.Perspective since has effectively been replaced by applib.Perspective; moved some of the classes in applib around (out of applib.fixtures and into a new applib.profiles package)"
