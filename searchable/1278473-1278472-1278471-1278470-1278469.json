   "The ComboBox component is similar to a DropDownList but has a TextInput instead of a Label. A user can type into the TextInput and the dropDown will scroll to and highlight the closest match.", 
   "Users are allowed to type in an item not found in the dataProvider. With this behavior, a ComboBox acts as a list of suggested values, while a DropDownList acts as a list of possible values.", 
   "The full spec is located here:", 
   "http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Spark+ComboBox", 
   "This checkin includes the following:", 
   "- All public APIs implemented", 
   "- All styles implemented (except for cornerRadius)", 
   "- Basic keyboard and mouse interaction working", 
   "- Spark and Wireframe skins implemented", 
   "- Added custom selectedItem support to ListBase", 
   "What is missing:", 
   "- The keyboard and mouse interactions are partially implemented.", 
   "- The TextInput caret and selection behaviors are not implemented", 
   "- The changing event is not cancellable if setting a custom selected item", 
   "- Need to refactor DropDownList into DropDownList and DropDownListBase",
