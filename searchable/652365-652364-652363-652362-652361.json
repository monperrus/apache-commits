   "HADOOP-544. This issue introduces new classes JobID, TaskInProgressID and TaskID, which should be used instead of their string counterparts. Functions in JobClient, TaskReport, RunningJob, jobcontrol.Job and TaskCompletionEvent that use string arguments are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ones that use ID objects. Applications can use xxxID.toString() and xxxID.forName() methods to convert/restore objects to/from strings. Contributed by Enis Soztutar."
