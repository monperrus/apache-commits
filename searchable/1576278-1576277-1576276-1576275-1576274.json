   "With https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-64 the default option for text-find fields was like (aka begins with, don't ask why)",

   "Note: I'm not quite sure why like/begins-with was still used as default, since it was no longer the default in widget-form.xsd, but anyway making contains default there works. Also in ModelFormField.java to have things consistent"
