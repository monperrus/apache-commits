   "[UIMA-1107] Changed PearWrapper to pass in to the pear the UIMA Context - this lets things like sofa mappings work.  Changed the UIMA Context to allow it to have overriding ResourceManager - this allows the Pear to run with a different Classpath, Data path.  Changed the ResourceManager to add a subclass of it just to hold the ClassPath and Datapath, while sharing all the other fields with its parent.  This is needed to do even basic things like collect all the type systems in use together so the CAS creation has the right type system to create.  Added test case for passing sofa maps into a pear.  Added a test pear for this that requires a mapping."
