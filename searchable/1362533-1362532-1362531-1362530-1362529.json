   "Conform script response parsing with mod_cgid and ensure no response body",

   "are met.", 
   "The design of fcgid_bridge.c follows mod_cgid.c in its use of the", 
   "ap_scan_script_header_err_*() functions.  A patch submitted to the original", 
   "maintainer and committed in r753526 supports conditional requests simply by", 
   "not returning early when ap_meets_conditions() returns < 400.  However, the", 
   "response body is still sent, unlike mod_cgid's handling of this case.", 
   "In r541990 mod_cgid's handling of the 304 return code was altered and", 
   "key comments added.  This patch realigns mod_fcgid with mod_cgid and", 
   "adds further comments regarding mod_fcgid's output filter."
