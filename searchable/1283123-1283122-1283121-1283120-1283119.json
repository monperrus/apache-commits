   "The fix is to listen for a mouseDown event and record the target. When we get a mouseUp event, if the mouseUp target is contained in the TrackBase and is not the same target as the mouseDown target, dispatch a click event. If the targets are the same, the Player will dispatch the click event.",

The first event\u2019s target is the track and the event phase is BUBBLING_PHASE. The second event\u2019s target is the TrackBase and the event phase is AT_TARGET.",

   "Added animation behavior to scrollbars and sliders. For now, animation only happens based on mouse events (key events still have previous non-animated behavior).",
