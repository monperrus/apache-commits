   "Initial commit for the Jini TCK, taken from jinildj-1_0.zip as per Attachment on above issue.", 
   "I've added four library jar files from River 2.2.0, jsk-platform.jar, jsk-lib.jar, start.jar and sun-util.jar.", 
   "I've excluded the jar files from jinildj-1_0.zip since these contain class files not found in the source code, for now at least until I get my head around the license terms, if the class files are included in the AL2 license, then we could decompile them, reverse engineer etc.", 
   "It appears that the Jini TCK used a different variant of the com.sun.jini.start package, since not all methods appear to be present in this package.", 
   "I've added missing class and interface dependencies in new directories, the original source directory packages are all in com.sun.jini.compat.*, the new packages outside this directory represent missing dependencies.", 
   "No alterations have been made to classes inside com.sun.jini.compat.* or any sub-packages.", 
   "Not yet able to compile."
