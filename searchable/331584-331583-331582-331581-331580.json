   "Finally moved all images (besides svg2png pipes) to their new locations. Updated all contracts that used 'old' site2xhtml.xsl variables that are not aviable anymore and as well the image locations. Updated the nav-section-round-bottom.ft to produce the round bottom from css and not from the contract directly. Added stylesheet to produce roundcorner out of hex values (based on xsl submitted by Kevin. Thx Kevin it was again a big help)."
