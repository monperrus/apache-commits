   "[UIMA-1466] [UIMA-1467] Rework the PearAnalysisEngineWrapper class to forward the entire set of methods where appropriate to the contained Pear AE.  This should hook up things like JMX beans, reporting, etc., and corrects issues reported in these two Jiras.  Unfortunately, test cases were not expanded to validate the new areas (any volunteers?) but the old tests run of course."
