   "Fix for IBATISNET-100 that postpones associating cacheModels to statements until all sqlMap resources have been processed. This alleviates some of the issues with having to load sqlMap resources in a certain order if the cacheModel references statements from a different namespace. A log message is generated each time a cacheModel is associated with a statement. Also changed the SqlMap.xsd file to longer require a statements node. This allows cacheModels nodes, resultMaps nodes, etc. to be in their own file."
