   "SDK-22250.  Rework ENTER key management so that TLF processes the key except in the case of multiline.  We no longer set the textFlow configuration manageEnterKey property to false since once it is set in the textFlow it can't be changed.  This was particularly problematic when the textFlow setter was used when multiline was false but it was also problematic if multiline was changed after the textFlow was created.", 
   "SDK-22207 and SDK-22210. Work around a scroller measurement issue in ScrollerLayout.measure().  It has heuristics for figuring out whether to use the actual content size or the preferred size when there are automatic scroll bars.  Force it to use the preferredSizes until the content sizes have been updated to accurate values.  This comes into play when remeasuring to reduce either the width/height.",
