   "[master] Better log message on receiving ZK unassigned events", 
   "Author: mbautin", 
   "Summary: We are trying to diagnose a bug when a NodeCreated event caused by the OFFLINE node being created in the unassigned region ZK directory triggers a region state transition event, and then a NodeDataChanged event triggers a duplicate instance of the same event. This requires better logging of the ZK event that triggered a region state transition event.",
