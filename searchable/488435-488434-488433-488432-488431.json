   "Applied the patch from Drew (Thanks!) for Jira-1018, add a setConnection API to the JDBC Control.  The new api works as follows:", 
   "- If the JDBC control has already acquired a connection, setConnection will cause that connection to be closed.", 
   "- A connection set via setControl() will NOT be closed by the JDBC control", 
   "- If the JDBC control already has a connection supplied via the setConnection() api and setConnection() is invoked again,", 
   "the connection will be replaced", 
   "- If setConnection() is invoked with a null parameter value, the JDBC control will return to its default behavior for acquiring and releasing connections.", 
   "- It is no longer an error to define a JDBC control without a ConnectionDriver or ConnectionDataSource annotation.  The setConnection() api must be used to establish a connection before invoking any JDBC control methods which require a connection.",
