   "- The LevelDB based store now exclusively looks up message payloads using locators.", 
   "- Eliminated the msg_key -> log  index entry per enqueued message.", 
   "- The LevelDB store is now avoiding many of the implicit conversions that the PBSupport class was performing.", 
   "- Updated the base Store Test case so that it use locators as it's now required for LevelDB."
