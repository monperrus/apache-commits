   "[master] Misleading exceptions for table creation", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary:", 
   "There is an issue in puma cluster that user cannot create table since there is NPE in the block placement policy. However, the user keep getting the misleading exceptions, table existing exceptions.", 
   "The reason is because there is a retry loop for table creation and once the master retries the table creation operation, it will naturally throw a table existing exception.", 
   "In current code base, even though there is a retry logic, master usually can create the table in one pass. Otherwise, the user will get the table existing exception. Also it didn't make sense to retry the table creation operation without any cleanup. I feel we can just simply remove the retry logic here.",
