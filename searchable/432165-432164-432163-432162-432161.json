   "DERBY-1652 - Update trigger updating the same rows as the original update does not throw an exception ERROR 54038: \"Maximum depth of nested triggers was exceeded\" as it should", 
   "Contributed by Yip Ng", 
   "The cause of the problem is that the trigger descriptor is created after the stored prepared statement(SPS) has been compiled, so the compiled form of the SPS is not aware of that its trigger action can fire on the trigger table itself. Hence, the constant action was not generated correctly.", 
   "During upgrade, the SPSs are invalidated at database boot time. The SPS will be recompile when it is being invoked and the recompilation at this point will of course detect the relevent trigger and generate the correct constant action for the SPS and produce the expected behavior when the SPS is executed - throwing an error when it exceeds the trigger's maximum depth in the above case.", 
   "The simplest solution without introducing another revalidation of the SPS is to create the trigger descriptor first before compiling the SPS. I ran derbyall and had to go over the testcases which have the wrong master outputs and I have corrected them on this patch."
