   "_after_ all things were changed and anything compiled fine again.", 
   "So no dangling references to the old headers in the HEAD sources", 
   "should exist. I also verified this via grep.", 
   "o  The backward-compatibility headers display a warning under GCC indicating", 
   "that they are obsolete together with a hint which file should be used",

   "o  The dependencies in the Makefiles and the \"distclean\" target in",

   "o  Some C comments were also changed to now read \"ap_config.h\" instead",
