   "VCL-291", 
   "Removed section which calls the OS module's post_load() sub from new.pm. This is now handled by the provisioning modules.", 
   "Removed code which checks from SSH from vmware.pm, esx.pm, xCAT.pm, and xCAT21.pm. Added calls to post_load() to these modules.", 
   "Created Module.pm::code_loop_timeout(). It gets passed a code reference and timeout arguments. It attempts to run the code until it returns true or the timeout is reached.", 
   "Moved wait_for_ping(), wait_for_no_ping(), is_ssh_responding(), and wait_for_ssh() from Windows.pm to OS.pm so they can be used by other OSs. These were updated to use the new code_loop_timeout() sub. They were also changed so the arguments are in seconds rather than minutes for better control. Updated all calls to these subs in the Windows modules to use seconds.", 
   "Created OS.pm::wait_for_response(). It accepts timeout parameters and waits for the OS to respond to SSH. Added calls to wait_for_response() in Windows.pm::post_load() and Linux.pm::post_load(). Also created separate Version_6.pm::wait_for_response() sub which uses longer timeout values because Vista and 2008's Sysprep takes much longer.", 
   "VCL-185", 
   "Removed \"$image_os_type =~ /linux/i\" section from load() sub in xCAT.pm and xCAT21.pm which wasn't being called anymore since vmware.pm::post_load() has been implemented.", 
   "VCL-42", 
   "Moved set_device_path_key() and get_driver_inf_paths() subs from Version_5.pm to Windows.pm so they can be used by newer Windows OSs. Added call to set_device_path_key() in Version_6.pm::run_Sysprep().", 
   "VCL-297", 
   "Updated DataStructure.pm::get_computer_private_ip_address() to correctly get the private IP address out of /etc/hosts instead of using the database value.", 
   "VCL-298", 
   "Removed vmware.pm::vmrun_cmd() subroutine. It wasn't being called from anywhere and actually was calling 'vmware-cmd stop hard'.", 
   "Other", 
   "Updated utils.pm::_pingnode() to check for the hostname argument.", 
   "Updated utils.pm::run_ssh_command() to catch if vmware-cmd was run with a syntax error. It returns exit status 255 when this happens. run_ssh_command() was assuming this meant an SSH error occurred and retried the command 3 times needlessly.", 
   "Added optional argument to DataStructure.pm::automethod. If get_... is called with a true argument, warning output is suppressed if the value has not been initialized. This allows get_... to be called when the caller knows the data may not be defined without always generating a warning.", 
   "Added DataStructure.pm::get_reservation_info_string() subroutine. It assembles a string with reservation  data to be used in notify messages. Similar code used to be contained within xCAT.pm when a load failed. It was moved out so it can be used in other situations and so a consistent message is displayed."
