   "The old Features class has been renamed SpecificationFacets, and just does simple lookups of facets for some of the more common ones.  Stuff that was in Features that wasn't captured as a facet (for example isAbstract, isService and isExtendable) has been moved as regular methods on NakedObjectSpecification directly.  The getFeatures() method on NakedObjectSpecification has been removed since it is now no longer required."
