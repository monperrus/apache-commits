   "I hadnt planned to commit this yet, but since I accidentally just included the constants patch, I might as well go with the use of one of the constants I just added. This patch (a) sets the timeout from the consts file and (b) extends the default timeout to ten minutes. Also to come, once I have written a test, is the  ability to set the timeout on a call from a property, thus letting people coding against JAX_RPC to do it."
