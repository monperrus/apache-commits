   "TUSCANY-3149 - Generally be more careful about removing object references in host-webapp. Specifically there is a problem with the axis ws binding (JIRA 3732 in the Axis project) where a shutdown hook is registered but not removed. This is fixed in Axis2 1.5 but as we are still in 1.4.1 I've worked round it here."
