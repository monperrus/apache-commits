   "HAEMONY-3941: [drlvm][gc_gen] EUT suite 'ui' crashes during stress test execution when gc_gen is used with Out of Memory. This patch gives a fix in two folds: to reserve more space in MOS when LOS extension; to slide-compact LOS during los_alloc failure. This patch also enhances the GC verifier to catch the corner case bug."
