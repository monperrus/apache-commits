   "updating XMLReaderFactory to SAX 2.0 R2 Pr3 level.  This makes loading class parsers more robust, in way similar to the previous update of ParserFactory.  Note that this commit also addresses the two alternative methods for locating a default XMLReader that the new XMLReaderFactory provides--that is, an entry in META-INF/services is included, and the XMLReaderFactory defaults to our implementation if no other is found."
