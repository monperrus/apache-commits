   "Updated cygwin-sshd-config.sh. Moved mount point section to beginning of script and set explicit paths to mount.exe and umount.exe. The script was failing to find mount after /usr/bin was unmounted.  This should allow the script to work if mount points are not configured prior to its execution. Also moved section that sets root as the owner of /home/root to earlier in the script."
