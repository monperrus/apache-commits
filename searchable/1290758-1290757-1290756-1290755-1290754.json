   "More work to support FXG 2.0 in the MXML Graphics library.", 
   "1. Switch blendMode default from layer to normal. Before, we did some trickery under the covers, where even though the default blendMode was layer, we actually only set it to layer when it resulted in a rendering difference (ie: when alpha was > 0 < 1 and other overlapping cases). Now, FXG 2.0 mandates blendMode default is normal \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to do that trickery because the FXG exporters are smarter and will set blendMode explicitly to layer when necessary. This change is for Group and all graphic primitives.", 
   "2. I\u2019ve added new enumerations to blendMode and maskType as well as a couple of new properties as mandated by FXG 2.0. There is additional work that needs to happen there that I\u2019ll be doing next week.", 
   "3. I\u2019ve renamed Group\u2019s resizeMode enumerations from \u2018normal\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019 to \u2018noScale\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019.", 
   "4. I\u2019ve renamed BitmapImage\u2019s resizeMode enumerations from \u2018normal\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019, \u2018repeat\u2019 to \u2018noScale\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019, \u2018repeat\u2019. The default value for BitmapImage.resizeMode went from \u2018repeat\u2019 to \u2018scale\u2019. Additionally, BitmapImage.repeat property has now been eliminated - use resizeMode=\"repeat\".", 
   "5. I\u2019ve deprecated BitmapFill\u2019s \u2018repeat\u2019 property. I\u2019ve added a \u2018resizeMode\u2019 property to BitmapFill with the same enumerations, defaults and behavior as BitmapImage. I\u2019ve also moved BitmapImageResizeMode from spark.primitives to mx.graphics. I\u2019ve also renamed BitmapImageResizeMode.as to BitmapResizeMode.as (a PARB-approved rename).",

   "With this check-in, we now collapse Path segment classes (PathSegment, MoveSegment, LineSegment, CloseSegment, CubicBezierSegment, QuadraticBezierSegment) as internal, private classes in Path. Paths will now be wholly dependent on the compact syntax for expressing Path data. Previously, users could write:", 
   "<Path>",

   "<LineSegment x=\"100\" y=\"100\" />",

   "<Path data=\"M 0 0 L 100 100 Z\" />", 
   "Additional changes include:", 
   "1. Path.segments property removed. In its place, there is private variable (segments) which holds the path data parsed into the correct segment objects.", 
   "2. Path.segmentChanged() removed \u2013 Segments do not need to notify the parent path when their properties have changed since they are now not individually accessible.", 
   "3. PathSegment.segmentHost property removed \u2013 Segments do not need a pointer back to the parent Path since now they are now not individually accessible.", 
   "4. PathSegment.notifySegmentChanged() removed \u2013 Segments do not need to notify the parent Path they have changed since they are now not individually accessible.", 
   "5. PathSegment.dispatchSegmentChanged() removed \u2013 Path segments do not need to dispatch propertyChange events since they are now not individually accessible. As part of this, I have removed the [Bindable] and \t[Inspectable] metadata from all PathSegment properties.", 
   "6. PathSegment no longer extends EventDispatcher, instead it extends Object.", 
   "7. All of the PathSegment and derivative classes no longer have getters/setters for their properties (like x, y, etc) since these properties are now not dispatching property change events.", 
   "8. A variety of checkintests/sparkTest project files have been updated to use the compact syntax as they are drawn/transitioned between state changes. Refer to sparkTest/AddItemsTest.mxml and RemoveItemsTest.mxml for examples on how to use states and transitions to transform Paths through the data they are bound to (as opposed to modifying individual segments).",
