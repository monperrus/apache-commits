   "Fixed some potential NPEs caused by synchronization problems.  They were noticed while looking at the code and not from an actual error.  This problem has been in the code since the earliest versions.", 
   "It was possible (but unlikely) that an error could be thrown if instruments were being looked up while other threads were registering new ones at the same location in the tree.  There was no danger if the contents of the instrument tree was not being modified, or if the modifications were not taking place while the tree was being browsed."
