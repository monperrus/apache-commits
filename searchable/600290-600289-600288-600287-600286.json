   "- reproduce split cache bug in unit test and fix it (IVY-628)", 
   "The problem with that bug was due to bad cache manager use in XmlReportOutputter.", 
   "The problem was due to the use of a File destDir and a CacheManager which is not the one used by the ResolveEngine.", 
   "Hence I've modified ReportOutputter to use a cache manager instead of a File dest Dir.", 
   "Note that this will break any custom ResolveOutputter since the interface has changed, but we aren't in API stable mode for Ivy 2.0, and updating a previous outputter will be pretty easy (you have the \"dest dir\" available in the cache manager replacing the dest dir as parameter)."
