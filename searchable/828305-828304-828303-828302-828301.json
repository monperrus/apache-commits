   "To make room for a file update field (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ROL-1838) in the Edit Media File page, I'm moving the \"create weblog post\" and \"create weblog podcast post\" action from the Media File Edit page to the Media File View page. In the Media File View page each Media File now has an add button, a YUI menu button that offers two options: create weblog post and create weblog podcast post."
