   "Finished off first take at listservs.  GenericListserv is generic implementation of a listserv, and there are Avalon and Town imlementations that define who is on the listserv and any settings.  GenericListservManager is a generic implementation of a way to add or remove yourself from the listserv via email.  There is an Avalon implementation of this.  CommandForListserv is a simple matcher that makes it easy to spot these commands for the Avalon implementation of this.",
