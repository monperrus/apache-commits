   "Added support for localization of strings specified via BeanInfo (org.apache.beehive.controls.api.packaging.*) annotations.  A string annotation value can have the form \"%<resource-specifier>%\" and the value will be pulled from a resource bundle.  The <resource-specifier> string is a base resource bundle name (which will be customized based upon the default locale) concatenated with a resource name inside the bundle, seperated by '.'.   Generated BeanInfo classes will dynamically pull the string value from the resource bundle, enabling BeanInfo attributes (name, displayName, shortDescription, etc) to be customized for different locales.  The beaninfo test in the Controls checkin test set includes a sample usage."
