   "- remove a number of downloads from central that were slowing the build significantly", 
   "- ensure the tests will run with a repo manager and no central access", 
   "- ensure the tests will run offline if the local repository is populated", 
   "The technique for populating the repository is very hacky. We really need the tests to be doing this themselves. Perhaps moving these IT-like tests into the IT section and alongside the core ITs is the way to go - but this is a start."
