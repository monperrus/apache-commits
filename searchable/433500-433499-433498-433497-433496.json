   "Moved classes that were in the parent up to this directory leaving only Wsdl2Java and its Constants interface in .generator.", 
   "Also added the WsdlMerge utility and supporting classes here (DefinitionInfo, DefinitionConstants). This utility is for taking several existing WSDL files and mreging them together and combining all of their portTypes, resource property documents and schemas. See the documentation (which will be updated shortly).", 
   "Also added the Configurable interface which the three components (projectizer, synthesizer and analyzer subclass). This is also going to be updated in the docs. All of the classes now have a consisten interface and take a ConfigurationData object (basically a wrapped Map).",
