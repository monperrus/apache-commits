   "1) Changed the name of the ServiceControlGenerator ant task to WebServiceControlGenerator", 
   "2) Updated build files which used the task, also updated task name in build files, instead of 'scgen' changed to 'webservice-control-generator'", 
   "3) Changed the name of the 'wsdlPathAnnotation' property to 'wsdlRuntimePath' in the task, just to be a bit clearer about what that attribute does.", 
   "4) Added three new attributes to the task: 'serviceName' and 'serviceNamespace' to provide the ability to select a specific service from a WSDL which contains multiple services.  'servicePortName' to provide the ability to select a specific port of a service.  These are all optional attributes and the default behavior has not changed (the first service / port found will be the one used to generate the control)."
