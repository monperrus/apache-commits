   "Fix for floating point errors showing up in NumericStepper. The errors stemmed from adding/subtracting the offset (the minimum value) from the value that's being validated. We avoided float errors in the rounding by scaling, but didn't account for errors when adjusting by the offset. Now, we scale the offset as well to remove these errors.  Shouldn't round the offset value if the interval is an integer. Only round when we are  scaling the values to remove the unneeded precision. [SDK-31416][SDK-31417]"
