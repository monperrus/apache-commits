The biggest of these is that UIComponent SHOW and HIDE don't dispatch all the time anymore--they only dispatch if someone has attached an event listener directly to them (capture phase won't work).",

   "Making a performance change in MobileIconItemRenderer/MobileItemRenderer in how we measure text.  We don't call UIComponent.measureText() anymore as that creates another TextField behind the scenes and changes its text.  Instead we now just ask for the textWidth/textHeight of the TextField we are already using.  This change should give us about a 10-15% improvement.  I added a FIXME to change it in ButtonSkin and look for other places we need to change it as well.",
