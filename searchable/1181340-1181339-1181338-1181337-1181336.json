   "HBASE-2862: Name DFSClient for Improved Debugging", 
   "Reported by Hairong. We had an HDFS error on our test cluster. It was hard to debug the HDFS NameNode logs because there was no way to map DFClient => RegionServer. Hadoop guys added a hacky config value, mapred.task.id, which allows you to add a suffix to the DFSClient ID for logging. We piggyback upon that for our HLog/HFile code"
