   "fixed a bug where render check was visiting children of invisible containers. this can lead to problems when we have a hierarchy like this: repeater->repeater_item->comp,  repeater is invisible and comp has isVisible() overwritten and inside uses its model. Since the repeater is invisible its items will not be rebuilt and so comp's model can be stale and when its isVisible() is called by the render check you may get an error from model.getObject()."
