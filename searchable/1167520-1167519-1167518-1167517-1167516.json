   "A patch from Paul Foxworthy \"createItemIssuanceRole and deleteItemIssuanceRole require Shipment PK parameter\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4344", 
   "createItemIssuanceRole and deleteItemIssuanceRole both call checkCanChangeShipmentStatusPacked, which checks the current status of a shipment to see if anything about it can be modified.", 
   "Therefore, these services require a shipmentId parameter, but at present their service definitions don't say so.", 
   "At high logging levels, this bug causes log entries to say there's a missing PK value on a FindOne.", 
   "This is not a major problem at present. create... is only called in the midst of another service and the test has already been done, but a direct call to create... might cause incorrect behaviour. delete... is not called within Ofbiz at present."
