   "Derby-314: improve Eclipse plugin network server process handling.", 
   "The fix changes the behaviour to the following:", 
   "1) Only one network server can be started per project.", 
   "2) Once a network server is started for a project it must be stopped before any", 
   "of it's settings (port, host and derby.system.home) can be changed.", 
   "3) If a user tries to change these settings when the network server is running", 
   "they will be notified that they cannot change them, and the text fields", 
   "become uneditable.",
