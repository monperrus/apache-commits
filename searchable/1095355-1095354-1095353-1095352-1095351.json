   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3288 - JDBC persistence adapter, intermittent performance degradation when a durable subscriber of priority messages falls behind. Store recovery was sometimes ignoring batch limit and would recover till memory limit was reached. Resolved issue with out or order delvery and immediatePriorityDelivery policy around memory limit boundaries. Resolved issue with over eager cleanup when priority and non priority destinations are mixed. Removed potential full table scan from cleanup. Resolved issue with null message ref (prefetch=0) and expiry. Added a bunch of corresponding tests"
