   "Fix t/modperl/interpreter.t", 
   "ModPerl::Interpreter was added to the threading branch by r584377 and r594347 but when I merged those with the httpd24 branch into the httpd24threading branch the merge only went into xs/tables/current; I missed adding them to the new xs/tables/current24 too.", 
   "Note: This is a manual update of the xs/tables, just like the original commits on the threading branch appear to have been too judging by the fact that the timestamps at the tops of those files were not updated. I have not run \"perl build/source_scan.pl\" since it doesn't seem to run properly here on Windows, even after setting $Config{cppstdin}."
