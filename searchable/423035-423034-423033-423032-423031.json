   "DERBY-802 OufOfMemoryError when using BLOB from scrollable insensitive result sets. The fix is to avoid the use of cloning the rows before inserting them into the BackingStoreHashTable. The BackingStoreHashTable has been fixed so that it does not do unnecessary cloning. The estimateMemoryUsage methods of SQLBinary and its subclasses has been improved to return a better estimate, so that rows with BLOBs will be backed to disk when using BackingStoreHashTable. Tests have been committed separately."
