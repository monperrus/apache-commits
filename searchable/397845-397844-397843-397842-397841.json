   "If there aren't any information available to find out the fault reason, we set the message of the expcetion as the faultreason/Reason. But when a fault is thrown from a service or some where, it will be wrapped by different levels. Due to this the initial exception message can be lost. This commit will fix that with a flag and if it is set then, Axis2 tries to get the first exception and set its message as the faultreason/Reason."
