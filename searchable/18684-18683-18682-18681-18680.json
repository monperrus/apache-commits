This commit brings 3.4 to a buildable and runnable state although there is still of lot of updates to make to the kernel implementation including completion of a seperated kernel jmx adapter, exposure of a shutdown timeout parameter in the composition api, caching of timeout references, assembly and disassembly events, linking these events to runtime deployment and decommissioning cycles, probably extraction of the logging api and impl to a peer package, and incorporation of code level security policy handling."
