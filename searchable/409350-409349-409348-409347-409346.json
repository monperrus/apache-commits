   "Changed Monitor and MockServer to be ANT tasks. Because.. On win XP (sp2 only) the system was running out of sockets. The best way around this was for the MockServer and Monitor to limit the number of times they created server sockets per test run. So, now the MockServer and Monitor are only created once per test-run. On a per-test basis they are flushed and re-freshed. At the end of the test-run they are terminated."
