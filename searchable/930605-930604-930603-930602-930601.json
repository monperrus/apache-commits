   "THRIFT-746. java: Generated services Iface/Client inner classes do not derive from base classes", 
   "This patch causes all generated Client classes to inherit from TServiceClient, an interface that provides a way to get the protocols the Client is using. Also, it causes a new TServiceClientFactory implementation to generated for each Service, which provides a generic, reflection-free way to get Clients. These changes make it easier to build generic pools of Client objects.",
