   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",

   "Adding new SetAction effect, plus minor improvements to effects overall. This new effect combines the old SetPropertyAction and SetStyleAction effects, figuring out for the named property whether it is a property or a style of the target object. Also, added new capabilities to Animation class and fixed some problems with easing default values.",
