   "1.  Fixed remote clustering (or server chaining) and failover.", 
   "I've tested with up to 3 remote servers.", 
   "You can chain remote servers.  Basically, gets can be distributed.", 
   "Since gets are the most common operation, this will help a system scale.", 
   "Also you can set servers to failover.  This allows you to have a hot standby.", 
   "2.  Cleaned up javadocs all over the place.  There is still more to do."
