   "a) for the runtime, the fact that ClassImpl now maintains lists of user visible properties,  rather than relying on the state of the EMF implementation objects", 
   "b) for the generated classes, the creation of 2 sets of Property indices,  one for the user and one for referencing internal EMF objects' features.  Each generated class has a generated method for mapping between the external and internal indices.",
