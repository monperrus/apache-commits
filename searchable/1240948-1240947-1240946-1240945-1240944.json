   "### STANBOL-483", 
   "* Moved Clerezza LDPath repository to an own module", 
   "* Added Unit Tests", 
   "* removed some unnecessary type conversions for TypedLiterals", 
   "* Added support for BigDecimal", 
   "* changed contenthub/ldpath to use this new module", 
   "* added this module to the commons bundle list", 
   "Also the LDPath dependencies are now part of the commons bundle list. This avoids in that Entityhub and Contenthub need to include them twice.", 
   "### CLEREZZA-683", 
   "* Changed the used in-memory MGraph implementation from SimpleMGraph to IndexedMGraph for most of the components", 
   "* Added \"org.apache.stanbol.commons.indexedgraph\" to the commons bundle list. This ensures that IndexedGraph is available to all stanbol launchers.", 
   "### Other Changes", 
   "* Corrected a Bug in the UnitTest of the EntityMentionEngine. Now all created TextAnnotations use different URIs and do no longer override each other"
