   "Updated all of the opensocial js interfaces to use the 0.8 apis. Filled in the compatibility layer so that old opensocial 0.7 gadgets still work. (The checked in gadgets are both still working under 0.7 as well)", 
   "There are some small todos that need java/php code changes. Namely the servers don't support the removeAppData call nor filterOptions yet.", 
   "Note: These changes don't actually add any real functionality. None of the new features are really utilized. We should add support for this in the future but all of the restful/json social data stuff is under a lot of change right now."
