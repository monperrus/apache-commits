   "SLING-5030 part 2: when an instance detects that it is ISOLATED_FROM_TOPOLOGY it resets the leaderElectionId - that has the effect that it will be the least likely to become leader - which means that it is put at the end of the instance ordering. This will ensure that the newly elected leader can stay leader - thus reducing the number of leader changes in case of a temporary and then healed network-partitioning situation. Note that this also implies that when an instance does NOT detect the ISOLATED_FROM_TOPOLOGY that it will NOT step down in the leader ordering."
