   "continuum-992 John Didion submitted a patch to continuum-core that adds the ability for the projects during the mapping process to make sure of the settings.xml file server declaration for retrieving the scm username and password, which I think is a pretty good way to go about this.  this was handy since I was about to dig in and look at doing this same thing but putting the username and password that are passed in that scm down into this method and using, which might still happen but this addresses the immediate issue of scm user/password being available there.  I'll look at maybe applying this up at that top screen as well as an allowable method of attaching scm info to the pom that might be added to the Add m2 project link."
