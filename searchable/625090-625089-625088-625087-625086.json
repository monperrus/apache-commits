   "Enhancement: build.properties and jspwiki.properties now support configuration of a log4j-based security log. The default name is security.log. Use it to view error conditions or more detailed trace information about login/logout events, authorization decisions and more. To provide this capability, WikiSecurityEvent constructors were modified to add log entries to the Log4J Logger \"SecurityLog\"."
