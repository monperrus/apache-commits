   "1. XSLP had been used for Ant style task - once Ant has been upgraded the task requires only Xalan to be available", 
   "2. Xalan location duplicated - pointed out by two key names in build.properties", 
   "3. Changes to jar file names in build.properties", 
   "4. Fix - invoking test targets after clean works", 
   "5. docs target changed as classpath element doesn't influence how it really works. Moreover, style task won't work under JDK 1.3.x without invoking it via $OPENEJB_HOME/bin/build.bat or after xalan-2.4.D1.jar is in $ANT_HOME/lib as described in Ant documentation. It works, however, under JDK 1.4.x where JAXP is included."
