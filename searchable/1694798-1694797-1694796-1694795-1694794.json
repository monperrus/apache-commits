   "- Use RTimer where currentTimeMillis is used for timing", 
   "- Abstract out a new class TimeOut for when currentTimeMillis/nanoTime", 
   "is used to timeout operations.", 
   "- Used `new Date()` in some cases where that is the logical intent.", 
   "- Deprecated a couple of APIs which were publicly exposing epoch time,", 
   "in favour of Date objects to make the intent clearer.", 
   "- A couple of cases had currentTimeMillis in dead code.", 
   "- In some cases where currentTimeMillis was used to just generate a name,", 
   "used nanoTime instead (really it should be some sequence/random number", 
   "in such a case).",

   "this is then used in replication -- this is concerning since absolute", 
   "times are being compared, but that can be dealt with separately."
