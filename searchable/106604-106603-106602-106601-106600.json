   "What's the probability that I run into an already used port with the new probably_unused_spamd_port() code?  Less than 1 per mill?  Ask Murphy...", 
   "The routine now tries to ask netstat if that port is already in use.  I tested the pattern on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.  If netstat can't be run, no harm is done, the routine will just work as before.  The grep is pretty broad, it might also catch a remote port; then it just tries the next random one.  (Hey Murphy, it really can't hit a used port ten times, can it?)"
