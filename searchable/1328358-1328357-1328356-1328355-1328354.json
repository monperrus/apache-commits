   "The cache of parsed Groovy scripts was not thread safe; this issue, in instances with several concurrent threads running the same script the first time (i.e. not cached) could cause the same script parsed multiple times and then added to the cache (overriding the previous value); this event was causing the clearing of caches in Freemarker; because of a bug in Freemarker [*] this could cause a deadlock.",
