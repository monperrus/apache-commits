   "[UIMA-832] update to 2.2.2.  Added an ant script in uimaj-distr ... / build/changeVersion.xml and a versions.properties file, to do most of the work of changing the versions.  Some things not automated, but for those, the script echos a message to remind what need changing manually.  Some of the POMs have an xml comment added to the line the script is to change, to improve the chances of the script avoiding to change the wrong thing.  The script always checks for the \"previous\" value, and only updates if it finds that.   So it can be run repeatedly without harm."
