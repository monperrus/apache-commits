   "This commit hooks in the Pluto PortletRegistryService with both the PortletFactory and Jetspeed PortletRegistry. The PortletRegistryService interfaces need some work, we can sort that out later. The one required API from PortletRegistryService is getPortletContext, as its called by the container to get the invokers going. I had some problems getting a servlet config to the portlet factory, but may have found a way by wiring in, via Spring, the ServletContext to the PortletFactory, then getting a context for the portlet apps via the servlet api. Its untested but Im sure it will popup during tests. I hate to check in the PortletFactory in such a bad state, but I wanted to get the class loader map refactoring in there before quitting for the night."
