   "1. Modified the Schema.java.SchemaImpl.java and WSDLPump.java to have a name inside the Schema.",

   "3. Moved the generated service.xml's to a service_descriptors/<portype_name> folder to avoid conflicts. Earlier the generated service.xml's were overriding each other when multiple port types were present.", 
   "4. Updated the WSDL2JavaTest.java. But still the compilation problem with ant javac is present.", 
   "5. Re factored a misspelled method name in the Schema classes."
