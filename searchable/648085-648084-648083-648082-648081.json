   "Initial commit of MAHOUT-15 introduces a variant of the Canopy cluster that uses an iterative approach to shift and merge canopies that are created for each original input point. As canopies shift and merge, they converge upon the modes of the input point density function and define the resulting clusters.", 
   "- MeanShiftCanopy.java: Defined by a center and a list of bound points. During each iteration, the canopies within their T1 radius are used to determine a weighted centroid which becomes the next canopy center. Canopies moving within their T2 radius are merged and the bound points are accumulated.", 
   "- MeanShiftCanopyMapper.java: The mapper reads input canopies and outputs information to the combiner that is used to shift and merge its canopies.", 
   "- MeanShiftCanopyCombiner.java: The combiner accumulates information about the mapper's canopies and outputs them in their new centroid positions.", 
   "- MeanShiftCanopyReducer.java: The reducer merges the outputs of multiple mapper/combiners and performs another shift merge iteration.",
