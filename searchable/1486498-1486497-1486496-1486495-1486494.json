   "Can successfully start, stop and restart reggie as a hosted application through the JMX interface.  Can also shut down the container through the JMX interface.  Currently, the container shutdown is not particularly clean - it notifies all components that shutdown is happening, but doesn't take into account any order of shutdown, or waiting for apps to close.  Currently ends with a System.exit(0).  However, it's probably good enough for many purposes."
