   "Added support for relative font config URLs (metrics-url and embed-url). These URLs are now resolved through the FOP config URI resolver. A new configuration item font-base has been added which defines the base URL to be used for resolution of the font URLs. If it is not given the normal FOP base URL is used. Unrelated to this feature the patch also contains a new image class (java 1.4 specific) for JPEG images. This is for renderers (e.g. AFP) which require access to the decoded JPEG."
