   "Fixing TestRemoteTable and TestHRegionServerFileSystemFailure broken by D336813", 
   "Summary:",

   "with time-outs. TestHRegionServerFileSystemFailure re-starts a master in the end", 
   "if it had crashed so that regionservers can shut down properly, but the", 
   "condition it uses to identify whether the master is still alive was no longer", 
   "valid, because there is now a thread object wrapping HMaster, and", 
   "master.isAlive() is meaningless. I replaced this with master.isClosed() and", 
   "removed hard-coded master class from the unit test.", 
   "TestRemoteTable started failing because of a bug in JVMClusterUtil.shutdown()", 
   "-- it did not call join() on master threads.", 
   "Also calling Thread.currentThread().interrupt() when handling", 
   "InterruptedException instead of simply ignoring it. This is recommended by Java", 
   "Concurrency in Practice as well as in other articles online as the proper way to", 
   "handle InterruptedException, but I must admit I don't fully understand why.", 
   "Test Plan: All 621 unit tests pass (compared to 614 without the patch).",
