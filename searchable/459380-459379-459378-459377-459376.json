   "Finished softcoding all wicket:xxx namespaced attributes in WebRequestCodingStrategy.  You can now rename them by changing the constant values in that class alone.  However if you were to change the encoding/decoding pattern, tests would break because there are still tests hardwired to the particular encoding we have chosen.  But this is certainly good enough for now and much better than what we had."
