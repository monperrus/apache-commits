   "[MNG-4167] Move version-expression transformation code out of ArtifactTransformation shell, into its own component that is used directly from the MavenProjectBuilder.", 
   "When a POM is loaded from a project directory (not from a repository), the last step before returning the project to the caller is to transform the artifact coordinate expressions and write the result to a temporary file set to delete on exit. The project isntance's file variable is then pointed to the temp file, to ensure that any plugins referencing the POM from the filesystem will get the transformed version."
