   "This change will allow us to handle having the same items multiple times in the list, for example \u201cRyan Frishberg\u201d can now be in the list twice.", 
   "In order to do it, rather than using the item to find the itemRenderer or to tell the list that an item\u2019s been selected, we need to use the index instead.  Methods like getItemRenderer and getRendererItem were changed to accept an index rather than an item.  Other methods were added, like isItemIndexSelected() because I felt isItemSelected() is still a useful method to have, even though it\u2019s ambiguous when multiple items come in to play.", 
   "For now, I just tried to change the parameters where needed.  Some of the names of the methods were updated to reflect the change, but others weren\u2019t because PARB is going to review a lot of this on Thursday, so it\u2019s easier to make a name change only once (and after PARB approves it).", 
   "I also added properties to ItemExistanceChangeEvent.as.  In a later checkin, I\u2019ll create a separate RendererExistanceChangeEvent.as for DataGroups and use ItemExistanceChangeEvents only for IVisualElementContainers (Halo containers  will also dispatch these events).  However, this needs to be PARB reviewed, so I figured it\u2019s best to hold off on this change until later.", 
   "Also included in this checkin are some small ASDoc updates to no longer use any of the \u201caddItem(), numItems\u201d, and instead use addElement() or numElements where appropriate.", 
   "QE Notes: Steve's excluded any failing tests.  As noted in the checkin, there will probably be some renaming related to these methods.  Also, add some tests for duplicate items now.",

   "Rename of flex -> mx.", 
   "For compatibility reasons it was decided that the new functionality remain integrated with the old framework, although we will continue to build two separate SWCs, one with primarily existing framework classes, and one with new Flex 4 classes. This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.  The naming overlap consists of two major areas:  New Components, and New Effects",
