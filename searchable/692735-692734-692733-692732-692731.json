   "Added missing models to FileUpload fields. This should fix the build (see http://wicketstuff.org/teamcity/viewLog.html?tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=bt2&buildId=1448 ).", 
   "However, I'm not sure how FileUploadField should work exactly. Should the constructor without a model throw an exception? Maybe not, because the model can be added after construction as well with setModel, and the code like the previous versions of these files should crash like it did.", 
   "- also added some missing Java 5 and Wicket 1.4 features in MockPageWithFormAndUploadField"
