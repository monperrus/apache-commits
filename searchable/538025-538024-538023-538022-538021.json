   "Updating the build.xml with a new maven ant. This fixes the copying from a cli2 directory, the repository location, an unnecessary jdepend dependency and all importantly, the version number. Thanks to Brian Egge in CLI-129 for this, though I ended up using his patch as a pointer to the parts of project.xml that needed fixing rather than a fix for the build.xml."
