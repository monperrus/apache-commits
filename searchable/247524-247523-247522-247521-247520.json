   "4) Small change to Call.setReturnType(xmlType, javaType).  The return class was", 
   "not being set on the OperationDesc correctly.", 
   "5) Small change to RPCElement so that the operation is always considered if wrapped.", 
   "Without this change no deserialization will take place for the", 
   "example above (since numParms==2 and getNumInParms()==1).", 
   "6) RPCHandler is changed to recognize the special collection qname that is", 
   "used for elements with maxOccurs=unbounded.  The RPCParam value is deserialized", 
   "as the proper component type.", 
   "So for the example above:", 
   "* two RPCParams will be created.", 
   "* the values will be the deserialized as Strings.", 
   "* both RPCParams will have the same qname and ParameterDesc.", 
   "7) An RPCElement:combineParams method is added to combine the", 
   "arguments of the same parameter into a container object", 
   "described by the ParameterDesc.", 
   "8) RPCProvider is changed to invoke combineParams before", 
   "obtaining the list of arguments for dispatching.", 
   "9) Call is changed to invoke combineParams before obtaining", 
   "the list of return arguments.",
