   "Fix for WOOKIE-169. The bug was caused by the script only listening to keyup events - the auto-complete function in the browser doesn't trigger it, but does trigger the change() event, so I've bound the validation action to both events. (Note:I also changed the input type to \"email\". This doesn't really make any difference except to iPhone and Opera users, who get a nicer interface)"
