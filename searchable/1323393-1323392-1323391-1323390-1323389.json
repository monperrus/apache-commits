   "A prototype for generating DefineFont4 tags from OpenType CFF font files for use in Flash Player 10. Currently this is limited to embedding the entire set of glyphs and only for OpenType CFF based files. Support for caching, subsetting and other file formats will be added later.", 
   "Since DefineFont4 is not a continuation of DefineFont2 or DefineFont3, this change required some refactoring in how Flex's FontTranscoder interacts with its FontManagers. Use of a helper FontBuilder class has been pushed down into the legacy FontManagers and Flex's FontTranscoder simply asks a FontManager to create the DefineFont tag directly. The CFFFontManager does not need to make use of FontBuilder and creates DefineFont4 instances directly.",
