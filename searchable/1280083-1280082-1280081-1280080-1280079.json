   "Swapped RichEditableText with RichEditableText2. This means that <s:RichEditableText>, <s:TextInput>, and <s:TextArea> are now based on TLF's InputManager. This should make them lighterweight than when they were based on TLF's FlowManager, because you don't have to pay for the cost of scrolling/selection/editing until you start using these features. (Basically, InputManager uses TLF's TextLineFactory if it doesn't need to use a FlowComposer.)",
