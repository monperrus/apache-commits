   "Added pre_capture subroutine to OS.pm. This is called as the first step from the Windows.pm and Linux.pm pre_capture subroutines. It checks to make sure the computer is responding. If not responding, it checks if the computer is powered off and attempts to power it on. OS::pre_capture also creates the currentimage.txt file so this step no longer needs to be done in every provisioning module's capture subroutine.", 
   "Also changed the timing of the wait_for_response call in Linux::post_load. It had been waiting 60 seconds for the computer to boot. Some computers take less time. Changed to 30 seconds."
