   "Adding a Velocity taglib for use in our Jelly scripts.  The taglib is", 
   "very basic.   It contains only one tag at the moment with only a few", 
   "options.  This was just a first pass at getting something working.", 
   "Basically, the tag takes a Velocity template, merges it with the current", 
   "JellyContext, and dumps the output to a file or stuffs it into a", 
   "variable in the JellyContext (similar to the <j:file> tag).", 
   "For example (taken from uberjar plugin):", 
   "<velocity:merge", 
   "name=\"${dest}/classworlds.conf\"", 
   "template=\"${plugin.dir}/src/conf/classworlds.conf\"/>", 
   "This uses the template specified by the 'template' attribute, and merges", 
   "it with the current JellyContext (containing all of the maven goodies),", 
   "and dumps the output to classworlds.conf.  Alternatively, the output", 
   "could have been dumped to a variable.  In addition, 'inputEncoding' and", 
   "'outputEncoding' attributes can be specified to set the encoding for the", 
   "template and output file respectively.", 
   "Thanks to James for the idea and slacking off on his day off so I could", 
   "write it before he got to it :-)"
