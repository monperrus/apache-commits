   "IO-161 try to fix OutOfMemoryError being thrown by FileCleaningTrackerTestCase in Gump and fix a potential *hanging* situation.", 
   "Remove the tracker from the list first. Theres a potential loop-for-ever situation if for some reason the delete fails because the Tracker will have been removed from the queue but still be in the List - and this method loops until the List is empty.", 
   "Hopefully this will also resolve the FileCleaningTrackerTestCase's OutOfMemoryError in Gump and Continuum. Its failing during the file.delete() operation - the test code to fill-up-memory continues until the Tracker List is zero."
