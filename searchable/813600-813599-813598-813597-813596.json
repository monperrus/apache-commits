   "OPENJPA-1260.  Committing this change for Ravi Palacherla.  Mike had previously reviewed the patch for correctness.  Ravi changed the patch slightly and re-submitted.  Based on a request from the mailing list, I reviewed Ravi's second patch and am committing the changes with a couple of minor modifications.  I updated the comments slightly to make sentences.  And, I moved the testcases to the \"generationtype\" package to be with similar testcases."
