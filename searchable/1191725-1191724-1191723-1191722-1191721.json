However, I was able to reduce the amount of data being passed from Java to JavaScript by 40% by decoding common characters that occur in JSON and XML.  These characters will survive the round trip just fine and don't need to be encoded.", 
   "This is the best solution I could come up with.  You won't be able to read files as large as you could in 0.9.4 but it will get close and it will support non-ascii characters."
