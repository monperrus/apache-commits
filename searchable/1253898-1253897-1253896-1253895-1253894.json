   "Add TLFTextInput which allows Halo controls to use the spark FTE/TLF-based TextInput component wherever a Halo TextInput can be used.",

   "Kerning is now enabled by default for Spark components, but remains disabled by default for Halo components.", 
   "This is accomplished by having the global selector set 'kerning' to a new value, \"default\". Spark components now interpret \"default\" as \"auto\", while Halo components interpret \"default\" as false.", 
   "In Beta 1, kerning was accidentally enabled in some Spark components; then it was deliberately disabled in all of them as an interim step. Now we're enabling it in all Spark components, which is what we want for Flex 4.0. A cyclone build of this change was performance-tested and showed no degradation.", 
   "Background info:", 
   "In Halo components based on TextField, kerning is supposed to be true or false. The default in TextField and Flex 3 is false because kerning doesn't work for device fonts and is slow for embedded fonts.", 
   "In Spark components based on TLF and FTE, kerning is \"auto\", \"on\", or, \"off\". The default in TLF and FTE is \"auto\"  (which means kern non-Asian characters) because kerning works even on device fonts and has miminal performance impact.", 
   "Since a CSS selector or parent container can affect both Halo and Spark components, we need to map \"auto\" and \"on\" to true and \"off\" to false for Halo components in UITextField and  UITLFTextField. For Spark components, SimpleText and CSSTextLayoutFormat, we do the opposite mapping of true to \"on\" and false to \"off\".", 
   "We will also now support a value of \"default\"  (which will be set in the global selector) to mean false for Halo and \"auto\" for Spark. This will enable developers  to get the recommended behavior in both sets of components.",
