   "Fix for a bug: After playing a hide effect, a window wouldn't be visible again.", 
   "The issue here is that all effects that occur because of HIDE end up calling setVisible() (see EffectManager.effectEndHandler).  Window/WindowedApplication was basically left with two concepts of setVisible...the displayObject one and the native application one, and they were out of synch.  So setting visible=true on the window wasn\u2019t calling setVisible(true) which controls the display object visibility.  Now instead of doing our work in the visible setter, we override setVisible() and do it in there.",
