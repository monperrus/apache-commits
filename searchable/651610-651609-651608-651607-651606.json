   "Comprehensive updating. ASF now uses a different form of header to that recommended for copyright holders so added explanation but removed all references to targetting anyone other than Apache projects. ASF does not use copyright assignment and so it is wrong to claim copyright on anything other than the collective work so removed all incorrect copyright claims. Legal affairs is responsible for policy in this area so pruned prose and added links into legal affairs website where matters are covered. Tightened prose - possibly too much (in the days of my youth I used to write too much and the original suffered from this flaw). Perhaps now I write too tightly so please jump if anything is too concise after these changes."
