   "-two new classes that must be present for jsse to be found. I could not get jikes1.1.6+java1.4 to build without adding more tests for things we are importing. That is wierd...either java1.4 is incomplete or jikes is playing up. Probably the latter -but since the extra classes probed for are implicit imports in JSSESocketFctory, this should not affect javac+jsse builds."
