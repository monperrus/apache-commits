   "Don't include frameworks/projects/*/bundles directories in the bin kit if there is no en_US subdirectory because copylocale looks for all bundles directories and then accesses the en_US subsirectory.  The makeApacheFlexForFlashBuilder scripts no longer download the Apache Flex SDK.  It assumes it is running from a bin package, or if from a source package, ant main has been called first.  It does a quick check to verify this - it looks for bin\\mxmlc.jar - an if  there it assumes the binaries are present."
