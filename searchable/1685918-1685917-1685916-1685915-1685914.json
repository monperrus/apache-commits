   "Remove equals and hashCode from OMAttribute implementations.", 
   "Rationale:", 
   "1. The fact that OMAttribute implementations support equals and hashCode is not mentioned in the Javadoc of the public API.", 
   "2. The implementation uses the following condition:", 
   "return (namespace == null ? other.getNamespace() == null :", 
   "namespace.equals(other.getNamespace()) &&", 
   "localName.equals(other.getLocalName()) &&", 
   "(value == null ? other.getAttributeValue() == null :", 
   "value.equals(other.getAttributeValue())));", 
   "This is wrong. Since the ternary operator has lower precedence than &&, this code will compare the local names and values only if the attribute has a namespace. Sure enough the existing test case didn't test this code on attributes without namespace. Since the code is so badly broken and nobody ever complained, it is safe to assume that nobody actually relies on OMAttribute implementing equals and hashCode.", 
   "3. It is hard to see what the use case for this feature would be."
