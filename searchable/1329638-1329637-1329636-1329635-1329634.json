   "Split the maven folder into two child folders 'subprojects' and 'war'.  Under here all maven artifacts will use the license/notice files found under 'subprojects' - namely the connector, the parser and any -src, -doc zips created.  The maven war artifact is almost the same as the top level war, except that the maven war additionally needs to include the derby jar (and associated license/notice files) - hence why it now has it own folder."
