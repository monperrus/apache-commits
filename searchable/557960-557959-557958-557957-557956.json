   "Initial code drop of the Geronimo NetBeans Plugin", 
   "The code is based on the article \"NetBeans Server-Skeleton Module Tutorial\" [1] that Stepan Herold from the NetBeans (serverplugins module) team sent me as a starting point.", 
   "The plugin provides no deployment code so no project can be deployed on Geronimo yet. Honestly, it's not useable at all - just a couple of classes that let you think Geronimo's registered, but it's not. An icon is there and that's it.", 
   "The missing pieces as far as the previous version of the Geronimo NetBeans Plugin goes are filling in the wizards to create a configured Geronimo server and deployment stuff. Soon to be added.",
