   "This Gump build file is terribly broken.  The Apache Struts project no longer represents a single framework.  We now have 3 seperate project.  Action 1, Shale, and Tiles.  And Action 2.0 is such a radical change, this file is completely useless for that purpose anyway.  At this point, the nag messages are basically spam.  Until someone steps up to help with our gump build, I am disabling all of the projects here."
