   "TRINIDAD-1471: Portlet 2.0 Support for Trinidad", 
   "* Extending ExternalContextUtils to support the RequestType Enumeration like in commons-utils as well as add support for Portlet 2.0 request types. I decided to add this code to the Trinidad specific API as opposed to using commons so that the upgrade will be easier. We should look into a project to start consuming commons.", 
   "* Updated pluto profile in demo to build a Pluto compatible war. This will now correctly build a Pluto compatible demo war for either Pluto 1.x or Pluto 2.x depending on the setting of the -Dportlet=2.0 flag. By default it will build a war compatible with Pluto 1.x. Invoking Portlet 2.0 will add a snapshot dependency as Pluto 2.0 is not yet released. Because this is governed by a property, this should not effect the ability to release Trinidad", 
   "* Added a pluto-embedded profile that will allow you to run the Trinidad Demo, in jetty, using Pluto 1.x.. This does not currently work with the -Dportlet=2.0 flag because the pluto-embedded plugin has some issues.", 
   "* Changed api and impl packages to compile against Portlet 2.0 objects instead of Portlet 1.0", 
   "* Updated Configurators to support both Portlet 1.0 and Portlet 2.0 so that either container can be used and capabilities are modified accordingly", 
   "* Legacy wrappers for Portlet 1.0 Request/Response objects were removed. Porltet 1.0 Request/Response wrapping is now handled using Java Proxy objects. Portlet 2.0 request/response wrapping uses and created new Portlet 2.0 wrapper objects where appropriate", 
   "* Updated XmlHttpConfigurator to be a proper Configurator and took out several hacks, also added support for ResourceRequest/Response to support AJAX in Portlet 2.0 containers"
