   "DERBY-2152: Clean-up patch that does the following:", 
   "1. Creates a new \"init()\" method for NewInvocationNode that is specifically", 
   "targeted for mapping VTI \"tables\" and VTI \"table functions\" to their", 
   "corresponding class names. The new init() method takes both a TableDescriptor", 
   "and a TableName, exactly one of which must be null. If the TableDescriptor", 
   "is null then we will resolve the TableName to a VTI \"table function\"; if the", 
   "TableName is null then we will resolve the TableDescriptor to a VTI \"table\".", 
   "Thus VTI classes are now consistently resolved inside the NewInvocationNode", 
   "class.", 
   "2. Updates NodeFactory.mapTableAsVTI() to make use of the new \"init()\"", 
   "method in NewInvocationNode. mapTableAsVTI() used to take as a parameter the", 
   "resolved VTI class name; now it just passes the received TableDescriptor to", 
   "the new init() method in NewInvocationNode and the latter resolves the VTI", 
   "class.", 
   "3. Combines the getVTIClassForTable() and getVTIClassForTableFunction()", 
   "methods of DataDictionary into a new method, \"getVTIClass()\", that takes a", 
   "TableDescriptor and a boolean value. The boolean indicates the kind of", 
   "mapping to do--\"table\" or \"table function\"--while the TableDescriptor holds", 
   "the schema and name information used for resolving the class. This resolves", 
   "the inconsistency between the argument styles used in the old getVTIClassFor*()", 
   "methods."
