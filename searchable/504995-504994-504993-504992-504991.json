   "Added new annotation attribute to ConnectionOptions annotation, 'useExternalConnection'.  Defaults to false, if set to true, a Jdbc system control will not try to acquire/release the connection specified in its ConnectionDatasource/ConnectionDriver annotation.  The Jdbc connection is provided via the setConnection API. 99% of this behavior already existed in the JDBC control, this change (consisting of 3 new lines of source code) allows users to take advantage of it.   Should be quite useful for JUnit testing of controls in the ControlTestContainer.  See the updated unit test for an example of usage."
