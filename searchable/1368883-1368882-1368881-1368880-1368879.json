   "I think it might be a good idea to use a non-M?-SNAPSHOT designator to prevent", 
   "weirdness with trunk or other branches. I began updating this until I ran into", 
   "the compilation problem in the hub core. I thought I did something wrong, then", 
   "later I realized that it had not been backported to M4."
