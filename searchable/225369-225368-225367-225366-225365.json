   "Contribution from Chad Schoettger that fixes a bunch of issues with the service control and adds additional web service tests.",

   "I've finished a first pass for system control DRTs. In this patch includes new DRTs for RPC literal and encoded style services and well as a number of fixes for DOC style services/tests. I have also added a DRT suite for testing headers.", 
   "The DRT framework has been modified to now verify that the WSDL's for the DRTs are what we excpect by starting tomcat and getting the WSDLs for the services we are testing against and comparing them to the ones in the DRT area. If this check fails, the DRTs will fail. I found that this was quite helpful in diagnosing DRT issues when they failed.",
