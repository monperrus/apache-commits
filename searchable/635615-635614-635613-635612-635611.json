   "[MNG-3415] Adding an integration test to make sure metadata files aren't written when TransferFailedException happens during metadata resolution, and that the file used for updateInterval calculations (metadata file in 2.0.x and resolver-status.properties in 2.1.x) is NOT updated on successive builds inside that updateInterval. Finally, updating AbstractMavenIntegrationTest to allow matching of specific version ranges on-demand, to allow tests to adjust things like the updateInterval check-file...this is not ideal, but provides smaller code changes and maintenance overhead than duplicating unit test classes for this behavior."
