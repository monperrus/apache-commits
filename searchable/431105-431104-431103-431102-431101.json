   "annoyingly fix indentation to 2 spaces; allow up to 200 rules per .c file and yylexer tree; use function name prefixes so that multiple modules can be loaded at once without stepping in each others namespaces; use unsigned char as the type so that UTF-8 strings can be matched; allow multiple patterns to match per input line; remove a superfluous .c and .h file; put the scanner main function directly in the .xs file, and change it to return an array of the multiple keys that are hit; remove Exporter, since there's no need for these modules to fiddle with the main package; support quoted dblquotes and a few more chars in the pattern; allow fixup_re() to give up on an over-complex pattern without killing the entire script"
