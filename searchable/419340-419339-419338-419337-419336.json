   "Added machinery to go along with Dojo's preferred technique of setting values for widgets on creation; they are as a result deficient in setters, and so it seemed at least worth a try to do this, though we'll have to get setters written at some point.  (This was suggested by getting a FloatingPane::setTitle written which worked well in Mozilla but was rubbish in IE; creating the widget with the right title worked fine under both browsers---being able to reset the title later is of secondary concern, and shouldn't block us at this point.)"
