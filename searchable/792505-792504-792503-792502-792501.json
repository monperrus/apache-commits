   "o Injected Kiran's patch to move AVL serialization inside JDBM", 
   "o Added synchronization in JDBMStore for modification operations and sync()", 
   "o The JDBM byte buffers are copied before being returned to the caller, to avoid a modification", 
   "made on a reference", 
   "o Fixed some double update of the oneLevel index (no need to add a (id,id) entry)", 
   "o When we can't find the entry, instead of a NPE, an error 32 is generated (NO_SUCH_OBJECT)", 
   "o Minor cleanup in JdbmTable", 
   "o Added some logs in JdbmTable", 
   "o Added some traces if the AVL Tree deserializer detect some bad tree"
