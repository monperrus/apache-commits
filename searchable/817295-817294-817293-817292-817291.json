   "FailoverBaseCase has not been using the testprofile defined test.port.alt for the failover server. As a result the connection has been failing. Updated to use correct system property and added text to both default.testprofile and test-provider.properties to ensure that the changes are made in both locations, Ideally JNDI connection would use the same system property that is used by QTC for starting the broker. However I don't believe that it is currently doing that."
