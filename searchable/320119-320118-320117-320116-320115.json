   "When an annotation has no <documentation> or <appinfo> children we were", 
   "completely losing the annotation component. This is because the schema DOM", 
   "stores the textual representation of the annotation on the first child of the", 
   "current parent. When <annotation> has element content, that's its first", 
   "child. When <annotation> has no element content, that's its parent's first", 
   "child. The latter is problematic because only if the annotation is the first", 
   "child of its parent will we find the text node there. We need to store the", 
   "string representation in a consistent place so it can be reliably retrieved,", 
   "perhaps as user data.  In the mean time we look for a text child on", 
   "annotation if it has no element content. This works for a large number of", 
   "cases but not all of them."
