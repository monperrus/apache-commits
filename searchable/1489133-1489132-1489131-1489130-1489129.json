   "ACCUMULO-935 Enabled creating an external directory for outputting build artifacts, so that the workspace doesn't get dirtied with unversioned files, whose exceptions in svn:ignore, .gitignore, rpm profile, deb profile, and tarball profiles, are becoming unwieldy to maintain and keep consistent, and which are interfering with things like the source assembly and the rat check plugins.", 
   "To use, add desired output directory on the command line with something like: -DDEV_ACCUMULO_HOME=/var/tmp/ACCUMULO_HOME (or define in a profile in your settings.xml file to be turned on by default)", 
   "ACCUMULO-1029, ACCUMULO-1431 Remove unnecessary ignored items from svn and git - some stuff may still need to be modified in ACCUMULO-935 so that it doesn't need to be re-added to the ignore (eg. modify script to read out of target/ or from DEV_ACCUMULO_HOME property, etc.)", 
   "ACCUMULO-1270 Require rat checks on every build; nothing should be dirty and need extra ignoring anymore"
