   "Merged the <xtags:document> and <xtags:parse> tags together. Also allow the <xtags:parse> tag to take a url parameter for a full URL or a uri parameter for a relative URI to the web application. The uri can be absolute /foo.xml or can be relative to the current JSP file. So the uri=foo.xml might be converted to uri=/bar/foo.xml if the tag was used in a JSP file called /bar/test.jsp. Added test cases to show the relative URI working on Tomcat 3.3 and latest nightly build of 4.0 dev. Also I've fixed a bug in the <xtags:copyOf> such that it now works when the context is the current document. Also tidied up the implementation code somewhat"
