   "o Revert r586732 because it breaks the velocity template functionality. This code changes the output filenames of these files so that they are different than before. An example of this is https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/site/trunk/src/site/apt/download.apt.vm, which with this code gets the output filename download.apt.html instead of download.html."
