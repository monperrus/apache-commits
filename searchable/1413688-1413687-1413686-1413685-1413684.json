   "First pass in the last step of the removal of automatically generated pages from Confluence from the OFBiz website:", 
   "* moved a bunch of links to Confluence-based documents from the index.html page to the documentation.html page where it is clearly mentioned that they refer to the Wiki", 
   "* several links to Confluence-based pages now open the page in a new browser tab: this should help the user understand what is from the site and what is from Confluence", 
   "* removed the Confluence search box from the header and moved to the documentation.html page where it is clearly stated that it is a form for Wiki searches", 
   "* converted two Confluence-based documents (\"Getting Started\" and \"Project Overview\") to static html pages; thanks to Olivier Heintz for the contribution (OFBIZ-5077, OFBIZ-5078); this commit contains a slightly modified version of the work contributed by Olivier;", 
   "* the new documents are now \"children\" of the main documentation.html page", 
   "* cleaned up and improved page <title/> elements", 
   "* fixed some formatting"
