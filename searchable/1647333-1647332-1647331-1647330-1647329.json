   "COMPRESS-296 Parallel compression. Added StreamCompressor and ScatterZipOutputStream.", 
   "StreamCompressor is an extract of the deflation algorithm from ZipArchiveOutputStream, which unfortunately", 
   "was too conflated with writing a file in a particular structure. Using the actual zip file format as an", 
   "intermediate format for scatter-streams turned out to be fairly inefficient. ScatterZipOuputStream", 
   "is 2-3x faster than using a zip file as intermediate format.", 
   "It would be possibly to refactor ZipArchiveOutputStream to use StreamCompressor, but there would", 
   "be a slight break in backward compatibility regarding the protected writeOut method, which", 
   "is moved to the streamCompressor class."
