   "THRIFT-409. java: Add \"union\" to Thrift", 
   "This patch introduces new IDL syntax for creating Unions, explicityly single-valued structs. While the parser changes are portable, this patch only includes the actual generated code changes for the Java library. Other libraries can continue to generate a struct with the same fields and remain compatible until they are able to implement the full shebang."
