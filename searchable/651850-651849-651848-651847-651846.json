   "A better fix than SVN r651796 for the issue where node.stop() doesn't release Jetty/Tomcat servers. Instead of stopping the whole runtime, we just stop the composite loaded in the runtime, like before, but the Jetty and Tomcat servers now release the HTTP ports in removeServletMapping(), which is more symmetric too with the logic allocating the ports in addServletMapping()."
