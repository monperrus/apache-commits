   "Bugzilla 4601: Change ElemNumber to use a long integer for the value of the number. This will allow us to format bigger numbers. As far as japanese multipliers, we decided to document as a xalan limitation the fact that the last 2 japanese multipliers will not be supported. If anyone has a strong and valid user case for this, we will reconsider. For now, we could not justify the expense of moving to BigInteger to support these multipliers."
