   "Ripped-and-replaced web unit tests and replaced with Selenium. Selenium test directory structure replaced with a patched selenium-server-0.9.2.jar. Web tests are yet not at parity with old (failing) JWebUnit tests, they are pretty good for a start. Many thanks to Dirk to figuring out the minor patches we needed to get Selenium to work nicely with Mootools. Removed all traces of JMeter, HttpUnit and JWebUnit (as much as I could find, anyway). Re-based Selenium tests to tests/etc/selenium/tests."
