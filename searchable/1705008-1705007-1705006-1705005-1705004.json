   "In all releases the code in ProductSummary.groovy tries to collect prices for variants. Doing so it use NumberFormat.format() to transform base price into string that is part of an embed JS snippet. In case purchase order this price is rather empty. Using null with formatting method cause error. You may see this error in the trunk if you starts PO and and try Browser Categories->Widgets->Small Widgets. This price should appear if you select Select Units of Measure for WG-1111 but currently this does not work.",
