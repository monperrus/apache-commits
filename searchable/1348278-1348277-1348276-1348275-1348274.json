   "DERBY-5578 Provide a way to invalidate stored prepared statements", 
   "Commiting changes for adding a new procedure(SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INVALIDATE_STORED_STATEMENTS) which will allow users to invalidate all the stored statements inside SYS.SYSSTATEMENTS. At this point, there are only two types of stored statements in SYS.SYSSTATEMENTS system table - statements for metadata calls and statements for trigger action plans. I have also added test cases including the regression tests and upgrade tests. Upgrade tests show that this procedure is available only after hard upgrade. Regression test show how the procedure can be executed only by dba unless dba grants execute permission to other users. Additionally, it has test cases showing statements getting invalidated by the procedure call and subsequent execution of metadata call or trigger causing their corresponding statements to become valid.", 
   "Since these changes fiddle around with system tables, this jira can't be backported to released branches."
