   "Work on supporting installed packages, more fixing for GUMP-138, fix GUMP-139.", 
   "*  metadata/profile.xml: refer to xml-apis. We're still not bootstrapping as seemingly we need xalan as well (for ant).", 
   "* pygump/python/gump/model/__init__.py: add the concept of a 'local' repository and module, which basically are 'installed packages'.", 
   "* pygump/python/gump/engine/normalizer.py: fix GUMP-139 by not creating clones, thus keeping the ability to look up the tree for parent repositories/modules. This makes the codebase a little more fragile, but the alternative would mean writing a lot more code and doing expensive copying of lots of DOM data.", 
   "* pygump/python/gump/engine/objectifier.py: add support for the new 'local' repositories and modules. Put modules in a newly created 'default repository' if no containing repository can be found, which is a local repository that should probably be pointing at /usr/local/gump/packages or a similar location."
