   "fix org.apache.kahadb.journal.JournalTest.testBatchWriteCompleteAfterClose() after changes for AMQ-2143, the file and offset in a location are set after an enqueue to a write batch, so doing the inflight add just overwrote the same entry, -1:-1. Which fixed the leak but broke inflights, proper fix is to do the inflight addition in enqueue, just after the location details are known and with a lock on appender enqueue"
