   "SDK-19585 - Menus compiled with the halo theme in Flex 4 have a different backgroundColor than in Flex 3",

   "SDK-19651 - odd header rendering issue on Halo DataGrid with Gumbo skin", 
   "QA Notes: The alert layout code was positioning the buttons/text on sub-pixel boundaries if the width or height of the alert was an odd number of pixels. We always snap to pixel boundaries now, but this may cause bitmap compare issues with Alert.",
