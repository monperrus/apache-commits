   "THRIFT-166. java: Java tests should be in lib/java/test/", 
   "THRIFT-221. java: Make java build classpath more dynamic and configurable", 
   "This issue moves all the tests from test/java to lib/java/test/src and combines the build files. In addition, rather than continue on with the same busted approach to finding dependent jars for the tests, THRIFT-221 has been implemented, allowing the user to specify a .thrift-build.properties file in their home directory that contains additional classpath entries.", 
   "As a result of this patch, \"make check\" does not currently work as it is expected to. This will be resolved in a follow-up commit."
