   "WICKET-3690 Session is invalidated more than once because Session.sessionInvalidated is not reset", 
   "Moved the invocation of Session#detach() after the RequestCycleListener's #onDetach(). This way there is no need of RCL for the session detaching and it is executed always after the other listeners.", 
   "This way it looks like in 1.4 - there Session#detach() is called at the last step of RequestCycle#detach() - #threadDetach().", 
   "Unit tests pass.", 
   "Authentication and authorization examples work as expected.", 
   "Our application also works as expected even without null-ifying the 'sessionInvalidated' flag."
