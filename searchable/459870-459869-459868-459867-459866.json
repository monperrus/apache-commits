   "MarkupContainers may now override template loading per instance instead of only per application.", 
   "This is useful in situations where the loading differs from the rest of the components - e.g. it has to", 
   "be loaded from a database - without imposing additional need to configure the application for it (and thus", 
   "in the process breaking it's encapsulation).", 
   "Also added custom resource loading example to wicket-examples which shows three different ways."
