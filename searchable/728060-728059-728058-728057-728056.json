   "This addresses the button visibility issue in a slightly different way, by ensuring ensuring the dialog increases its size to match the contents if the (now increased ) default is not large enough. It also centre's the dialog correctly, and does not allow it to be resized by the user. The same approach is applied to the Reconnect dialog, which suffers similar issues.", 
   "In addition, the patch incorporates Enter/Escape keyboard functionality in the dialogs, as per QPID-1531"
