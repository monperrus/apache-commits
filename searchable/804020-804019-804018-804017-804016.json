   "Closing the XMLStreamWriter in serialize methods that write to an InputStream or Writer should not be an optional operation. If we don't do it in the serialize method, nobody will ever close the XMLStreamWriter. Note that there is no valid reason not to close the XMLStreamReader. In particular, closing the XMLStreamWriter has no impact on the underlying stream. Therefore we should always do it so that the StAX implementation can free the resources associated with the writer."
