   "HADOOP-3136. Fixed the default scheduler to assign multiple tasks to each tasktracker per heartbeat, when feasible. To ensure locality isn't hurt too badly, the scheudler will not assign more than one off-switch task per heartbeat. The heartbeat interval is also halved since the task-tracker is fixed to no longer send out heartbeats on each task completion. A slow-start for scheduling reduces is introduced to ensure that reduces aren't started till sufficient number of maps are done, else reduces of jobs whose maps aren't scheduled might swamp the cluster."
