   "A patch from Jeroen van der Wal \"When audit log is enabled it creates log transactions even when there are no changes\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4076) - OFBIZ-4076", 
   "The createEntittyAuditLogSingle function creates a record in the AuditLog entity even when there's no change. This patch only logs new, changed and deleted values. Also, all changes in the same transaction will get the same change date.", 
   "After applying this patch the overhead of the AuditEntityLog is recuded from 32% to 25%.", 
   "There's even more room for performance increase: a findOne search for the previous entity is done for every field that's enabled."
