   "We have improved keyboard navigation for layouts, but this unfortunately broke keyboard navigation for DropDownList while it is closed. Since neither the layout or the dataGroup is available when the DropDownList is closed, I\u2019ve decided to go back to handling the keyboard navigation directly in DDL. Previously, it had been using List\u2019s keyboard handling (which in turn, relies on layout).", 
   "Keyboard navigation now works similar to vertical layout\u2019s keyboard nav. UP and DOWN keys change the selectedIndex up or down. HOME sets selectedIndex to 0. END sets it to the last item. PAGE_UP moves the selectedIndex up 5 spots, while PAGE_DOWN moves it down 5 spots. The page size is defined by an mx_internal static property.",
