   "TUSCANY-3283 - these are similar changes to those made in 1.x to correct WSDL gen in various areas including, generating unannotated types into the service interface namespace, making wrapper parameters generally non-nillable, using JAXB to generate wrapper XSD (which fixes other failures where our code doesn't support various JAXB annotations), correcting the namespace of generated exceptions and the way that the generated classes are cached. Fixing the WSDL requires other fixes, for example, a new databinding to force ServiceReference to map to anyType (so that we don't try and process these interfaces with JAXB) and a fix to correct the order of response holders.
