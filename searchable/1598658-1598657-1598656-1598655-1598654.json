   "QPID-5795: [Java Broker] Prevent ConnectionAdapter leak when closing a messaging connection", 
   "The leak was due to the fact that nothing was telling the virtualhost to unregister the connection child (#unregisterChild)", 
   "when the connection was closed.", 
   "* Made ConnectionAdapter responsible for causing its own deletion (when the underlying connection is closed).  The call to #deleted() causes the child", 
   "to be unregistered from its parent (preventing the leak)", 
   "* Removed the now unnecessary _connectionAdapters map from the VH.  This needlessly duplicated information already held more generally by the ACO.", 
   "* Refactored SessionAdapter in sympathy with CA changes.  SessionsAdapters where _not_ being leaked as the session implementation were already telling the model to delete."
