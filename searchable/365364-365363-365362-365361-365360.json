   "Jakob's patch applied. @see http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-1164#action_12361517", 
   "The changes (copied from Jakob's comment):", 
   "+ Moved the deployer-configurable properties from maven.xml to project.properties", 
   "+ Changed the geronimo artifact id used in unpackServer from the tomcat distribution to the jetty distribution, as I experienced some problems with the Tomcat distro.", 
   "+ Added dependencies for geronimo-javamail-transport-1.0.jar, and added them to the list of jars being copied manually in the unpackServer goal", 
   "+ Moved around some of the properties in the configuration of the MailGBean and SMTPTransportGBean. It seems that the SMTPTransportGBean isn't necessary, so I have removed it.", 
   "Great job! Thanks Jakob!"
