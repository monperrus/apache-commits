   "- In a previous patch I submitted, a bug was inadvertently issued. Removing existing headers using SOAPHeaderElement.extractHeaderElements(String) does not do what I intended to do. Here is a fix patch (and a test that checks that).", 
   "- WS-Addressing handler while processing reply messages, do not set a 'To' header if no Reply-To was specified in the incoming message. This is a violation of the spec since To header elements are mandatory in WS-Addressing messages. The patch fixes this."
