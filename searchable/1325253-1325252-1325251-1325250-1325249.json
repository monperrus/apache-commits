   "Modified Groovy service engine and Groovy event handler to act in the same way of the \"Script\" (JSR 223) engine and handler: now they can execute the same exact Grrovy services and events.", 
   "In order to use these engine and event rather than the one that uses JSR223:", 
   "* for services (service definition): set the engine to \"groovy\" rather than \"script\"", 
   "* for events (event element in the controller): set the event type to \"groovy\" rather than \"script\"", 
   "The main advantage of using them is that it is possible to attach a debugger to the Groovy methods."
