   "Merged r980242 (Maven site refactoring) to the 1.5 branch. Since r980242 involved an svn move of the site files, this actually copies these files from the trunk, including all changes on the trunk before r980242 (see [1] for an explanation of why this is so). This is actually what we want since all these changes also apply to the 1.5 branch (there have been no site changes related to code changes that only exist on the trunk).",
