   "New fix for PLUTO-554: Infinite invocation when a view page of a portlet tries to include some result from other servlet path.", 
   "See: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PLUTO-554", 
   "This fix is compliant with the JSR-286 TCK and also now properly supports ServletContext.getRequestDispatcher instead of only request.getRequestDispatcher", 
   "As an important note: the current implementation is very much written and tested against Tomcat", 
   "and we already know this will *not* work correctly on other webcontainers like Jetty or Websphere...", 
   "Please see the PLUTO-554 issue and possible related/follow up issues for dealing with that."
