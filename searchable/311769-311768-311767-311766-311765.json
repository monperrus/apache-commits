   "- ChainsawCyclicBufferTableModel now ignores duplicate events (they must be identical, including properties -specifically a log4jid must be provided- and timestamp).", 
   "- Also updated jdbcreceiver to support a refreshMillis param which, if set, will re-execute the SQL retrieve statement every refreshMillis milliseconds.", 
   "- The combined benefit of these two changes makes JDBCReceiver a valuable receiver for use with Chainsaw.", 
   "- Events can be directly logged to a database and Chainsaw will only insert new events into the tablemodel."
