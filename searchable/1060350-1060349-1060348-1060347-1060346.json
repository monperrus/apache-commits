   "[STANBOL-22] changed implementation of the geonames.org based location enhancement engine to use an own JSON based client instead of the modified version of the official java client. This solves STANBOL-22 because the forked code from geonames.org is no longer needed and removed.", 
   "In addition it is now possible to use the geonames.org engine with premium accounts. To do that it is now possible to configure the server URL, username and token via the OSGI properties. However I was not able to test this new feature, because I do not own a premium account.", 
   "BugFix:", 
   "- added metatype.properties for the LocationEnhancementEngine", 
   "Additional Note:", 
   "The free geonames.org service is currently most of the time overloaded. Because of that this Engine is currently most of the time not functional. Users will notice IOExceptions with Messages like \"the free servers are currently overloaded with requests.\" in the logs. Note that such Exception will cause the whole enhancement process to fail (see also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STANBOL-8).",
