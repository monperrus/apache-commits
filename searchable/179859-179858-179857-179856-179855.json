   "DERBY-121 - Network Server issue reading blob/clob data size", 
   "1) Change Network Server and Derby Client code to do correct bit-shifting when processing the length of LOBs that are larger than 2^24 bytes (DERBY-121). 2) Add a new suite, \"largeData\", for running tests that require extra machine resources, and add the test for DERBY-121 to that suite (because the test for DERBY-121 requires extra heap memory for the server's JVM).",
