   "Added support for static reactions (targetless transitions in SCXML spec). Added unit test for this. Passes state pattern, but not enumerated patterns. The reason for this is a bug in the implementation of the flattening algorithm, and I think extends beyond the task of implementing support for static reactions. Next commit will fix this bug.", 
   "Also, added support for disabling tasks related to code generation when running tests in Ant. Created a properties file to facilitate this."
