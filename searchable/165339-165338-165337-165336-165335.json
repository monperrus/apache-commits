   "So the root of the problem is that if there are sourcepaths rooted in subdirs of the srcdir, (for example, if the srcdir is <webapp-root> and <webapp-root>\\WEB-INF\\src is a sourcepath), then corresponding subdirs in the gendir need to be added to the sourcepath (ie, <gen-dir>\\WEB-INF\\src needs to be on the sourcepath).", 
   "This can get a little involved to cover comprehensively, because it really needs to loop over all srcdirs and all sourcepaths looking for overlap. I've added code to handle the simple cases for webapps (single srcdir, all sourcepaths are subdirs of the srcdir)."
