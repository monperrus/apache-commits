   "* Removed datagram package which is too outdated", 
   "* Removed ReadBuffer and WriteBuffer and replaced them with simple ByteBuffers", 
   "* Replaced IoSession.getWriteBuffer()... buf.flush() to IoSession.write() methods. (Now we need some write buffer pooling mechanism here)", 
   "* Removed markerReleased() event handler.  dataWritten method now passes marker instead.", 
   "* Added ProtocolEncoderOutput which provides a kind of output stream to ProtocolEncoder.  (This change is related with new IoSession.write() methods)", 
   "Performance is better and API is simpler and UDP friendly."
