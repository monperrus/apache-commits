   "Removed very old functionality for form widget field actions entity-and and entity-condition that put their results automatically in the context with the field name from the form's list-name attribute, causing it to overwrite any existing list that might be in place for that; the effect was that you could not have any entity-and or entity-condition actions other than the one for the list or multi form's main list to iterate over; the proper way to do this for years now has been to specify which list you want, and this functionality was from the original approach where it was assumed for multi and list forms that you would only have one such query in the actions (which was an add-on to the original functionality that I never liked)"
