   "Added support for page and step scrolling in Scroller.  The workhorse",

   "verticalScrollPositionDelta(unit:uint):Number", 
   "horizontalScrollPositionDelta(unit:uint):Number", 
   "The \"scrolling unit\" parameter is a flash.ui.Keyboard constant, one of", 
   "UP/DOWN (LEFT,RIGHT) PAGE_UP,DOWN, HOME,END.  Adding the delta value", 
   "to the corresponding IViewport scroll position property produces the", 
   "scroll.  For example:", 
   "var dy:Number = vp.verticalScrollPositionDelta(Keyboard.PAGE_DOWN);", 
   "vp.verticalScrollPosition += dy;", 
   "This example scrolls IViewport vp down by a page.  The API is defined", 
   "in terms of \"delta\" offsets, rather than just adjusting the scroll", 
   "position directly, to make it easy to animate the scroll position", 
   "properties.", 
   "The implementation of these methods in the layout classes deals with", 
   "variable size rows/columns, partial visibility, etc.  For example, if", 
   "you page down in a VerticalLayout when the current last row is only", 
   "partially visible, then adding the verticalScrollPositionDelta to the", 
   "verticalScrollPosition will top justify the last row.  If the last row", 
   "is completely visible, then the delta is bigger: enough to top justify", 
   "the row _below_ the current last row.", 
   "Presently the Scroller's scrollbars do not support page/step", 
   "scrolling per the new API.  One can only drive the new API", 
   "with the keyboard, and then only when some descendant of the", 
   "viewport has the focus.", 
   "Note also: in the next version of this code, the scrollPositionDelta methods", 
   "will be defined by IViewport.",
