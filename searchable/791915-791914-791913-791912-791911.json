   "Removed allow_remote_access() sub and added command to set the registry key to firewall_enable_rdp() and firewall_enable_rdp_private().  Removed call to allow_remote_access() in pre_capture().  This ensures that the fDenyTSConnections registry key is properly set whenever RDP is enabled.", 
   "Fixed bug in filesystem_entry_exists().  It had been using ls to determine if a file exists.  This fails if the file is hidden.  The pagefile.sys file is an example.  It was reporting that the file didn't exist even though it did.  Changed sub to use cmd.exe /c dir.", 
   "VCL-65", 
   "Added get_volume_list() sub.  Added call to get_volume_list() from disable_pagefile().  It now attempts to delete a pagefile.sys file from all drives instead of just C:.  Images containing multiple partitions may contain pagefiles on other drives.  Not removing these causes images to be larger than necessary."
