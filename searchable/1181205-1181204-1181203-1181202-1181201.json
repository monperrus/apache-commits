   "QPID-3534, QPID-3535: make 0-8/0-9/0-9-1 client path simply close the underlying NetworkConnection instead of sending an erroneous ConnectionClose body after replying to the ConnectionClose from the broker or receving an unsupported protocol verison during initial connection negotiation. Stops the client making 2 seperate attempts to initiate failover, and removes possibility of the exception that can currently cause both of them to be skipped.",
