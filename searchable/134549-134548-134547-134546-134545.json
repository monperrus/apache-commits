   "* Factored out the authentication challenge processing logic from the",

   "headers are never overwritten", 
   "* Introduced a new class called AuthState that represents the", 
   "authentication process state that contains all the authentication", 
   "details. Basically it is just a convenience wrapper around the", 
   "authentication scheme interface.", 
   "* Proxy and host authentication state objects moved to the HTTP method", 
   "level, so that they can be queried by the user to find out the details", 
   "about authentication that has been performed by the HttpMethodDirector.", 
   "With the current implementation all the details of proxy and host", 
   "authentication are contained within the HttpMethodDirector instance,",

   "HttpMethodDirector instance gets GCed along with the authentication",
