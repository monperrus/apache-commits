   "Fixed a bug in GDate.getMillisecond() whereby if the value contained fractions of a millisecond, it got rounded, which in some cases (999.9 milliseconds for example) produced an invalid millisecond value (1000 in that case with milliseconds being restricted to 0-999). Used truncate instead of round to make sure the millisecond value stays in bounds."
