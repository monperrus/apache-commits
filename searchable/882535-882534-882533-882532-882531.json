   "Applied patch from Mukesh Marathe to remove the error message from costcenter page after short duration.", 
   "Steps to reproduce:", 
   "Go to - https://localhost:8443/accounting/control/CostCenters", 
   "-- Enter the values for cost center 1, 2 and 3 so that the total is not equals to 100.", 
   "-- The error appears on click submit, now correct the values in respective fields so total is equals to 100.", 
   "-- On click on submit the values save in the DB, but error still shows on the page - remove error message after short duration.",
