   "FXG stroke and fill translation fix", 
   "http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-23257 - Gradient translation should occur from 0,0, not the upper left bounds", 
   "The current API only passes in the shape's bounds. I have added a new targetOrigin parameter to IFill.begin, IStroke.apply and IStroke.createGraphicsStroke of type Point. It is the origin (0,0) of the shape in the target graphic's coordinate space.", 
   "Changed the logic in the gradient stroke and fills. The x and y transform properties are now positioned relative to the origin instead of to the top left corner of the bounds. If no x and y are set, then the default behavior remains the same.",
