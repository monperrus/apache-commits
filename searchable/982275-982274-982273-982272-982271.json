   "o Refactored the DnNode code : there is now only one class instead of three plus an interface", 
   "o Modified the DnNode class to allow branches to store an element (we need this for overlapping partitions and APs)", 
   "o Changed the api to be more consistent and more explicit", 
   "o Added extensive tests for the api", 
   "o Removed a test in the PartitionTreeTest class, as overlapping partition will be accepted in the partition tree", 
   "o Added code in the AdministrativePointInterceptor to create the list of APs for an entry"
