   "looks like we need another file, to differentiate between rules in the sandboxes for testing, and rules in core that have not made the quality thresholds -- rules/70_inactive.cf .  This is treated the same way as rules/70_sandbox.cf, but isn't used in the bbmass mass-checks.   Also: keep loadplugin files from core/sandbox in the appropriate output file, not in both or one alone."
