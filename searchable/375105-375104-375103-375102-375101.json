   "- Implemented encrypting a message using a DerivedKey (Signature coming up :-) )", 
   "- Added WSSecDKSignEncrypt to do the Encryption and Signing (Sometimes the same session key will have to be used to derive the encryption and signature key therefore thought of using a single builder to do both if and when required)", 
   "- Added a new processor to process derived keys : DerivedKeyTokenProcessor", 
   "- Imported (slightly refactored) a set of classes from secure conversation sandbox, which are required for key derivation and to access constants", 
   "- Added a test case - wssec.TestWSSecurityNewDK", 
   "- Fixed a test compile error by adding two empty methods to WSS4JPolicyToken"
