   "Made the various receive variants check that the server queue is empty before returning null. Also modified AMQQueueBrowser to use receiveNoWait() when browsing queues using 0-10. These changes uncovered numerous second order bugs, mostly in failover. These are also fixed. This fixes QPID-1642 and QPID-1643."
