   "Throw exception if for a connected graph no edge is found that connects to the previous nodes during optimization process. This is a situation which should never happen, since unless all nodes are visited, there is always an edge which connects to the rest of the connected graph. Since this is a fatal situation, instead to send a debug logging message, the application now throws an exception."
