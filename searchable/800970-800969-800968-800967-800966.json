   "Reverted previous change to DesktopApplicationContext - it introduced a bug in JNLP deployment when the main() method is run on the event dispatch thread, in which case the WINDOW_OPENED event listener was getting notified immediately when we opened the window, but we hadn't set the application yet, so the application was never called to start-up.  In standard command-line deployment, the issue existed as a rare race condition."
