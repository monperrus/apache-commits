   "OPENEJB-777 OPENEJB-702.  Introduce NamedXAResource wrapping for DBCP datasources, and supply a TxRecovery parameter to turn this on and off for DBCP pools and for mdbs.  Also introduce a factory bean to create the transaction manager together with XidFactory and HOWLLog so standalone openejb has transaction recovery possibilities.  These are all turned off in embedded as the tests do not shut down the log sufficiently for it to be restarted in the same vm.  The DBCP pool code is hacky but appears to work."
