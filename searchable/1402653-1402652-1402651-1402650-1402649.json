   "Implementing AMQ-4137 : Create a store import/export command line tool to covert between store types", 
   "Usage is a simple as \"bin/activemq export --file=archive.tgz\".  All data is stored in the tgz in the format defined by the Apollo store export/import utilities.  Only export implemented at this time.  I have verified that Apollo can import queues exported from ActiveMQ.  Durable subs probably need a little more work."
