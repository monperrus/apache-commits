   "1. Updated the codegenerator to support multiple services/ports/bindings and porttypes", 
   "I. Added two new parameters to the codegen/CodeGenConfiguration.java", 
   "II. Updated the MultiLanguageClientEmitter.java to select the service/port first and then select the binding and porttype from that. This allows the codegenerator to cater for multiple porttypes. By default if the service/port is not specified, then the first one is picked.", 
   "III .Moved the codegenconfig loading code to a new class and updated it to handle long parameters (long command line parameters)", 
   "2. Fixed a few bugs in the SchemaCompiler and Codegenerator", 
   "3. Removed the AxisBindingBuilder from the extensions list"
