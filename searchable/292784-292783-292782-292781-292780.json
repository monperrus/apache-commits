   "o Changed the profile activation in it0075 to use a system property which is not always present", 
   "o Added projecthelp:active-profiles, package, and clean:clean to the goals list, in case it was only happening with the clean plugin", 
   "o Fixed the projecthelp mojos to be aggregators where appropriate", 
   "o Changed the ordering of modules in the profile injector (used to be that profile modules were prepended; now, they're appended)", 
   "NOTE: I still cannot reproduce the described behavior. Dan: Am I missing something WRT the test setup? I changed the activation trigger to be non-inherent, and I'm not using a boolean string to trigger the profile. What am I doing wrong??"
