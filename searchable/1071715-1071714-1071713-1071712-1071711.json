   "when processing classes with the Jsr303MetaBeanFactory, ensure that a new MetaProperty is only retained when some processing took place.  This prevents overlarge amounts of metadata being stored as a result of field-reading in particular; specifically the use of AOP weaving can add arbitrarily numerous numbers of fields to a class which realistically need no validation.  ValidationContextTraversal has been modified to handle validations requested specifically for non-constrained, but valid, properties."
