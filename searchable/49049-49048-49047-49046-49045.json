   "Changing interface to some methods to return correctly typed objects which are available in a Map using the property of the field as the key.  This Map can be accessed from the ValidatorForm.  The change should be transparent through the framework, but any direct method calls to these methods will need to be changed.  The change in the interface is to reduce duplication for Struts 1.1."
