   "- added new DDLGeneratorMojo maven plugin, generating ddl using ddlutils instead of with torque", 
   "- created a new jetspeed-portal-resources project aggregating all portal resources (including the portal webapp and the generated ddl, see Mojo above) in one big resources jar", 
   "this is kinda like the maven-1 plugin, but without any code or logic, just a plain resources jar", 
   "- running mvn package (or install) from the root folder will already produce a few artifacts, including the DDLGeneratorMojo and the jetspeed-portal-resources"
