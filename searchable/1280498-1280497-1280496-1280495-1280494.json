   "Fixing an issue where the scrollbars don't disappear after a throw when using itemRendererFunction.", 
   "This originally broke in SVN 17804 with the fix for SDK-27734. The reason is because instead of doing scroller.dispatchEvent(event) we now do mouseDownedDisplayObject.dispatchEvent(event) and have the event bubble. Unfortunately, with itemRendererFunction, sometimes mouseDownedDisplayObject is no longer on screen (just using itemRenderers don't have this issue because they stay on the display list and get re-used).", 
   "The absolute fix for this is to tell people if they must know when the END occurs, they should listen directly on the mouseDownedDisplayObject. Or, we could grab the display list at mouse down time, keep track of it, and manually dispatch events to every object in the display list hierarchy at mouse down time. Unfortunately, that seems a little heavy-handed.", 
   "So to fix this, we will dispatch a bubbling event to the mouseDownedDisplayObject, as we are doing today, and if that display object is not on the stage and is not a child of scroller, we will also dispatch the same bubbling event on the Scroller. It is not a perfect solution as the DataGroup inside could technically be listening for this event as well, but it seems like a good enough approximation to not worry about it for now. As mentioned before, if someone absolutely needs to know when the event is over, instead of relying on the bubbling event, they should attach a listener directly to the mouseDownedDisplayObject.",
