   "Internationalization cleanup for cases where addError and addMessage were being used with directly concatenated strings.  Added properties for strings where required, and removed some duplicated properties.  Fixed up UIAction.cleanText to handle %{} expressions as well.  [Note: my IDE also indicates several unreferenced ApplicationResources property keys, but I have not cleaned them up in this revision.]"
