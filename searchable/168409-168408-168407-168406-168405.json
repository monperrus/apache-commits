   "Added simple webapp sample that demonstrates Spring-Controls integration.  External configuration of Controls is done using Spring bean definition files, and either Controls or Spring factory methods can be used to instantiate them.", 
   "Made the @BaseProperties(controlImplementation) property of Controls be a settable property, meaning it is possible to programmatically set the implementation class bound to a Control.  This is used by Spring sample to support impl configuration as part of the bean definition.  Modified test beaninfo data files to reflect the presence of this new property setter."
