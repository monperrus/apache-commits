   "JCR-1979: Deadlock on concurrent read & transactional write operations", 
   "Moved the virtual provider accesses outside the workspace read lock. This avoids the deadlock with a transactional write.", 
   "This change in lock scope does not endanger consistency, as all the modifiable virtual providers already have their own internal locking (as evidenced by the deadlock scenario!). In fact a global virtual provider like the version store *must* have it's own locking mechanism as it can be concurrently accessed from multiple workspaces."
