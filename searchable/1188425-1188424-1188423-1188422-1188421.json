   "Fix why online schema change didn't preserve locality",

   "Summary:", 
   "rH17734 (Port online schema changes to 89) has some problem to preserve", 
   "locality.", 
   "There are 2 code path to process RegionClose event, which needs to preserve", 
   "locality.", 
   "path #1: If the master issues a close region operation, the region server will", 
   "close that region and update the zk. The master watches the zk event and handle", 
   "the region close event properly.", 
   "path #2:  For other reasons ( e.g RS cannot open region), the region server", 
   "wants to close this region. The region server will send the msg MSG_REPORT_CLOSE", 
   "to master. The master will update the region status as closed for this region.", 
   "rH17734 only updates the code path #2 for preserving locality after restart.", 
   "But for online schema changes, it actually go through the code path #1.", 
   "That's why we lost the locality after online schema change.", 
   "The solution is to preserve the locality in the common code path for path #1", 
   "and path #2",
