   "Added loading of features based on the content of a feature.properties file at server startup. This looks up features based on IRI and classname and adds them to the DB. Tests are included, as is the default feature.properties file. This removes the necessity for setting up features directly in SQL and so the relevant line has been removed from each of the DB setup scripts. This changeset implements WOOKIE-99."
