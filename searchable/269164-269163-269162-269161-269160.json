   "Changed interface so that instead of returning other components it hides it behind an abstraction. ie Instead of returning a ProjectBuilder it provides interface to ProjectBuilder. Same with ProjectManager.", 
   "This allows interface/implementation to be changed without effecting the \"frontend interface\" and vastly simplifies writing frontends.", 
   "Also a new ProjectManager is create for each request. Also input parameters are provided for future extention (ie parameters to builder and the builder \"type\");"
