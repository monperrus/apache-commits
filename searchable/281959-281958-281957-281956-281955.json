   "The only change in core is adding the property to Request/Response.",

   "modules to control the byte<->char and fix the wrong code", 
   "that assumes ascii ( that also means javax.servlet, but we", 
   "can override the methods ).", 
   "- performance - enable faster character encoders", 
   "- protocol adapters - all existing adapters implement only", 
   "the read/write operations.",

   "instead of BufferedServletInput/Output stream.", 
   "- the code in buffer is the same as in BufferedOutputStream.", 
   "BufferedInputStream was just a stub, added the buffering", 
   "( a bit better, not complete yet )",

   "instead of extending request/response). The old model still works,", 
   "but I think we should deprecate it soon.", 
   "- Ajp13ConnectorResponse: no longer extend BufferedOS, just", 
   "override write. It's a first step in moving to ByteBuffer.", 
   "- added various utils to BuffTool - scan a byte[] directly.", 
   "- reorganized the http code to use buffers - see HttpAdapter", 
   "- small change in PoolTcpConnectionHandler - replaced", 
   "the Vector with a SimplePool ( lighter ) and also added the", 
   "option to not use a pool, just per thread data ( less sync in", 
   "critical path )", 
   "- moved \"commited\" from BufferedServletOS to Response, where", 
   "it should be  (since BSOS is just a facade).", 
   "- added missing setPort method in request", 
   "- small fixes in facades - if request processing fails, default", 
   "context's facade will be used. This will be important after we", 
   "fix the security and implement webapp isolation."
