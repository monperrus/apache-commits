   "Finished round trip test for fulfillment, return and notice of refurbishment complete for serialized inventory; this included a number of bug fixes, and fleshing out functionality in receiveInventoryProduct to handle InventoryItem updates, and of course changes to use that instead of just updating the InventoryItem and leaving out the ShipmentReceipt, ReturnItem, etc changes necessary; note that to see if return is totally received now looks at ShipmentReceipt records instead of InventoryItemDetail so it will work with serialized and non-serialized inventory"
