   "Fixed an issue in the writeStartElement related code generated by ADB: XMLStreamWriter#writeStartElement(String) creates an element in the default namespace, and not an element with an empty namespace URI, as the code incorrectly assumed. Fixed that, taking into account that the empty namespace URI must be mapped to the empty prefix, i.e. it must be the default namespace. This should fix AXIS2-4374."
