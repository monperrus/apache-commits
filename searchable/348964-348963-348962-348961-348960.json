   "1.We have a problem in the client side as all the clients are sharing the same config context, irrepective of the client home (repository in the client side) given. One place this is being used is within the ListenerManager (it has a *static* config context). The solution is to pass the configuration context into the ListenerManager and have it use that as a key to start specific listeners for specific transports. We have changed the code to do this.", 
   "2.Re-factored the assumeServiceContext stuff from Call and MessageSender to MEPClient and cleaned up related artifacts to make the ListenerManager stuff work."
