   "Added three new service interfaces for activity, person and app data that better fit the restful model. They use two new objects RestfulCollection (that is just like ApiCollection but with its fields matching the new restful format) and DataCollection (which matches the return format for data).", 
   "Updated the Basic*Services to implement both these new interfaces and the old ones. The abdera code should switch to using these new apis to clean up the handlers.", 
   "(sorry for the confusing service names - when we get around to deprecating the old format things will be better...)"
