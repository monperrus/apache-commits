   "continuum-758 converted continuum-core over to use the plexus-maven-plugin where it can in generation of the components.xml and then a merge with the components can can't be totally configured that way.  This tore a lot of the meat out of the existing components.xml and should make working with the settings we need to manage with it a lot easier.  I commented where the components that are in continuum-core that couldn't be configured with the plugin in the components.xml file that we are merging in."
