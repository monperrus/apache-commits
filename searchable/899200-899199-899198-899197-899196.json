   "Fix for DIRSTUDIO-616 (Entry Editor Manager does not ensure that the entry's attributes are initialized (loaded) before testing and opening editors).", 
   "New fix as the previous one introduced a regression (the opening of the editor was synchronous with the load of attributes of the entry in the UI thread which could lead to a non responding UI in case the load of attributes takes a while).", 
   "This fix uses an asynchronous job, separate from the UI thread which gives the control back to the UI as soon as the job is scheduled."
