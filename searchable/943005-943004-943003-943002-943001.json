   "SHIRO-95 - created test case to verify explicitly set Cache and CacheManager instances are not overwritten by defaults.  Both AuthorizingRealm and CachingSessionDAO were setting their respective caches to null when a CacheManager instance was set - this behavior has been removed as it is unexpected by end-users.  Also made Cache and CacheManager interfaces and implementations generics-capable.  IniSecurityManagerFactoryTest#testCacheManagerConfigOrderOfOperations test method was added to verify functionality."
