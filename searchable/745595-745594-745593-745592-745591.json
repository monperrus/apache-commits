   "Attempt to address DBCP-272.", 
   "We can never truely fix this since the way drivers are expected to register with the DriverManager is asking for a deadlock to occur in multi-thread environments - as per DBCP-272. What we can do is attempt to prevent this in environments where only DBCP is used. This patch calls DriverManager.getDrivers() to force initialisation before we ever do anything that might use Class.forName() to load (and register) a JDBC driver."
