   "Let the message receivers and deployers use the ServiceObjectSupplier interface properly.", 
   "Detailed explanation:", 
   "Prior to r439555 service object suppliers were actually defined by a static method with a given signature defined on an arbitrary class. r439555 introduced the ServiceObjectSupplier interface, but didn't change the code that invokes the supplier, which continues to use reflection. However, if the specified class implements the ServiceObjectSupplier, then there is no need to use reflection. The code has been changed to call the supplier through the ServiceObjectSupplier interface. It still supports the old way of defining the supplier, but issues a warning inviting the user to provide a proper ServiceObjectSupplier implementation (since that is considered as the recommended approach)."
