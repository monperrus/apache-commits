   "Group.jsp, DeleteGroup.jsp, EditGroup.jsp and content JSPs refactored to use Stripes tags. GroupTab.jsp eliminated from Preferences screen. We will re-do this, later. Separated Login/create profile/lost password into separate JSPs (was causing havoc with form submits). Stripes-related labels, field names and validation errors moved to CoreResources i18n files, and removed from templates/default. Message keys were renamed to match Stripes field names where practical."
