   "testComprehensiveTypes uses StringBuffer instead of simple concatenation.", 
   "Sun's JDK 1.4.2 (both _01 and _02) can't compile WSDLTest.java with a message that the result of the concatenation is too long for a String constant.", 
   "(According to Dr. Kim, one of my colleagues and specialized in JVM, told me a String constant in a class binary has the limit of 64k.)", 
   "I also think that dealing with (extremely) long String instances, it's better to use a StringBuffer usually for better performance and stability."
