   "* I've added an incubating disclaimer to the README file.", 
   "* I've removed the \"temp\" and \"tmp\" folders from the src distribution.", 
   "* That DynamicImport is indeed unnecessary; I've removed it.", 
   "* I've fixed the Bundle-Description and Bundle-DocURL properties of the manifest.", 
   "* I've modified the pom.xml to use custom assembly descriptors that I've checked in under src/assemble.  I've used them to a) remove the .bz2-compressed files. b) add the KEYS file to the bin distribution. c) hopefully added the javadocs to the binary distribution (I'm not sure this will work yet)."
