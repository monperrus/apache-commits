   "On shutdown the cache will only  send memory items to disk auxiliries and not other types on shutdown.  It no longer does this via an iterator, it does it via the freeMemoryElements method on the memory cache itself.  This has the advantage of pushing the items to disk via the overflow chanel.  The overflow chanel has the disk update pattern logic.  If the cache is running in disk mode SWAP, then the items in memory will go to disk, otherwise they will not.  This makes disk shutdown faster.", 
   "I added unit tests for the composite cache manager shutdown that verify the behavior.", 
   "Formatted several other classes."
