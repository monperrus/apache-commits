   "Fix our distribution algorithm for distributing space among flexible children. Before, we would remove any unused space if the sum of the percentages was less than 100. However, this didn't take into account min and max sizes. Now, we take into account the min and max sizes while also recalculating the unused space for each iteration. This space is also added to the final excess space that's returned.",

   "Added better baseline support for ConstraintLayout. ConstraintRow's now have a baseline property. It can either be a number or of the form \"maxAscent:x\". In the first case, it will position elements at that y-pixel value in the row based on their baseline position.  Otherwise, it first aligns elements to the maximum baseline position of the elements in the row, and then, positions elements based on the pixel value provided. This support allows elements with different baselinePositions to be aligned more easily.",
