   "The last index (used on the last button) is not calculated correctly in ftl or the renderer classes. It currently users floor which works only for list sizes that are not multiples of the view size. When you have a list size which is a multiple of the view size, it does not subtract 1 for zero based index and therefore the last button goes to the last page + 1",
