   "Fixes TAPESTRY-1418.", 
   "The component target -> listeners were being mapped with the basic IComponent.getId() value, which isn't globally unique. Refactored the logic for resolving Form enclosures / specified component targets to happen in the PageLoader with a component tree visitor that validates all components specified in @EventListener annotations are actually resolvable. (vs quietly failing without telling anyone). Changed mappings to use IComponent.getIdPath() .", 
   "Still need to move or cache the logic happening in ComponentEventConnectionWorker somehow as it's currently costing a few ms during render."
