   "Bug fix: fixed an issue with WikiContext that caused ACLs and policy settings to be ignored when accessing the default front page. This bug was introduced during the AAA mega-patch in July (2.4.25). Note: we still have an unrelated bug with ACLs not being applied the *first time* pages are loaded."
