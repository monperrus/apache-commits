   "- Ensured that direct calls to the HttpServletRequest will honor 'noSessionCreation' filter settings as well (i.e. httpServletRequest.getSession() or httpServletRequest.getSession(true)).", 
   "- Added noSessionCreation checks to WebUtils, but with big warnings (and prefixing with an underscore) to indicate it is not intended to be used by Shiro end users.", 
   "- Changed NoSessionCreationFilter alias in the DefaultFilter enum to be 'noSessionCreation' instead of 'noSession'.  It is more verbose but more accurate - it doesn't disable all session usage, just creating them (i.e. another part of the app may create a session that can still be used).", 
   "- Updated the gmaven plugin and actually enabled it for Maven builds (Groovy-based test cases were not being run from the command line - only in the IDE.  Now they run via command line builds as expected)."
