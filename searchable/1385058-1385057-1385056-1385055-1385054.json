   "[jira] [HBASE-6728] [89-fb] bound responseQueue to prevent OOM", 
   "Author: michalgr", 
   "Summary:", 
   "In HBaseServer, if connection is not able to send responses as fast as they are produced, responses are queued in per connection queue. The queue is unbounded and this can cause OOM.", 
   "This patch introduces size-based boundary, a configurable limit on how much memory can be occupied by responses in all responsequeues. If this limit is exceeded handler threads have to wait to submit a response.", 
   "Test Plan: Unit tests + I will try to observe impact on latency in performance test i used to compare different HBase changes.",
