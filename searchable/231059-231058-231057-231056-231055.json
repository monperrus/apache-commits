   "Resolving: MNG-592 (again)", 
   "o Modified the PluginMappingDeployMojo in maven-plugin-plugin to always deploy the plugins.xml regardless. This may be a bit heavy, but it avoids the snag with the plugins.xml being detected in the local repository after the install phase runs...plugin mappings weren't making it to the repository during deploy.", 
   "o Added a new series of IT: it2xxx which will be tests that require more than a single maven invocation, and will be run via shell script, at least for now. This one builds and deploys a plugin, then attempts to use the plugin by referencing the prefix mapping in the (non-central) remote repository."
