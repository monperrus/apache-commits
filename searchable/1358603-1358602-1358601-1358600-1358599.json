   "Fix FullCycleDBTest (https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53519)", 
   "- VectorAppender was in both log4j and log4j.receivers, probably a side effect of the move.  Removed VectorAppender from log4j.receivers and fixed drivermanager xml configuration files", 
   "- Test was also not passing because log4j logging events from DBReceiverJob were being received by Vectorappender and threw off the count - removed the unnecessary logging", 
   "- Also fixed an issue with the conversion pattern used by read-with-drivermanager1.xml - to use %relative etc you have to specify an EnhancedPatternLayout instead of the standard PatternLayout"
