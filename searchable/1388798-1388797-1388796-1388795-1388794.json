   "[jira] [HBASE-6619] [89-fb] Do no unregister and re-register interest ops in RPC", 
   "Author: michalgr", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Improvements in how we are dealing with incoming requests. Right now we are using deserialization pool. Every tame we get read event on a selector in listener, we deregister read operation and pass descriptor to deserialization pool. Then some thread (one of #CPUs + 1) reads some bytes, then registers read interest again and wake ups listener.", 
   "My changes introduce pool of Reader threads. Those threads have their own selectors and they do not have to register/deregister anything all the time.", 
   "This patch also delays parsing of incoming request. RawCalls are queued, and then parsed in Handler thread that gets it.",
