   "Enhancement: To increase security, MailUtil gains the ability to use container-managed JNDI JavaMail session factories, in addition to the standalone factory configured via jspwiki.properties. JNDI is now the preferred method of obtaining mail sessions, and will always be attempted first before falling back to the stand-alone method. See the JavaDocs for MailUtil. All of MailUtil's internal code, test properties and JavaDocs were also totally refactored. A sample JNDI block for JavaMail was added to web.xml; it is commented out by default."
