   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CTAKES-81", 
   "- Delete cTAKESCVDGUI.java and cTAKESCPEGUI.java; they look like a copy and paste of org.apache.uima.tools.cvd.CVD, org.apache.uima.tools.cpm.CpmFrame.  Just launch the UIMA classes; I couldn't see a need to have our own copies; if we really need to customize it, I would suggest extended UIMA and override any special functionality.  Otherwise, we'll end up maintaining these ourselves which is not ideal.", 
   "- Add profiles the pom.xml to allow launch CVD, CPE from mvn using Maven to dynamically resolve all of the required dependencies.  (We won't have to maintain yet another set of scripts that contain dependencies or require some uber-jar.)", 
   "- Update the existing runctakesCPE.sh, etc to use \"mvn exec:exec -PrunCPE\" instead."
