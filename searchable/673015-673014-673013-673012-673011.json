   "Removed hack fix for getting a count of results when there is a GROUP BY in the select; now lets the database do the count instead of iterating through every single result in order to get the count, so is WAY more efficient; note that this also uses the COUNT(1) instead of COUNT(*) approach for better performance, ie getting the same result but asking the database to do less"
