   "HADOOP-2247.  Fine-tune the strategies for killing mappers and reducers due to failures while fetching map-outputs. Now the map-completion times and number of currently running reduces are taken into account by the  JobTracker before  killing the mappers, while the progress made by the reducer and the number of fetch-failures vis-a-vis total number of fetch-attempts are taken into account before teh reducer kills itself.
