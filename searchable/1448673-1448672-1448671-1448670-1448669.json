   "STANBOL-951: The EntityLinking keeps now track of sub-sentence start/end tokens when processing upper case words. In addition upper case tokens are now only increased from none to matching and from matching to linking, but not from none to linking; Minor: added a default languages configuration to the TextProcessingConfig. Currently this has no effect as the EntityhubLinkingEngine overrides this with its own default, but this will ensure that other Engine implementations do start with a reasonable default"
