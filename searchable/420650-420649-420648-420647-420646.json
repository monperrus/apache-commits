   "Fix for MUSE-31 - modified NotificationProducer.publish() so that users can publish a notification",

   "need to make the WSRP change notifications manually (such as in cases where the changes are happening", 
   "outside the Muse application and are reported through some other product API). They can now do this", 
   "without having to write DOM manipulation code - just create an RPCE and pass it to publish(). The", 
   "ChangeNotificationListener was updated to use this class."
