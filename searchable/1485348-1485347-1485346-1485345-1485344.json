   "Fixed problem in xCAT.pm::load where it would incorrectly detect that an image load was complete shortly after beginning if nodestat returns ping or sshd after it previously returned install.", 
   "Added _get_install_status subroutine which uses a socket to connect directly to the node when it is being installed in order to retrieve the installation status. If the installer image is configured with a working SSH key nodestat will return 'sshd' instead of the detailed status."
