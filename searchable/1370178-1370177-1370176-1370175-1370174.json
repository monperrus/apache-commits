   "* Public keys are now of type OWLOntologyID, String is deprecated and so are related methods (though they will still be around for a progressive phase-out) (STANBOL-305)", 
   "* Added unit tests for ontology reconciliation, incl. anonymous and versioned ontologies (STANBOL-426, STANBOL-524)", 
   "* Added unifying type OriginOrInputSource in order to avoid excessive method overloads. I want this to be VERY temporary, and go back to using just OntologyInputSource once I allow input source that skip creating ontology objects (what origins are now).", 
   "* Delegated more methods to the OntologyNetworkMultiplexer (XXX this is very likely going to become an OSGi component).", 
   "* First stub of stored ontology HTML page with only metalevel information instead of the Manchester Syntax.", 
   "* Fixed a bug that caused scopes to still use the old namespaces when exporting core space imports (STANBOL-681)"
