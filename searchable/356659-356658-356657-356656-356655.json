   "build/mkrules now compiles 'good enough' rules to rules/72_active.cf, instead of copying all core rules into rules.  it also picks rules from sandboxes as part of this.  Not-promotable rules are left in rules/70_sandbox.cf.  It also follows meta dependencies correctly to ensure that each rule is in a consistent state even without the 72_sandbox.cf file."
