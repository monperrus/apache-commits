   "Async support for Axis. See test/client/TestAsyncCall.java for current usage. Since James's IME code has stalled (See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=axis-dev&m=105233711525903&w=2) there has been zero activity in this area. Hopefully the Sonic folks (prev email about sync was http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=axis-dev&m=103903901501446&w=2) will help refine the code and hook it upto James' IME when they get a chance."
