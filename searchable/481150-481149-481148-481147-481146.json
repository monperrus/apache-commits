   "GERONIMO-2537 Merge from branches/1.2 onto trunk. I have not reviewed trunk license info. So, it's possible that there are already some deltas which should be reflected in license/notice files. This change updates the general LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files. Note that I've expanded the notice/license files in the root of a source distribution. Also added required copyright to NOTICE.txt files. Note that minimal distributions have an overly broad license/notice files. Also, we have multiple copies of the same general license/notice files. Would be good to reduce these."
