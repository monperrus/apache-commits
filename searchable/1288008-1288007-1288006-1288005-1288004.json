   "Flex now requires CSS Style declarations to declare @namespace rules and disambiguate between halo and spark components using CSS 3 namespace prefixes on type selectors. At compile time, this namespace information will be used to map type names to qualified ActionScript class names. At runtime, type selectors are matched on qualified ActionScript class name (for example mx.controls.Button rather than just Button). Flex 3 applications must be compiled with -compatibility-version=3.0.0 to get unqualified CSS type selector behavior.", 
   "QE: Yes, this build may help in updating test cases to use the new namespaces and class names.",

   "2.  widthInChars changed to be width in ems (size of \"M\" in default font) even though the property hasn't been renamed yet. The default was changed from 20 to 15 for TextView, FxTextInput and FxTextArea.", 
   "3.  The heightInLines calculation was improved so it is much closer to what it would be if you actually measured the text.",
