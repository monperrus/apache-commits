   "Optimized processing of JMS BytesMessages with content type application/octet-stream by allowing the transport to pass a DataSource object instead of an InputStream to the message builder (BinaryBuilder in this case). The corresponding method is defined by a new optional interface DataSourceMessageBuilder. When this method is used, the message builder can process the message without creating a copy of the data."
