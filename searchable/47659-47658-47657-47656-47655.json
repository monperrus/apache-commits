   "Introduce generalized initializers for Java-based declarative control clients.  These initializers provide a simple, uniform mechanism for any Java class to be a declarative control client, supporting @Control and @EventMethod annotations.  Apt-driven compilation of a Java class that has @Control annotations will result in an initializer class that encapsulates all the work necessary to wire up the contained controls.  See org.apache.beehive.controls.test.java.composition.DeclarativeTest for an example of this.", 
   "The controls runtime itself now uses this mechanism to handle nested controls.", 
   "See org.apache.beehive.controls.runtime.bean.ControlBean for how this works."
