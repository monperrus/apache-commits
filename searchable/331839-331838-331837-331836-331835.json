   "PR: MNG-1320", 
   "o Modified private resolveAlways(..) method to throw TransferFailedException, after blacklisting the repository.", 
   "o Added handling for the new TransferFailedException as it's thrown from resolveAlways(..). In two cases, where it's not essential that the metadata be non-empty, this exception is ignored. I'm anticipating this will change for 2.1, but for now it's just marked TODO. In the final case (the one that prompted this MNG), the exception is used to inhibit writing of the empty metadata to the local repository when the transfer fails. NOTE: The metadata is still handled the same as before when the system encounters ResourceDoesNotExistException, to prevent re-checking the remote repo on every build."
