   "Getting further along with customizing from PSML Browser. It seems that we can no longer customize WML (or other media types). The group sample PSML is either invalid or the customizer can't handle it.",

I just don't have the cycles to clean this thing up properly right now :(  I'd like to remove AutoProfile and all the hard-coded WML code, but Im having trouble understanding what's going on with all the hard-coding in there. Afraid Im going to have to put this off and revisit it in August.",
