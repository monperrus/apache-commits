   "Fixed responses to stored procedure requests which failed with exceptions.  What", 
   "was happening is that a response was not returning an OID and this was causing", 
   "the CommunicationExcpetion with the JNDI LDAP provider.  Now the request that", 
   "is produced by the TwixTransformer is an instance of StoredProcedureRequest and", 
   "it returns a StoredProcedureResponse when we invoke getResultResponse() on it.", 
   "The result response object now is an instdance of StoredProcedureResponse as", 
   "opposed to a normal ExtendedResponseImpl instance.  This allows us to infer the", 
   "OID and add that automatically."
