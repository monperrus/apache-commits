   "Finish support for env.properties so that scripts and ant tasks such as <mxmlc> work correctly if properties are being used.  Note change of precedence - env.properties has precedence over environment variables.  The compiler will replace {playerglobalHome}/{airHome} tag in the configuration file with env.PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME/env.AIR_HOME property if defined, else PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME/AIR_HOME environment variable if defined, else it leaves the token unaltered. Leaving the unexpanded token rather than replacing it with a space makes it easier to diagnose the error since the bad path is show in the \"unable to open file\" error.",
