   "When a SecurityManager is used, add a javax.security.auth.Subject object to the current java.security.AccessControlContext. This change allows a custom SecurityManager to grant/denied permission based on the Subject/Principal. This change does not affect either Tomcat used with no SecurityManager or Tomcat used with the default security manager. It will allow JSR 115 Java Authorization Contract for Container implementation to use Tomcat code as it is. Authorization decisions can now be implemented by creating an instance of a Realm."
