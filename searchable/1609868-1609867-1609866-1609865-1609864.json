   "Make the factory attribute private to force subclasses to use the getOMFactory() method. This fixes a problem reported by Detelin Yordanov, where a null value is copied to a newly created node if the factory attribute has not been initialized yet (which is possible when the SOAP version is autodetected: in this case the factory is set only when the SOAP envelope has been reached)."
