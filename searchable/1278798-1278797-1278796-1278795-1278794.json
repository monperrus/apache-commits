   "- Added functionality to keep the anchor button in the down state when the dropDown is open.", 
   "- Changed SkinnableDataContainer's dataGroup skin part from required to optional. Added some null check protection to List, and ListBase. Changed the DropDownListSkin to only include the dropDown in the open state.", 
   "Bug Fixes:", 
   "SDK-20534 - DropDownList does not gray out text when disabled", 
   "Updated the skin to set the alpha in the disabled state", 
   "SDK-20532 - When using scroll bar on the dropDown of a DropDownList the dropDown closes", 
   "Added dropDown skinPart that defines the area that doesn't automatically close DropDownList on a mouseDown", 
   "SDK-19868 - Gumbo DropDownList should support symbolColor style", 
   "Changed the down arrow in the DropDownListButtonSkin to use a radialGradient fill instead of a DropShadowFilter. Also, the PopUp component now passes its styles along to its content.", 
   "SDK-19572 - DropDownList popup doesnt close or move when resizing browser window", 
   "Added a systemManager resize handler that closes the dropDown", 
   "SDK-20535 - DropDownList text styles are not passed on to dropDown and no dropDown styles exist", 
   "The PopUp component now passes its styles along to its content.", 
   "SDK-20555 - Spark DropDownList should size itself a bit better so partial rows arent displayed if possible", 
   "Changed the default size of the dropDown from 140 to 134. This should handle this issue if the DropDownList is using the default item renderer",
