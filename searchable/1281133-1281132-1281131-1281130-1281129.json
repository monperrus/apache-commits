   "SDK-24623 (Video doesn't stop when layer containing it is made non visibile and pauseWhenHidden=true): We now add a \"layerPropertyChange\" events to designLayers, if they exist.  We also check for designLayer.effectiveVisibility.", 
   "SDK-24619 (when source is set to null, duration is not set back to 0 and there is no durationChange event): The binding issue was actually previously fixed.  This is just updating the ASDoc so people don't expect such events when the source gets set to null.  An OSMF bug has been filed for them to dispatch these events when the element gets set to null (or in the short-term, update their ASDocs in a similar fashion).", 
   "SDK-24647 (Should be a way to disable Spark VideoPlayer full-screen hide controls delay): When the fullScreenHideControlsDelay is set to Infinity, we will now never hide the player controls in fullScreen mode.", 
   "SDK-24626 (RTE when trying to set Spark VideoPlayer scaleMode via data binding): Added more logic to deal with what happens if someone sends in a bad or null scaleMode.", 
   "SDK-24586 ([GUMBO_PRIORITY] scaleMode=\"none\" and scaleMode=\"zoom\" on VideoDisplay doesn't clip video to bounds): The underlying OSMF bug wasn't fixed, but they gave me a new approach to use RegionGateway for the viewing area rather than MediaPlayerSprite.",

   "When the source is null, the bindings on some of the properties (specifically currentTime, duration, bytesLoaded, and bytesTotal) should fire.  In VideoPlayer, if you look at videoDisplay_mediaPlayerStateChangeHandler(), we are already doing the correct thing in there to make sure our VideoPlayer object looks correct.  However, if someone just binds to these values, they should also update.  To fix this, I added [Bindable(\"mediaPlayerStateChange\")] on these properties.", 
   "Also, I noticed when setting the source to null, our size doesn\u2019t invalidate.  So I cleaned up some logic around there.", 
   "Lastly, Flash Builder wants to make sure that resetting thumbnailSource or setting it to null is possible.  I cleaned up the logic to allow for the null case.",
