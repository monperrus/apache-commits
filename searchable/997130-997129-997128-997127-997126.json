   "[WAGON-60] wagon-webdav fails with commons-logging classloader issues", 
   "This was solved by excluding the version of commons-logging (1.0.4) that comes transitively from commons-httpclient 3.1, and instead adding a direct dependency on commons-logging 1.1.1. Version 1.1.1 of commons-logging is more tolerant with regards to class loader issues than version 1.0.4."
