   "Removed the requirement for configuration/ and packages/ sub-folders. Composites directly under TUSCANY_SCACPP_SYSTEM_ROOT (top level composites) get included in the SCA system composite (with the same effect as an SCA include), and components that they declare are instanciated in the SCA system. Other composites under that directory tree are available as implementations of components. This change also simplifies the ModelLoader by reusing the same code to load the top-level system composites and the other ones, and the ModelLoader is now able to load nested composites correctly. Finally, as an alternative to TUSCANY_SCACPP_SYSTEM_ROOT, you can now declare a list of directories to scan for top-level composites in TUSCANY_SCACPP_ROOT and a list of directories to scan for implementation composites in TUSCANY_SCACPP_PATH. I adjusted the samples and their build scripts to follow the new simplified folder structure."
