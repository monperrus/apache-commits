   "The new Command class is now fully integrated into WikiEngine.createContext() and the WikiContext constructors. Practically speaking, this means that the page names and redirect errors shown on pages will actually show something useful when non-pages are accessed (e.g., access denied for UserPreferences.jsp won't print the non-sensical \"you don't have access to 'Main'). WikiEngine delegates page-resolution responsibilities to CommandResolver. Minor changes to new Command/CommandResolver classes to make JSP page names \"friendlier\"."
