   "added the patch from Hadrian to demonstrate CAMEL-197 along with a fix - which turned out to have a fairly large impact. interceptors are now normal OutputTypes like anything else and they act as a block; so anything added to them will be intercepted. You can break the intercept block in the DSL using 'end()'. We can reuse this block mechanism for other kinds of block; like filter/otherwise etc"
