   "Add local axis manifests to handle split package between kernel and transport-http. Export package versions are a bit wonky still. These manifest a used during the distro build to create the bundle repo that's used when you load the project using the Eclipse PDE. They aren't used during runtime. Runtime uses the manifests in the node-launcher-equinox! Needs work to remove this confusion."
