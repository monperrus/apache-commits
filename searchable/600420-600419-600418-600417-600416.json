   "fix settings initialization issue, related to the changes made for IVY-639. Default settings were loaded when no there was no Ivy in context, which was actually happening pretty often in the ant tasks since the Ivy instance was only attached when calling an Ivy method. Now all IvyTasks push an IvyContext with the configured Ivy instance attached, and pop it at the end.", 
   "I've also reviewed the default message logger use, now MessageLoggerEngine actually use it as currently defined (and not as defined at logger engine init) at the time it needs it. This allow easier configuration of the default logger with the Message.setDefaultLogger() method, which actually propagates to all logger engines on which a default logger has not been specificied."
