   "Ldif partitions were updating data in ldif files by doing in place updates. This makes corrupt files more likely in case of a crash during these updates.", 
   "Both single file and multi file ldif partitions are changed to write to a shadow file and then do a move to the intended file. When they are doing a delete, they again do a mvoe. In most file systems, move is atomic, so this makes corrupt data after a crash less likely.", 
   "For single file ldif partition, write of data to file is done during sync() rather than during enableReWrite.", 
   "Tests are changed to use partition interface and operation execution manager rather than store interface."
