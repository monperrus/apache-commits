   "Redo the contribution modules merge started in r772861 but this time including svn history. As everyone seems happy with this approach now instead of doing it in a new module its just done directly in the existing contribution module. This is the start of what was described on the ML as'contribution (or core-contribution or contribution-runtime) for all the spi/infrastructure type of stuff', right now it has everything so its all in one place to make things obvious and the other  contribution-* modules can be be created by moving bits out of here."
