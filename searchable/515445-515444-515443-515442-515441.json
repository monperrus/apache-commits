   "[CXF-446] Applied Jarek's patch for creating service from implementation bean which does not implement the SEI",

   "Current CXF's code first approach is implemented by simple front end's ReflectionServiceFactoryBean.", 
   "It work for turning the POJO style Java code into a service model.", 
   "It does not consume the Jaxws annotation and take the response message target namespace as the operation namespace {http://cxf.apache.org/greeter_control}.And the  response message target namespace actually should be {http://cxf.apache.org/greeter_control/types}.", 
   "To fix this issue, we need to implement the creation of service model from class which is annotated with the Jaxws annotation without WSDL location."
