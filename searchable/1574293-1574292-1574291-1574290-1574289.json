   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4631 reasons that if authentication", 
   "is enabled and no ACL rule file is specified then interbroker links are", 
   "denied. The check for 'ACL rule file is loaded' is simply the existence of",

   "the formerly null rule set when no ACL file is specified. This solution has", 
   "too much complexity in several places and is too hard.", 
   "The fix implemented here is a boolean flag indicating if the ACL rule set", 
   "in force is specified by the user or not. Then the security check tests", 
   "that the acl exists (always true) and that the rule set is specified by the", 
   "user."
