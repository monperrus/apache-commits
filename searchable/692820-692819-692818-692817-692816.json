   "Moved hooks from extensiblity-equinox to node-launcher-equinox. Fixed logic that installs bundles in node-launcher-equinox, which now just installs bundles normally and installs all non-bundle JARs in a single 'library' bundle which exports all the packages that they contain. The startup sequence is now simpler and significantly faster."
