   "Added helper method parse(Reader) to Digester for completeness. So any Reader or InputStream can now be used as input of the XML source without the user having to explicitly use a SAX InputSource. This makes it a little easier to work with internal String buffers, e.g. using a StringReader() as the source of a piece of XML."
