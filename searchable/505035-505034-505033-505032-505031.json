Still, this is obviously not good.", 
   "If we could pass StyleContext to getStyleClassMap, then that would be good, but StyleContext is not in the public api. That's why we pass in RenderingContext.", 
   "The change I made was to go back to looking to see if the skin's renderKitId is portlet. We don't compress if portlet."
