   "o Added xml-based documentation of supported plugin parameter expressions, including info about how to affect them ('-o' for example), how to specify them (<distributionManagement><repository/> for example in ${project.distributionManagementArtifactRepository}), and what the expressions are actually used for. This can also serve as a basis for creating documentation for plugin parameter expressions on the website.",
