   "1. Halfway through implementing unwrapping support",

   "II. Added the extension to the codegen-config.properties file", 
   "2. Refactored the codegen-config.properties (with line breaks) for easy reading.(and added the above extension)", 
   "3. Modified the databinding extensions to pick the existing type mapper before creating a new one. This allows one to have a pre populated type map", 
   "4. Removed the static default class name (OMElement) and made it a field. This allows the data binding frameworks to override the default as appropriate. However the override was only added to XMLbeans extension.", 
   "5. Set the log levels of the pretty printers to debug. It is painful to see the class not found exception in info level!", 
   "6. Added a sanity check to the TypeMapperExtension.java to test the compatibility of databinding frameworks"
