   "ADFFACES-232 Disabling PPR when running from a portlet. This patch will change the output mode on the RequestContext to portlet when running in a portlet environment. This output mode is used for determining renderkit capabilities which successfully disables multi-window support and ppr capabilities. In the future this could be modified as the capabilities of the Portlet container increase.", 
   "Took out the isPortlet from CoreRenderKit.java, since similar code is there in this patch."

   "Introduce a means to get the most recent OperationContext from the ServiceClient.  This works by optionally storing the OperationContext in the ServiceContext - this caching is controlled by a boolean property on ServiceContext.java.  If the property is set, each time an OperationContext gets created by an OperationClient, it will be stored away.  You can access it later with ServiceClient.getLastOperationContext().",
