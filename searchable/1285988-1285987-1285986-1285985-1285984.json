   "Fixed bug with shader transition effects running on loaded modules/applications.", 
   "The problem was in how we were capturing the bitmap snapshot of the object. We would get the object's location relative to its parent's systemManager, but would then combine that location with the concatenatedMatrix of the object (which is collected all the way to the root window). This caused a problem with loaded SWFs where its systemManager was not at (0,0) relative to the stage. The fix was to use the sandboxRoot of that systemManager, which is relative to the overall stage.",
