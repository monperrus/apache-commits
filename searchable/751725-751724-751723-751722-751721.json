   "QPID-949 : Removed the deleteOnExit calls on all flowed entries, as this will increase our memory usage. Instead add a close method on the BackingStore that is called when the queue closes and clean up the backing then. Also moved the QueueHousekeeping thread stop to before we do any queue closing in the VHost. This will ensure that we are not causing any operations that might inadvertadly load a message, and so prevent the backing file from being deleted. This should of course now not occur as all getMessage() calls have been removed."
