   "Partial fix for TRINIDAD-1086", 
   "This is a fix for the RowKeySet having a possibility of not having a collection model reference. There is still a problem with the demo", 
   "with the RI. For some reason the binding expression for the componentDemos page for the componentTreeBean fails when the setter method is called (the bean never gets called). As a result, the nodes stay collapsed until the page is refreshed (either by refresh or post-back). This works fine in MyFaces. I have not determined why it breaks in the RI yet. BTW, I tested 1.2_09 with no success. I'll keep looking into this and see if an RI bug needs to be filed"
