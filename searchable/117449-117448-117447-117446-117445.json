   "Two significant changes have been made with this commit as detailed", 
   "below.  For those that don't want to read it, here is the summary: you", 
   "must now update your Maven delegators in your local build files because", 
   "the Maven build files are not located in your ${maven.home} directory", 
   "anymore.  And second, extending the Maven build system should be done", 
   "using callbacks and not by adding 'depends' tags to the Maven delegators", 
   "in your local build files.", 
   "- All Maven targets now contain callback pre/post hooks that users can", 
   "implement to extend the behavior of Maven's default build system.  For", 
   "example, if you aren't happy with the maven:clean target and want it", 
   "to delete additional stuff, you can just create your own clean target", 
   "(lets call it 'my-clean') in your own build file (lets call it", 
   "'build-custom.xml').  You can then instruct maven to invoke your", 
   "target before or after the processing of the maven:clean target by", 
   "setting properties.  If you want to execute your target before the", 
   "maven:clean target executes, you'd add:", 
   "maven.core.callback.pre-clean.buildFile = build-custom.xml", 
   "maven.core.callback.pre-clean.buildTarget = my-clean", 
   "For more information on how to extend Maven, please refer to the", 
   "documentation as it has also been updated to reflect these changes.", 
   "Thanks to dion/glenn for the work they did on the plugin from which I", 
   "modeled these changes after.", 
   "- The Maven build system (build-maven.xml, build-test.xml,", 
   "build-iutest.xml, build-metrics.xml, build-docs.xml, etc ..) has been", 
   "converted into plugins (core, test, iutest, metric, docs, etc ..).", 
   "This standardizes the way the build system is generated.  Each plugin", 
   "is processed in the src/templates/build/plugins directory.  Within", 
   "each plugin directory there is an individual Control.vm file that adds", 
   "the appropriate buildElements, delegators, and callbacks for the", 
   "plugin.  The build files have also been renamed to build.xml as they", 
   "are now in their own directories and it keeps things more consistent.", 
   "In addition, all of the build files are now installed in a user's", 
   "Maven installation plugins directory.  NOTE: this means that the Maven", 
   "delegators currently in use will no longer work when the Maven install", 
   "is udpated.  You must update your maven delegators to point to the new", 
   "locations.  For example, the previous delegator:", 
   "<target", 
   "name=\"maven:site\">", 
   "<ant antfile=\"${maven.home}/build-docs.xml\" target=\"site\"/>", 
   "</target>", 
   "<target", 
   "name=\"maven:jar\">", 
   "<ant antfile=\"${maven.home}/build-maven.xml\" target=\"jar\"/>", 
   "</target>", 
   "Should be updated to the following:", 
   "<target", 
   "name=\"maven:site\">", 
   "<ant antfile=\"${maven.home}/plugin/docs/build.xml\" target=\"site\"/>", 
   "</target>", 
   "<target", 
   "name=\"maven:jar\">", 
   "<ant antfile=\"${maven.home}/plugins/core/build.xml\" target=\"jar\"/>", 
   "</target>", 
   "The full list of delegators is generated each time Maven is", 
   "bootstrapped and can be found in ${maven.home}/examples/build.xml for", 
   "those that don't feel like changing each line manually.  To keep", 
   "things simple, the plugin name is called the same as the build-xyz.xml", 
   "was, with the exception of build-maven.xml which is now located in", 
   "plugins/core directory.  In summary, UPDATE your build files that", 
   "contain maven delegators to point to the new locations.", 
   "All of the documentation has been updated as part of this change.", 
   "Thanks to glenn for the suggestion about making the core of maven a", 
   "plugin!"
