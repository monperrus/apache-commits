   "various changes and bugfixes that I noted when I developed another format implementation of the viewHelper. Diwaker Gupta noticed that I used xhtml instead of html as tag. The templates are only allowed to be imported once when 2 or more times the same contract got used. Added explanation about * matches. Renamed prepare.*.** (which prepared the final stylesheet to be used) to getStylesheet to make it more self explaning."
