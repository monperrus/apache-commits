   "Refactored the widget author information attributes into a new localized IAuthor interface to reflect the W3C spec (see WOOKIE-119). Existing methods for working with author information have been deprecated in IWidget - however the implementation provides a facade to support them. Implemented for both JPA and JCR backends."
