   "-modified printHTMLHeader - added check for $contdata being array", 
   "-modified getNavMenu - show user Current Reservations link if user has any reservations even if user does not have access to make reservations", 
   "userpreferences.php: modified userpreferences - removed \"(Vista only)\" from 32 bit color depth option", 
   "serverprofiles.php: modified processProfileInput - validate specified user groups for server profiles against any user groups instead of just those the user has access to edit", 
   "requests.php: modified AJupdateWaitTime - added javascript to save the text of the submit button so that it can be restored to what it was before changing it to \"View Available Times\"",

   "shibauth/index.php: changed cookie duration from \"SECINDAY * 31\" to 2678400 because SECINDAY is not yet defined", 
   "blockallocations.js:",

   "-added machinecntfilter", 
   "requests.js:",

   "-modified showRDPbutton - changed wait time from 5 seconds to 2", 
   "groups.js:", 
   "-modified buildUserFilterStores and buildResourceFilterStores - changed code that was using Object.keys - IE does not (always?) suppor this",
