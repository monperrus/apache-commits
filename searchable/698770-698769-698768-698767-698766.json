   "Support for rendering gadgets by directly-provided spec XML.", 
   "* The code supports both POST and GET.", 
   "* This functionality is enabled by BasicGadgetSpecFactory.", 
   "* The returned GadgetSpec object is provided with URI http://localhost/raw.xml, which prevents it from being rendered on the same locked-domain as any gadget that's not hosted remotely (ie only conflicts with localhost/raw.xml).", 
   "The rendering flow still emits an error if a (dummy/ignored) url= param isn't provided, but that's easy to work around."
