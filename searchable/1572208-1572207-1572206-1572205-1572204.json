   "The TestThriftServer is the base class for testing all HBase operations", 
   "from thrift via different thrift servers. Hence a failure in TestThriftServer", 
   "fails multiple test cases. Also TestThriftServer takes the Hbase.Iface as",

   "intermediate between the client and the hbase client). The bug is that", 
   "the TestThriftServer now assumes the Hbase.Iface to be always of type HBaseHandler,", 
   "which causes the problem. Hence, removing it.",
