   "Fixed the quickstart samples. If the client code is run inside the same VM as ant, then it will inherit the system properties but not all classpath entries from ant. This is a problem for certain ant versions that explicitly set the JAXP factory classes to Xerces (which is not on the classpath of the client code). To avoid this, use fork=\"true\"."
