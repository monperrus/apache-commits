   "Fix for WOOKIE-92 (part of WOOKIE-67) which adds an optional locale parameter to the API method for obtaining a widget instance. If the locale value is a valid language tag, it is stored with the widget instance, and is used to determine the start file URL returned. Functional tests are provided along with a localized widget to support the tests. If no locale is set, the default server locale is used instead."
