   "Unify deactivation of HTTP caching: set directives for HTTP/1.0 (Pragma) and HTTP/1.1 (Cache). Do not use 'Cache:must-revalidate' as it implies the resource can basically be cached. Do not use 'Cache:no-store' as it's superseded by 'Cache:no-cache'. Disable caching for server-side redirects (http status = 302 temporary moved) otherwise there is a chance that redirects get cached in proxies when using very aggressive caching. Set rfc-recommended 'Date' header and 'Expires'."
