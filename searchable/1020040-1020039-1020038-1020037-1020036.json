   "1. AdapterManager: refactored (re)create of adapters, to simplify; added an AggregatedAdapters class to support eagerly creating adapters, but for now have disabled this (might have been the wrong direction to go in); remapAsPersistent DOES remap any aggregated adapters for collections [factor out from object store]; when (re)create aggregated adapter for collection, also sets up the TypeOfFacet [factored out from caller]; renamed recreateAdapter -> recreateRootAdapter; added convenience removeAdapter(Oid) method; 2. PersistenceSession: renamed  madePersistent(.) -> remapAsPersistent(.); 3. Oid: promoted makePersistent() into API of Oid; modified TestProxyOid and SerialOid to have a setNewId to preserve semantics; 4. applib Query interface: IS now genericized; 5. OidGenerator no longer genericized; 6. AbstractFactory no longer genericized; 7. HibernateOidGenerator: explicit argument type checking; 8. changed --persistence -> -persistor [more to do here]"
