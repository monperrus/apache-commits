   "some additional refactoring to simplify the overall project structure. this eliminates the separate generic client jar by moving that package into the common area... implementation experience has shown that the client code pretty much will need to go everywhere the rest of the code goes so it really didn't make sense to have that off in it's own separate thing... this gives us (and developers) one less jar to keep track of... which is always a good thing."
