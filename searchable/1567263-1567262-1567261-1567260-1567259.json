   "[HBASE-10342] RowKey Prefix Bloom Filter", 
   "Author: liyintang", 
   "Summary:", 
   "When designing HBase schema for some use cases, it is quite common to combine multiple information within a RowKey. For instance, assuming that RowKey is defined as md5(id1) + id1 + id2, and user wants to scan all the RowKeys which starting by id1. In such case, the RowKey Prefix Bloom Filter is able to cut more unnecessary seeks during the scan.", 
   "This diff is to implement the RowKey Prefix Bloom Filter in HBase. And the user could define the length of the RowKey prefix through the HTable schema.", 
   "Test Plan: Run through all the unit tests",
