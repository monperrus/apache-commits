   "Commit reworked initial patch from Bruno Busco in Jira #1999; this follows Brunos work but adds the PortalPageColumn entity to configure columns, just optional pixel width for now, and also cleaned up entities and added foreign keys; rewrote a few things in screen actions and simple methods and removed a bunch of unused stuff that was commented out, so hopefully there isnt any more stray code in here; moved various things to files that were less generic, ie that mention portal specifically instead of just common or something; changed controller and menu setup so that this isn't in all apps by default, in fact just the example webapp for now with the include of portal-controller.xml and adding a dashboard menu item; note that this does not include the few changes in the specialpurpose directory, just the framework stuff for now; also moved data from seed to demo as it really isn't seed data in common and example"
