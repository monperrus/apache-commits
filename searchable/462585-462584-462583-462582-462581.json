   "A fix for the issues run into after an anonymous checkout process; this will clear the whole session when clearing the cart after checkout if the userLoginId is anonymous; the order confirmation page is then rendered with authentication using a variable that is put in a request attribute instead of the session so that after the page is rendered there are no remnants of the anonymous user; this solves a lot of funny behavior that is inconsistent with the idea of a checkout with no login"
