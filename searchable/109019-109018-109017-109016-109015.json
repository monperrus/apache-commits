   "Commit Soren Hilmer's change to support a flexible retry schedule for RemoteDelivery.", 
   "This commit also includes a concurrent change to SpoolRepository so that accept() is a one-step process that returns the Mail, rather than an unsynchronized two-step process.  Another related change is that accept() takes a filter object to control the next message to be returned, rather than hardcoding the algorithm."
