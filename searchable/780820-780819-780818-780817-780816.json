   "Added call to set the Cygwin SSHD service startup mode to auto in Windows_mod.pm::post_load(). This is necessary for images created with the old code because none of the scripts stored in the image perform this step. The update_cygwin.cmd script that gets run after an image is loaded with the new code performs this step."
