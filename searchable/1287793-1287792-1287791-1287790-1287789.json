   "Finishing up VideoPlayer/VideoElement. Added support for streaming videos and fixed a few of the bugs.  Added the skins from XD.  These still need a little tweaking, and I'll go over them with XD. For the skins, I had to add some new sub-components, like the VideoPlayerVolumeBar and VideoPlayScrubBar.", 
   "Also added 3 new events for TrackBase (thumbDrag, thumbPress, thumbRelease).  These were in Halo's Slider, and I needed them for the VideoPlayerScrubBar.", 
   "Also fixed some other bugs, like needing to call removeDynamicPartInstance() on the Slider when the dataTip is removed.  Also fixed a bug around alternatingItemsColor for ItemRenderer.",
