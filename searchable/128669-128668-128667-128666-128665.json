   "The java 1.3 JVM (I run on) throws a ClassNotFoundException whenever primitive type classes (eg Double.TYPE) are deserialized. This means that DynaProperty serialization often fails. This is a workaround for this problem. The standard serialization mechanism is replaced by a custom implementation which serialization the primitive type classes using ints. I haven't tested it on later JVMs so I'd be grateful if people out there could find the time to update and run the tests on their platform just to ensure i haven't broken things for anyone else."
