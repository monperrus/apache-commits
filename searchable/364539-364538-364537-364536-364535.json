   "- Reworked the new kernel locking stuff (now all operations should be atomic, so concurrency problems should no longer happen)",

   "- Restore the \"old\" odmg locking api and declare it deprecated, because only this way we can guarantee 100% compatibility (the old locking stuff can be enabled in OJB.properties file, by default the new was used).",
