   "QPID-1225 : Temporary commit to allow CI systems to help diagnose cause of race condition. My guess is that the session is open but closes right after the isClosed call is done. So the client the goes on and does a waitForFrame that never arrives causing the timeout exceptions. As commented in AMQPH if we add our frame listener such that it will receive any existing and subsequent exceptions, such as connection closing whilst we add them to the framelisteners then I think this will resolve the issue."
