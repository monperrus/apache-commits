   "Changed DropDownChoice so that you simply return true from wantOnSelectionChangedNotifications() in your subclass and you get calls to onSelectionChanged() via the javascript.  The default implementation of wantOnSelectionChangedNotifications() returns false, so this eliminates round trips for dropdowns that don't explicitly enable this feature."
