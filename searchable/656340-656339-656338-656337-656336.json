   "Removed GadgetSpecFetcher and MessageBundleFetcher annotations and fixed bindings to resolve exceptions being thrown after Louis' factory change (r655969). The annotations are being removed because they are no longer necessary, as GadgetSpecFactory and MessageBundleFactory provide adequate means for binding. The fetcher factories will be removed (or at least renamed and altered) in a follow up patch, but this solves the immediate problem."
