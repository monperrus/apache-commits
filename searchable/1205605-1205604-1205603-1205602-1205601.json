   "SLING-2300 Fixing support for AuthenticationInfo post processing: For anonymous requests, the AuthenticationInfo instance should always be prepared (even if it is just an empty map). This instance is then passed to the post processors and later used to access the anonymous resource resolver. In addition the J_WORKSPACE constant is removed from the AuthConstants class again because Auth Core has nothing to do with workspaces."
