   "Bring up Tuscany on top of WebSphere 6.1. Accomodate for behavior differences in HttpServletRequest.getServletPath() and getPathInfo(). Tolerate errors creating SchemaFactories on older 1.5 JDK. The core and Java runtime as well as WS bindings should now work with these fixes. Also adjusted the calculator-webapp sample to use the new TuscanyServletFilter instead of the deprecated TuscanyContextListener."
