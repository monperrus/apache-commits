   "Updated State.pm::reservation_failed to catch a case where a 'deleted' process failed. The code was just checking for is_request_deleted, then setting the computer to available and leaving the request state intact. This caused vcld to attempt to spawn deleted processes indefinitely if there was a problem with the host.",

   "Added DESTROY subroutine to vSphere_SDK.pm with an explicit call to Util::disconnect. The call is wrapped in an eval block and the die handler is overridden. Hoping to fix intermittent condition where die is called automatically when a process exits."
