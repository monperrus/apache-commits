   "At last. There was a restriction with module deployment which disabled appending SNAPSHOT at the end of the name of that module. The restriction was that the name should end with a version number. This made modules to remove SNAPSOHOT from the name which in turn lead to the problem where maven didn't update them automatically even in a change. So fixed this in Axis2 so that now one can deploy a module with the word SNAPSHOT at the end.", 
   "Deepal, if possible please verify this. I don't know whether this is a hack. Its your call."
