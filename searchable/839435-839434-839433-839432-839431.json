   "Bug fix for issue #397.", 
   "Fix up problems with build/link when --disable-shared is used.", 
   "The root problem was the use of SVN_CLIENT_DEPS. This didn't truly handle", 
   "the dependencies and link-time behavior properly (in the absence of a", 
   "recursive make with ordered subdir builds).", 
   "The fix is to recognize that the dependencies are caused by libsvn_ra,", 
   "rather than the client. Next, to associate those dependencies directly with", 
   "libsvn_ra. libtool provides for this within the .la as long as you depend", 
   "directly on .a files rather than .la files (fixed in libtool 1.4). Since we", 
   "only need the dependencies during disable-shared, the focus on .a files is", 
   "possible. As a result, when programs link against libsvn_ra.la, they", 
   "automatically pull in the other libraries (ra_dav and the fs-based libs).", 
   "* Makefile.in: toss *_CLIENT_DEPS and define SVN_RA_LIB_DEPS and", 
   "SVN_RA_LIB_LINK. _DEPS for dependency handling and _LINK for what occurs", 
   "within the link line. For static builds, these are filled in. For shared", 
   "builds, they are empty.", 
   "Remove SVN_NEON_LIBS macro (unused).", 
   "* gen-make.py: add recognition of add-deps in a definition to add arbitrary", 
   "text to a dependency line.", 
   "* build.conf: remove use of SVN_CLIENT_DEPS (see above). expand definition", 
   "of libsvn_ra to conditionally include more dependencies, and to link", 
   "against additional libraries.", 
   "* configure.in: no need to SVN_LIBSVN_* so toss the sinclude() of", 
   "svn-define-libs.m4. SVN_NEON_LIBS, SVN_TESTS_MAIN_LIBS, FS_BASED_DIRS,", 
   "and FS_BASED_TESTS are no longer used; remove them. convert definition", 
   "of LIBSVN_CLIENT_DEPS to SVN_RA_LIB_DEPS and SVN_RA_LIB_LINK.", 
   "* svn-define-libs.m4: no longer used; removed."
