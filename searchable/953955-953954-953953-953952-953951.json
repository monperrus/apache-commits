   "- Fixed positioning of Java2D-based images (when GOCA is enabled). GraphicsDataDescriptor had a bit order bug. The Graphics2D image handler didn't save state and reposition the image origin.", 
   "- Switched bitmap image handling in AFPGraphics2D to (re-)use AFPImageHandlerRenderedImage so it can profit from it's advanced image conversion functionality. This also avoids some bugs with certain image formats.", 
   "- Added enhanced dithering functionality for images that need to be converted to bi-level images."
