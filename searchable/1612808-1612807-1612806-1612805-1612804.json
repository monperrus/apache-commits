   "On the next iteration the generated port is NOT always the same as the one if the server.xml - We just get lucky sometimes.", 
   "The ServerLocal util/ServerLocal.java now used in containers checks for the server.xml, so the TCK then uses this port if found.", 
   "The RemoteServer now attempts a process waitfor and fails fast if the waitfor times out. There is no more danger of a process leak or hang until the buildbot times out."
