   "DERBY-2775 (partial) Add a method to obtain an logically immutable DataTypeDescriptor based upon a DataTypeDescriptor but with different collation settings. Add setCollationInfo methods in ValueNode to change its collation settings and hence its (soon to be) immutable data type. Use ValueNode.setCollationInfo for the simple cases where a node's collation is set from another type."
