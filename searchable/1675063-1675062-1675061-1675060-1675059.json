   "This defines the NotoSans font as default for report and FOP-PDF examples", 
   "With NotoSans by default, no need to specify the NotoSans \"font-family\" to write special characters in examples PDF (including content called from example).",

   "I also added <auto-embed/> like we have <auto-detect/> but I'm unsure of what it does exactly (I suppose it embeds the fonts glyphs in the PDF) because the FOP documentation is unclear about it (to say the least). If someone knows better please chime in!"
