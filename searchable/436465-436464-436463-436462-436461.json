   "PhaseInterceptorChain updates", 
   "* Update Phase to implement Comparable as well as hasCode and equals methods (to it can be used in hashmaps, tremaps, etc...)", 
   "* Update PhaseInterceptorChain to use an internal ListIterator to loop through interceptors (and for unwind)", 
   "* Make PhaseInterceptorChain re-entrant-ish.   An interceptor can now do \"msg.getInterceptorChain().doIntercept(msg)\" to force the rest of the chain to run, then come back to the current stack position.   Basically, it allows the \"interceptor calls next\" pattern, but doesn't require it."
