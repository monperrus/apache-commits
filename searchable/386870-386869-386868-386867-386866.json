   "1) Introduce new property derby.database.sqlAuthorization to turn on SQL standard authorization model. Default authorization is still Derby legacy authorization model, with NO support for GRANT/REVOKE.", 
   "2) If this property is set to TRUE as system property, all new databases get created with sqlAuthorization to TRUE. If this property is set at a database level, authorization mode would be switched to SQL standard mode at next database boot time.", 
   "3) Remove all changes made to defaultConnectionMode property. This property was the previous way to enable GRANT/REVOKE.", 
   "4) Disable any changes to sqlAuthorization property once SQL standard authorization is enabled. This is done to prevent switching back to Derby legacy authorization model.",
