   "[WSS-127] - Added a way of signing messages directly using a derived key from a UsernameToken", 
   "- There are now 3 ways of using a derived key from a UsernameToken to sign a message!", 
   "- TestWSSecurityNew13 shows the old way, which uses a non-standard key derivation algorithm used by WSE. This corresponds to the action \"UT_SIGNING\".", 
   "- TestWSSecurityUTDK uses the standard key derivation algorithm, but with the wsc:DerivedKeyToken for signature/encryption.", 
   "- The new test TestWSSecurityUTSignature uses the standard key derivation algorithm for direct signature.", 
   "- I had to make some modifications to the underlying logic, but the changes should be totally backwards compatible. In particular, WSSecUsernameToken.getSecretKey returns a derived key instead if \"useDerivedKey\" is set."
