   "Summary of problem(s):", 
   "1) Java2WSDL --style DOCUMENT does not work properly. (bug 12347)", 
   "a) types should be emitted in the types section (currently", 
   "no types or elements are emitted.)", 
   "b) the part element attributes are incorrect.", 
   "c) the code should use the part type attribute", 
   "for simple types, and use the part element attribute", 
   "for all other situations.", 
   "2) Java2WSDL does not have a --style WRAPPED", 
   "a) This option would be turned on for ?WSDL generation", 
   "if the service style is wrapped.", 
   "b) In this mode, element types are created which wrap", 
   "the parameter types (and output types).", 
   "c) In this mode, the message would have one part (body)", 
   "that references the wrapper element type using", 
   "the element attribute.", 
   "d) the name of the element type for a request is the", 
   "same as the operation name.", 
   "-------------------", 
   "Summary of changes:", 
   "a) Types class improved to have more descriptive methods", 
   "writeTypeForPart, writeElementForPart, and writeWrapperForPart.", 
   "These replace the existing (buggy) writePartType method.", 
   "b) Other minor simplification improvements to the Types class.", 
   "c) Emitter class changed to recognize three styles", 
   "STYLE_DOCUMENT, STYLE_RPC, and STYLE_DOC_WRAPPED.", 
   "(used to have MODE_DOCUMENT and MODE_RPC).", 
   "d) Changed all callers to the emitter to appropriately set", 
   "the style (Java2WSDL, Java2WSDLAntTask, JavaProvider).", 
   "e) Changed the emitter to implement (1) and (2).  Provided", 
   "ample comments.  Logic is actually easier to follow now!"
