   "to not be parsed in config errmsg directives.  Potential", 
   "incompatibilites are the same as the extensions of mod_include",

   "be taken as value terminators.  Ex:", 
   "<!--exec cmd=\"echo \\\"hello, world\\\"\" -->", 
   "Potential incompatibilities only to people who carelessly throw", 
   "around '\\'s. [Howard Fear]", 
   "3) Patch to fix the other part of the problem report submitted by", 
   "Ben Yoshino <ben@wiliki.eng.hawaii.edu>.  I took that approach", 
   "outlined in my email this morning and added a flag to parse_string", 
   "to pass the variable name through on the exec cmd directive when",
