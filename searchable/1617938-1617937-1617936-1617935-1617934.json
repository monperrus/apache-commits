   "Fixed a bug in Start.java reported by Justen Walker (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-5710):", 
   "The singleton pattern was broken by adding Commons Daemon support code to the class - resulting in multiple instances when using Commons Daemon.", 
   "I extracted the Commons Daemon code to a separate class - which delegates to the singleton Start instance. Users of Commons Daemon will need to update their scripts/etc to point to the new class instead of Start.", 
   "I also added a comment describing the design of Start.java, so hopefully this will help others maintain the code without breaking it."
