   "Added changes to test file for policy parser.  Policy parser will be extended to parse a complete configuration for the service-starter deployer, including classpath configuration, initialization of the application's Configuration special values and the values currently held in 'service-starter.properties'.  Decoupling this setup from the code makes it simple to allow for \"privileged\" service deployments that can manipulate the container; simply have another deployer instance that is setup to use the container's classloader as its parent, and also convey the container context into the configuration.", 
   "Also added in the deploy and deploy-privileged folders into the test configuration."
