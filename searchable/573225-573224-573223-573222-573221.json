   "fixed the classloader issues so that Camel service units can find Java RouteBuilders on the classpath and load them. Also we now by default expose a simple CamelControlBus to JBI; then any JBI consumers (or Camel endpoints) can be exposed to the NMR dynamically. We also use the Camel TypeConverter stuff to go from POJO -> Source (such as if Camel messages contain a JAXB POJO etc)"
