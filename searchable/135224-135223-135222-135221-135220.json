   "This tag is also useful as a base class for constructing arbitrary objects of certain kinds that can be configured and used in some script - such as to plug in arbitrary Actions into a workflow style script or in a simple testing framework etc."

   "o it is possible that an AntTag attribute may contain a composite expression. The old code simply called the toString on such an object which printed whatever the toString of the CompositeExpression gives which is gobblygook - instead now we use the new evaluateAsValue method to hopefully get something more useful - I can't think of a case where this would be bad and it plays better with maven so I add this fix",
