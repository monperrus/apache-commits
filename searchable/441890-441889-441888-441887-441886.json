   "add in a post_config_text option to M::SA::new() which adds the text to the end of the read-in configs, allowing for overrides of things like use_bayes and bayes_path.  the previous fix for bug 4206 broke sa-learn options which used to ignore use_bayes.  bug 3799: sa-learn --dbpath was accessing the configured bayes_path, then overrode the setting for further use.  however, that means we end up touching the configured db before overriding to the one requested.  use the new post_config_text to get around that."
