   "new factories:  we need the ability to set pre-conditions and post-conditions for each handler.handleMessage invocation.  JSR109, for example, restricts what parts of a message can and cannot be modified by a handler.  This restriction is not enforced in pure axis2, but may be in other environments.  The most convenient means is to include a plugable \"preInvoker\" and \"postInvoker\" which users of Axis2 may leverage."
