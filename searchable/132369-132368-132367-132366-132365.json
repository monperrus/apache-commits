   "This is an implmentation of overridden attribute->property name mappings for SetPropertiesRule. Some of the code plus much of the inspiration came from a patch created by Simon Kitching. The feeling on the list when this was originally discussed was that really there is no good reason why this functionality is needed - alternative mechanisms existed. Recently, one good example was posted on the user list - that of the often problematic mapping of an xml attribute named class. This patch allows attribute->property name mappings to be overriden both through standard digester constructors and through xmlrules."
