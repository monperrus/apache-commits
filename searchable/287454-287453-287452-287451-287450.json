   "Ported security patch from HEAD branch to fix Bugzilla bug 6151. Fixed security hole where resources that are protected by a security constraint could be cached by web proxies and browsers. By allowing caching, protected resources can be retrieved by unauthorized clients since web proxies and browsers are may serve a protected resource without ever passing the request to the Tomcat server where authorization would be validated."
