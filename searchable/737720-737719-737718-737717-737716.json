   "Start looking at seperating out the JMS service side listener functions into a pluggable module so different runtime environments can plug in their own runtime specific code. This should help the geronimo plugin support JMS using the Geronimo JMS provider and JCA, and any others who are using Tuscany deeply embedded in a container. Not in the build yet or used by the current JMS binding till it gets a bit further"
