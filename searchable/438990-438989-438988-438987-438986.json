   "Fixing a bug that occured when adding an user in the admin area. While testing it I found a bug related to remove an user. It seems that there is a loop in the RemovedAccreditablePolicyBuilder which first deletes the accreditable from the user management but later on tries to access it again. Resulting in org.apache.lenya.ac.AccessControlException: Unknown accreditable [user] with ID [x3x]. Not sure why that is happening, need to investigate why and fix the bug before the merge."
