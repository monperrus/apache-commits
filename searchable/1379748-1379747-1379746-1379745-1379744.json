   "QPID-4261: extend BindingURLs to allow specifying exchange durable/autodelete/internal options, use the values when sending exchange declares during producer and consumer creation. Fix ExchangeDeclareHandler to set auto-delete properly (though we dont actually support it, and it was removed from the protocol in 0-9-1).", 
   "Isolate AMQProtocolHandler use to the 0-8/0-9/0-9-1 specific Session/Producer/Consumer implementations that actually need it instead of letting it bleed through the abstraction and 0-10 implementations that dont use it. Add some other clarifying comments."
