   "For instance jQuery, even with $.datepicker.formatDate, is not able to format a date + time correctly :/", 
   "So I added a new js script: date.format-1.2.3.js. It's only 4kb, I tried to compress it online, did not work, gave up.", 
   "This is pretty basic, enough for the needs and can be easily extended when more is needed", 
   "5 mins later:", 
   "Yikes, this was pretty stupid. I completly forgot about what I thought 2 weeks ago: it's from the server I need the date-time, so I need a json service.", 
   "Then, today, I completly forgot about it, and thought again: OK, it will consume less ressources w/out a service, if  I only use javascript. A senior moment  I guess :/", 
   "I will rewrite that later, to have the real server hour...", 
   "However, the mechanism I quickly built can still be pretty useful in some cases..."
