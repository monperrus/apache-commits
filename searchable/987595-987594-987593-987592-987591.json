   "Jira 1426, to add Schema Component Designator support. This was a Google Summer of Code project. Committing the work from the student, Ishan Jayawardena. Checking into the schema 1.1 branch, because this should be considered experimental work, based on an unfinished specification. There are some limitations. a) This is only for schema 1.0. b) Certain SCDs may not work, due to limitations of the XSModel interface (e.g. XSModel is not an XSObject, identity constraints are not exposed as global components, there are interfaces to represent fundamental facets). c) The specification is not final and contains errors."
