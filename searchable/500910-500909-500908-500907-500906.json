   "Fixed a problem with the HTTP (and probably other) return codes for faults which occur while in the JAXWS layer not being set properly.  The MessageContext created as the result of a fault in the JAXWS layer will now be attached to an AxisFault and propagated back down to the transport in a manner that is consistent with how other faults flow within the system.  Instead of creating a new MessageContext, the fault handling code will simply extract the existing MessageContext from the fault and use that for the rest of the processing."
