   "Re-enabled OSGi framework integration - should work fine now", 
   "* It seems like the file and directory mode of all files in the generated OSGi bundle is '000'.  I changed it to 644 and 755 respectively for interoperability with a certain archive software (i.e. file-roller).", 
   "* Each POM of submodules now defines 'exportedPackage' to generate the bundle that contains correct classes.",
