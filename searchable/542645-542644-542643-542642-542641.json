   "DERBY-2646 (partial): Checked in new interface for internal Clob objects. The interface is added to separate concerns into different classes. The implementation classes will be added later, and EmbedClob will be rewritten to use the new interface. The initial idea is to add two different internal Clob representations; one that is read-only and operates on streams from store, and one that is read-write and stores a Clob temporarily (in memory or on disk).",
