   "6. reportAvailableServices catches ConfigurationExceptions and if they were AxisFaults underfoot, rethrow them as such, and (5) will catch and display these.", 
   "End result: stack traces don't go over the wire by default no more, and we have better reporting of trouble in things like listing available services, subclasses and log4j can control output better, etc etc."
