   "Progress on client side support for saving user preferences (RAVE-27) -- this gets us the metadata we need on the client side to build a dynamic form to collect the user prefs and send them back to our REST API on the backend to be persisted.  Note that this same metadata can/will also be used to prime the Shindig common container cache so that it doesnt need to call for gadget metadata on every page load.  Also note that we'll want to put a caching layer in the service layer at some point in the future since gadget metadata doesnt change very often.",
