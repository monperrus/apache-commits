This mailet spawns 1 (or multiple) spool threads that check the outgoing spool repository for messages that are ready to be delivered.  Service method just stores mail object directly into outgoing spool and returns rather than attempting delivery... storage in outgoing spool will trigger the delivery spool thread immediately if it isn't already busy."
