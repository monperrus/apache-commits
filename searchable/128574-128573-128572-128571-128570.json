   "Committed 'NoSuchMethod for read only properties and NullPointer when populating primitives' patch submitted by Tomas Viberg. this is one of those patches that i thought long and hard about committing. this isn't a part of beanutils that i'm particularly familiar with but no one spoke up on the list when i asked so i'm going to back my judgement. if i've got it wrong, i'm sure someone will be kind enough to commit a correction. this patch changes the behaviour of two problematic setProperty issues. when a setProperty was called on a read only method, the previous behaviour was to throw a InvocationTargetException. this patch now returns (after logging). when an primitive property was set with a null, a NullPointerException was throw. now, the null is converted."
