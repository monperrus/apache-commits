   "Only do early-rpc queueing when opted-in by a query param. This essentially disables the functionality for now. While I'd tested it to work on each transport, in-the-field reports suggest that this may break rpc on a few browsers and in some timing-sensitive scenarios (eg. different ordering of code than in the rpc profile/test harness; still being analyzed). Thus this change restores the status quo and mitigates risk."
