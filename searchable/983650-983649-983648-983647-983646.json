   "TUSCANY-3641 - process an @WebService(wsdlLocation=\"\") annotation by reading the wsdl, identified by the location, from the current contribution. The WSDL is associated with the Java component type service by attaching it to the JavaInterface normalized interface slot. This is not ideal but does allow us to pull things out of the WSDL, such a as policy. The spec state that the component type should have interface.wsdl but this messes up our databinding code which expects the component service to exhibit an interface suitable for the actual implementation."
