   "Fix bug where outstanding product quantities does not take issuances into account.  This required creating a new view entity to sum up ItemIssuances.  Also refactored a bunch of code out of orderview.bsh and created a handy method to get a distinct set of productIds in OrderReadHelper. (Useful for doing where productId IN queries.)"
