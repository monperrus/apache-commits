   "QPID-2322: Add new createUser and setPassword methods using String for passwords. Position these after the older now-deprecated char[] methods within the UserManagement interface to manipulate the MBeanInfo generated, resulting in overwriting the OperationData of the deprecated method on the old 0.5 management console and forcing use of these newer methods rather than the incompatible char[] based methods. Remove previously added compatibility check as it is no longer required. Update current management console to use the new String based methods when available.",
