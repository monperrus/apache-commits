A server runtime can use the property to disabled dynamically publishing JAX-WS endpoints via Endpoint.publish methods.",

   "On JAX-WS Client, treat local exceptions (e.g. ConnectException) as a SOAPFault, driving the JAX-WS handler handleFault methods and throwing a SOAPFAultException back through the client invocation.  Also provide a property to revert to previous behavior of creating an empty message, driving the JAX-WS handler handleMessage methods, and throwing a WebServiceException back through the client invocation."
