   "New Deployment system, which doesn't create an additional threads, and is somewhat immune to components that hangs during deployment. If the thread can be interrupted, the Deployer will throw a DeploymentException (for the rest of the activation to handle). If the thread can not be interrupted, it throws a FatalDeploymentException, which the activation system should signal upwards to kill the JVM, as there probably is a uncontrollable thread running. Any Exceptions or Errors thrown at the component level is still passed on, untampered with."
