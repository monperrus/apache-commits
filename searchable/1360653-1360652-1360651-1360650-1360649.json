   "QPID-4131: On 0-8...0-9-1 code path broker now closes the connection when the housekeeping thread times out a transaction. AMQChannel now uses AMQProtocolEngine's _receivedLock so that this connection-closing is thread-safe. This gives better compatibility with older clients that do not hand session closes correctly. 0-10 behaviour unaffected by this change."
