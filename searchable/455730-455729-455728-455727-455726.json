   "Minor: Fixed a subtle problem in converters that was manifesting itself in problems with date display in GuestBook2.  Factory configuration was essentially useless because the Session would attempt to re-configure converters rather than re-manufacturing them.  Added a nice test case for this to GuestBook2Application.  In addition, there were issues with the Timestamp subclass of Date, which was not understood by the conversion framework."
