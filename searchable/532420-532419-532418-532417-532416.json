   "Fix for ODE-112. There's a bug in Axis2, it tries to revalidate its whole prefix/namespace repository when populating a service and seems to get confused with multiple WSDL imports. It doesn't seem to impact process deployment but breaks our management web services creation if a process has been deployed before (different code path). Deploying our management stuff first fixes it, hopefully Axis2 1.1.1 will sanitize it."
