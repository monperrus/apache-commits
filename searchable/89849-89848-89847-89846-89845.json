   "This is an atypically large patch. I got half way into fixing", 
   "the profile_events API to work with keepalive when I realized", 
   "that these event \"groups\" should be off in their own files.", 
   "So:", 
   "- Updated the profile_events_t struct to handle sockets", 
   "in an abstractable way. They now have a lifetime and", 
   "their behaviour can be overriden in this manner.", 
   "- Regrouped the events in the profile_events to make", 
   "more sense. This stuff should probable be split up", 
   "into the groups (where a \"group\" is a bunch of", 
   "event functions that need to all be overriden at", 
   "once to provide some new functionality). Currently", 
   "the groups are: profile, sockets, reporting, verification.", 
   "- Moved the three implementations that we currently have", 
   "for the socket events group each into their own files.", 
   "The current flavors are: generic, ssl, and keepalive.", 
   "- Updated the various examples to work with the new", 
   "events."
