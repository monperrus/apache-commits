   "- Also add useful JRE types: Class, File, URI, URL, BigInteger, BigDecimal.", 
   "- TypeConverter.convert(String) now throws Exception because all call sites catch Exception and this also avoids all implementors to be forced to add try/catch blocks for convertions (See URL and URI converters for example.)"
