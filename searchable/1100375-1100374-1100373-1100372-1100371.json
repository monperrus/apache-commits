   "Updated Shindig connector to work with Shindig 2.0.0 (see WOOKIE-170). I've also modified the Ivy configuration so that only the very small subset of dependencies from Shindig actually required by Wookie are explicitly named and included in the deployment, as some of the downstream dependencies that we don't use can cause conflicts with the servlet container, and a lot of other jars simply aren't needed. I've tested this with Shinding 2.0.0 on Tomcat 6.0.20."
