   "Add an implementation of Abdera's Feed Object Model (FOM), forked from the original abdera-parser module. The Abdera project is now inactive and will likely be moved to the Attic. By providing a drop in replacement for abdera-parser, we enable users to continue using Abdera 1.1.3 together with the current Axiom version."
