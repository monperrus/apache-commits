   "schema 1.1 commit: assigning document URI to the XDM tree for <alternative> (using an approximation for the URI; reusing document URI of the parent document). if required, we may later create a logical URI for XDM trees for <alternative>, perhaps something like file:///alternative/file-path/x.xml (i.e we could insert an infix string like \"alternative\" within the document URI, to make it distinct from the parent document's URI). but for now, the current fix seems to meet our purpose (I attempted to solve one more XSD 1.1 test case, with this fix; and this works)."
