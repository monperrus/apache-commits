   "OPENJPA-74: Fixed multiple problems with named queries: 1. They were not being parsed as part of the orm.xml file, since we were incorrectly looking for an attribute named 'query' (when it really should have been a sub-element named 'query'). 2. Looking for a named query did not force resolution of all metadatas. 3. An NPE was being thrown when a JPQL query was created with a null filter"
