   "Unfortunately the CounterBean.constructed.await() and CounterBean.discarded.await() technique still has a little timing gap between when all the callbacks are called and when control returns to the pool and it increments its stats.  Adding a Thread.sleep(1) to park the thread after the condition is met.  I hate Thread.sleep \"solutions\" but it seems to work more reliably and can't think of a better way."
