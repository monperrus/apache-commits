   "A patch from Forrest Rae \"Postal Address PDF Formatter Screen Problems\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-6444", 
   "A couple updates are needed to the postalAddressPdfFormatter screen:", 
   "First, the screen template is set to use the HTML renderer which results in this error in the log:", 
   "[java] 2015-06-03 13:44:53,400 |0.0.0.0-8009-exec-13 |ModelScreenWidget             |W| In platform-dependent could not find template for xsl-fo, using the one for html.", 
   "Second, the various PostalAddressXXXX.fo.ftl files do not escape XML properly, and addresses with an & in them end up causing a FreeMarker template error.", 
   "Test:  For number 1, just get a \"Report\" for a quote, and then look at your log file. For number 2, add an \"General Correspondence\" address to a party that contains an ampersand, like \"5th & Oak Street\", create a quote for that Party, and then get the \"Report\" for that quote."
