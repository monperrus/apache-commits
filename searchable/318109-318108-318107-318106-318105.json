   "phase 2 of Grammar caching-related updates.  Now the new interfaces are added, and the Grammar class (now an interface) has been moved to the new xni.grammars package from its former home in impl.validation.  All classes have been changed to use the new GrammarPool.  Still to do:  1. add XSDDescription.java; 2. incorporate the new XMLResourceIdentifier into XNI callbacks; 3. extend XMLLocator from XMLResourceIdentifier; 4. make sure docs are up-to-date to reflect new ways of doing things."

   "first part of changes related to including Grammar caching API.  Renamed XSGrammarResolver to XSGrammarBucket to more accurately reflect the function of this class.  Changed XMLDTDValidator to use its own custom GrammarBucket instead of the (future) grammar pool implementation.  Also renamed impl.dtd.Grammar to impl.dtd.AbstractDTDGrammar to feflect what this class does.  All other changes made to make things compile."
