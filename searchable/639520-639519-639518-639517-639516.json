   "[MNG-3426] Cleaned up plugin-level-dependency handling to avoid two Artifacts being resolved together that are different versions of the same thing. This is a prime use case for plugin-level deps, and in handling normal POM dependencies duplicate specification is meant to result in a validation error, so this brings plugin handling into consistency with that. It also avoids any subtleties in the ArtifactCollector that could result in the old version being chosen over the new one."
