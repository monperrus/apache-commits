   "This revision includes the following changes:", 
   "* Text skin parts for Spark components changed from TextBase and RichEditableText to IDisplayText and IEditableText", 
   "* TextBase implements IDisplayText", 
   "* RichEditableText implements IEditableText", 
   "* New mobile skins for TextInput and TextArea (TextArea appearance is placeholder for now)", 
   "* Add a TOUCH_SCROLL_STARTING handler to SkinnableTextBase. This handler prevents the touch scroll from happening if the text is selectable or editable.", 
   "* Change global contentBackgroundColor to #3F3F3F and mobile application backgroundColor to #484848", 
   "Now that text skin parts are interfaces they need to be cast to concrete types in a bunch of places. There are two general approaches taken here:", 
   "* For required functionality, cast to a known type like InteractiveObject", 
   "* For optional functionality, cast to the desired type using \u201cas\u201d and wrap the code with a null check.", 
   "QE notes: Mobile TextInput is ready for testing. TextArea has some issues with resizing, so testing should wait for now.",
