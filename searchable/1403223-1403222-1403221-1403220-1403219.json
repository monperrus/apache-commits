   "STANBOL-734: Added support for all olia POS types to the Pos Enumeration. The top level is still represented by the LexicalCategory enum. The PosTag class now supports mappings based on the Pos enum. Also support for the POS type hierarchy was added. PosTags can also be assigned to multiple Pos types and/or a combination of LexcicalCategories/Pos types. Updated the Spanish, English and German TagSets to use Pos enum Mappings."
