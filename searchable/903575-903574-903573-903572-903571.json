   "After Adam's remark about formatting (actually mostly about Double instead of double), Sascha provided a new patch which was still not well formatted. So I decided to use the same formatting than in getPropertyValue. Even if it does not follow the \"brackets around blocks rule\" Sun convention. I have explained this a bit to Sascha at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-3425 \"Extend getPropertyNumber, Default Value\""
