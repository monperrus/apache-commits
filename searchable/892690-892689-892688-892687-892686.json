   "CAPTCHA has been re-written. It has been integrated into the new content-inspection system and is pluggable. ActionBean event handler methods that need CAPTCHA can simply add (1) a @SpamProtect annotation to the method declaration and (2) a <wiki:SpamProtect/> tag inside the corresponding JSP <s:form> or <form> elements. Unlike the old Captcha.jsp (which is eliminated), the new system adds CAPTCHA elements right onto the form that is being protected (via the SpamProtect tag). The new Captcha interface specifies the contract that implementations must fulfill. One CAPTCHA implementation is provided, AsirraCaptcha. ReCaptcha is likely, and will come later. More polish (i18n, CSS, JSP formatting, Install configuration) is is needed, but the current checkin works now, and will get us started. I intend to add dynamic CAPTCHA at a later point (e.g., less  trustworthy users always get a CAPTCHA to start, etc)."
