   "More work to support FXG 2.0 in the MXML Graphics library.", 
   "1. Switch blendMode default from layer to normal. Before, we did some trickery under the covers, where even though the default blendMode was layer, we actually only set it to layer when it resulted in a rendering difference (ie: when alpha was > 0 < 1 and other overlapping cases). Now, FXG 2.0 mandates blendMode default is normal \u2013 and we don\u2019t have to do that trickery because the FXG exporters are smarter and will set blendMode explicitly to layer when necessary. This change is for Group and all graphic primitives.", 
   "2. I\u2019ve added new enumerations to blendMode and maskType as well as a couple of new properties as mandated by FXG 2.0. There is additional work that needs to happen there that I\u2019ll be doing next week.", 
   "3. I\u2019ve renamed Group\u2019s resizeMode enumerations from \u2018normal\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019 to \u2018noScale\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019.", 
   "4. I\u2019ve renamed BitmapImage\u2019s resizeMode enumerations from \u2018normal\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019, \u2018repeat\u2019 to \u2018noScale\u2019, \u2018scale\u2019, \u2018repeat\u2019. The default value for BitmapImage.resizeMode went from \u2018repeat\u2019 to \u2018scale\u2019. Additionally, BitmapImage.repeat property has now been eliminated - use resizeMode=\"repeat\".", 
   "5. I\u2019ve deprecated BitmapFill\u2019s \u2018repeat\u2019 property. I\u2019ve added a \u2018resizeMode\u2019 property to BitmapFill with the same enumerations, defaults and behavior as BitmapImage. I\u2019ve also moved BitmapImageResizeMode from spark.primitives to mx.graphics. I\u2019ve also renamed BitmapImageResizeMode.as to BitmapResizeMode.as (a PARB-approved rename).",
