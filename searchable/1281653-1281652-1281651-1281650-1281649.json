   "Grid layers are now defined as type GridLayer (a private class), instead of Group.", 
   "GridLayer type no longer extends Group, it's now an object that has Group valued root property.   This makes the type's API relatively tiny - only two methods - and makes it possible for GridLayer to encapsulate the Grid itself as a layer (the item renderer layer).", 
   "Grid item renders are now consistently typed as IGridItemRenderer, rather than IVisualElement.", 
   "DefaultGridItemRenderer is now a UIFTETextField subclass and no longer supports the \"textFieldClass\" style.  A new UITextField based item renderer has been added, it's UITextFieldGridItemRenderer.", 
   "Support for the module implications of embedded fonts is now GridColumn's responsiblity.  GridColumn/itemToRenderer() now wraps item renderer ClassFactory item renders with a local ClassFactory subclass that delegates the newInstance() operation to the grid's moduleFactory.",

   "GridLayout.as - Fix bug in layoutLinearElements() where we were allowing null values to stay in newVisibleElements. We should shorten the vector instead. Also, I fixed layoutSelectionIndicators() and layoutIndicator() to remove previously cached indicators when the factory is null. Lastly, fixed up layoutRow/ColumnSeparator to return the correct bounds when no item renderer exists. This is used in the case that we clear the dataProvider.",
