   "[TRINIDAD-2378] UIXComponentBase should override clearCachedClientId to avoid calling getId() at times when the UIViewRoot isn't present", 
   "The current implementation of clearCachedClientIds on UIXComponent is final and always calls setId() with the result of getId(). The problem is that calling getId() requires a call to UIViewRoot.getUniqueId() if the component does not already have an id. Unfortunately, there are times when the UIViewRoot isn't attached to the FacesContext when we need to clear cached client ids. The easiest and fastest solution is to make clearCachedClientIds() non-final and allow UIXComponentBase to override the method to clear out its cached clientId directly."
