   "Re-Implemented \"quality\" rendering mode (painting borders and rules using bitmaps).", 
   "Added a new rendering mode \"bitmap\" (in addition to \"speed\" and \"bitmap\") that uses Java2DPainter for the whole page and paints a single bitmap (much like most PCL drivers operate). Quality: \"speed\" < \"quality\" < \"bitmap\", Performance: \"speed\" > \"quality\" > \"bitmap\" (at high page complexity \"bitmap\" might actually be better), File Size: \"speed\" < \"quality\" < \"bitmap\"", 
   "Increased bitmap encoding performance by up to 100% (by optimizing the Java code and by supporting the \"zeroed row\" PCL command)"
