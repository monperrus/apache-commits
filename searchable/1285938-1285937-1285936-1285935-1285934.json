   "Fixed bug with new Fade effect. Fade automatically manages parenting/unparenting objects which go away during a transition, but it was not doing this correctly for GraphicElements, which do not parent their underlying display object until a layout pass. This caused a failure in Rotate3D, which called a function in GraphicElement that relied on the existence of that display object parent. Fix was to force a validation to occur on the graphic element to parent it correctly and also to check for a null parent just in case.",

   "Transform improvements", 
   "http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-17312 - Fix up transform, matrix and matrix3D properties on UIComponent and GraphicElement.", 
   "When a Transform is assigned to a GraphicElement or UIComponent, we want changes to the Transform to be applied to the GraphicElement or UIComponent (component). The current implementation has the component listening for change events on the Transform. We also want the Transform to reflect changes made to the component. The current implementation doesn\u2019t do this.", 
   "The solution is when the Transform is assigned to the component, that component is assigned to the target property of the Transform. Any calls to the setters of the Transform directly assign properties of the component. The getters grab their values directly from the component. The components no longer listen for change events from the Transform.", 
   "Since the GraphicElement and IGraphicElement classes exist in the flex4 swc, they can not be used in the Transform class, which exists only in the framework swc. The solution is to use loose typing and use the \u201cproperty in object\u201d check. The change to the component classes are made in UIComponent, UIMovieClip and GraphicElement.", 
   "I added a public $transform property to UIMovieClip to access super.transform. I had to make it public because the framework swc doesn\u2019t include UIMovieClip.", 
   "I was unable to override the matrix3D setter in Transform because it was throwing an illegal override compiler error.", 
   "I had to add a setColorTransform public function to GraphicElement to handle the case where the GraphicElement\u2019s colorTransform is directly set.", 
   "myRect.transform.colorTransform = newColorTransform;", 
   "In this situation, the GraphicElement\u2019s transform object is created on demand. At this point, the GraphicElement might not have its own DisplayObject, so we need a way to store the colorTransform value until the DO is created. I had to make the function public because the \u201cin\u201d operator doesn\u2019t work with non-public namespaces.", 
   "ColorTransforms get passed around by reference, so in setColorTransform, I make a copy. This fixes some strange baseColor bug I was seeing.", 
   "http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-17680 - GraphicElement with transform matrix ignores alpha property", 
   "If the alpha property and a transform are declaratively set on a GraphicElement, then the alpha value is ignored. The reason is that the Transform object always has a default value for its ColorTransform, which sets the alpha value. The transform.ColorTransform.alphaMultiplier and alpha property are synchronized in DisplayObject.", 
   "Ideally we would throw a compiler error if both the alpha property and the transform property were set at the same time. Instead, the next best thing to do is to apply the alpha value after the ColorTransform has been applied. We can do this for GraphicElement since alpha and colorTransform are set in commitProperties. For UIComponent, alpha is applied right away. I didn\u2019t want to change that since it would probably break a whole lot of mustella tests and effect behavior. Thus this bug still exists in UIComponent.",
