   "DERBY-3354:  Select from large lob table with embedded gives OutOfMemoryError", 
   "Contributed by Anurag.", 
   "This patch introduces a new WeakHashMap in EmbedConnection. EmbedBlob and EmbedClob objects references are stored in this", 
   "map (objects as key and null as value). Adding entry to locater map is", 
   "differed till the first call of getLocater.", 
   "This ensures that there is entry of LOB objects in locater map if they are invoked in embedded mode.", 
   "As the keys of WeakHashMap doesn't prevents the objects from being", 
   "garbage collected, once the lob objects are unreferenced lob objects will", 
   "be garbage collected releasing the memory.",

   "objects from WeakHashMap and the map is cleared.", 
   "Modified files",

   "Added a new attribute lobRefrences of type WeakHashMap.", 
   "Added a new method addLOBReference to make an entry in new", 
   "hash map.",
