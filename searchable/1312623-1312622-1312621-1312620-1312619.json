   "SDK-15848 - Conditional compilation constants defined in flex-config.xml are never used if a single constant is specified on the command line", 
   "* There's a possibility this will break a conditional complication test which disallows overwriting an existing definition -- I don't know if that will break the build, but the test should be removed either way.", 
   "* Using append syntax (\"-define+=\" on the command line or ant tasks, or append=\"true\" in flex-config) and redefining a value works now if you use an already-defined namespace and name.", 
   "* So your flex-config may have -define=CONFIG::debug,false, and you may want -define+=CONFIG::debug,true from the commandline build, or FB build.", 
   "* Made the ASC ConfigVar fields final as a sanity check since overwriting is now allowed. It would be harder to track changes and subtle bugs if they were mutable. This means that you must build a new ConfigVar object if you need to make changes.", 
   "Bugs: SDK-15848", 
   "QA: Yes. Please read the updated javadocs in CompilerConfiguration. Tests need to be added to validate that overwriting is allowed, and happens correctly in different situations: I believe the order should be that flex-config is overwritten by a custom config (can we have more than one user config? is the order deterministic? I forget...), is overwritten by commandline or OEM. Did I miss any? (I didn't write code which changes this, it works however the existing configuration system allows overwriting and appending; if we have tests for that, maybe we don't need them duplicated for this feature.)",
