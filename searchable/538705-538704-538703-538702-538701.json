   "Build does not compile if :1) source files are up-to-date; 2) the pom.xml file has not been updated since last compile; 3) the nmaven-settings file has not been modified since last compile. Still need to handle: 1) changing vendor info from command line; 2) change in resources. Can use -DforceCompile to force a compile."
