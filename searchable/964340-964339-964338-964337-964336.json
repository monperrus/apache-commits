   "Revamp the way error handling is done for the API, to set some ground rules.  Specifically, LCFExceptions tossed upstream are treated as argument errors, while functional errors are caught and are returned in the protocol itself.  This makes the most sense to me from the point of view of using the API to perform a deeper integration with some other platform."
