   "A couple of minor fixes (Glen you may want to review these).", 
   "Given the discussion on the chat, the stuff in (2) probably needs", 
   "to be done for attributes.", 
   "1) JavaUtils.xmlNameToJavaName code was broken if the xmlName is a single", 
   "character capitalized name (reported by Ravi Kumar).", 
   "2) SchemaUtils.  Changed the code slightly to set the ElementDecl's name", 
   "qname to either a qualified or unqualified name.  For example:", 
   "<xsd:simpleType name=\"enum\">", 
   "<xsd:restriction base=\"xsd:string\">",

   "There are two elements inside complexAll.  The first one is named \"foo\".", 
   "\"foo\" is an unqualified name and so would be serialized as <foo>\"bar\"<foo>.", 
   "The second element is a reference to a defined root element named \"simpleType\", so", 
   "\"simpleType\" is a qualified name whose namespace context is the target namespace.", 
   "\"simpleType\" could be serialized without a prefix (if the default namespace is", 
   "set correctly) or it could be serialized with a prefix the corresponds to the", 
   "target namespace.", 
   "3) Slight change to the JavaBeanHelperWriter to write meta data if:", 
   "java name and xml names are different.", 
   "java name begins with a cap (we have run into too many problems with the", 
   "reverse mapping of such things).", 
   "element has a qualified name (namespace uri is set).", 
   "4) Changed the BeanDeserializer to first look for the qualified xml name.  If not", 
   "found and there is no prefix, search for an unqualified xml name.", 
   "5) Temporary change to BeanDeserializer to get meta data from a base class."
