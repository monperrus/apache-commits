   "Fix bugs and regressions around List selection and drag and drop", 
   "Problems:", 
   "1. DND caused regression in ctrl+click deselection because it prevented listeners for mouse up to be attached unless dragEnabled was true (SDK-24210).", 
   "2. ListBase check for commitSelection() relies on internal variables that are updated *before* calling itemSelected(). If the item selection at that point causes layout manager to validate properties before returning, the List will enter into a second commitSelection() while the first is mid-way through below on the stack. Net result is the selection is undone giving the illusion the item is not selected (SDK-24132, SDK-24105, SDK-24130).", 
   "Fixes:", 
   "1. Add listeners for mouse up when either DND is enabled, or there's pending selection on mouse up.", 
   "2. ListBase, commitSelection: commit internal variables state before calling itemSelected to prevent entering a second time into commitSelection.",
