   "SDK-15589 -  ObjectUtil.toString() not displaying the values of a Dictionary object with object keys.", 
   "* This was missing functionality in toString() -- it never worked and is a special case, keys were always toString()ed (improperly, IMO), and values were always null. This was because Dictionaries were treated as dynamic Objects that were not Arrays.", 
   "* This differs from how Array and Object toString() because keys are not just strings, they can be object references, and they can toString() to the same value if toString() is not overridden. So I recursively break down both the key and the value.", 
   "* I added curly brace syntax (rather than reusing brackets from Array] for Dictionary to distinguish its semantics from Array and Object, in case anyone is relying on this for something important. e.g. toString(dictionary) will emit  \"{3} = 3\" when dictionary[\"3\"] = 3", 
   "* getClassInfo() may now return properties that are regular objects if the input is a dictionary, whereas before it would definitely be a String or QName.",
