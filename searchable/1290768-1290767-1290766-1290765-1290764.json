   "The Border class provides a container class that can be styled with a border and a background fill or image. It has many of the same styles as HaloBorder and is used in a similar way to the Halo container classes such as Box and Canvas. Examples of styles that are supported are borderWeight, borderColor, backgroundColor, backgroundImage, cornerRadius and dropShadowVisible. The class also supports directly setting a fill or stroke instance.", 
   "Border consists of a component class and a skin class called BorderSkin. Border declares the available styles and the backgroundFill and borderStroke properties. It serves as a proxy for the styles and properties in BorderSkin. BorderSkin draws the border and background using these styles and properties. The Border class is not meant to be skinned by a different skin class. All of the style drawing logic is held in the BorderSkin class.",
