   "Fixes for ROL-1201 and 1207.  Eliminate all of the formatting stuff!  The JDK bug 5103041 that was the instigation for all of the crufty code can in our case be cleanly avoided simply by comparing long time values from getTime() rather than using Date.compareTo() which hits the bug.  The underlying JDK bug may not have been as well understood at the time the formatting code was added as a workaround."
