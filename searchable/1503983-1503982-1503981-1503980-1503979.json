   "[Trinidad]TRINIDAD-2401 Clean up skinning code to avoid use of obsolete synchronized classes", 
   "The skinning code currently uses several obsolete implementation class--Vector, Stack, HashTable that are implicitly synchronized. None of this synchronization is necessary. Replaces these classes with their modern equivalents. In addition, much of the code is confusing due to functions performing multiple different tasks simultaneously. Break these up into easy to understand pieces that perform a single task."
