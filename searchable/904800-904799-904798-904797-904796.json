   "[JSPWIKI-578] Eliminated top-level JSPs for Wiki.jsp, PageInfo.jsp, Diff.jsp, Delete.jsp and Attachments.jsp. The relevant ActionBeans are still bound to these URLs except PageInfo.jsp, but there are no longer physical JSPs for these top-level paths. The template JSPs in /templates/default now contain all of the formatting and markup and are mostly HTML and JSTL. At the moment, ActionBeans all forward to to hard-wired template JSP paths in /templates/default. A \"TemplateResolution\" class that makes forwards dynamic based on the current template will come a little later."
