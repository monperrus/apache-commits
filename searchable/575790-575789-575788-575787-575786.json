   "Took out the URL parsing logic from the AMQConnectionURL and moved in two Parser classes.", 
   "The Connection Type (0-8 or 0-10) is decided based on the URL scheme if AMQConnection is created by passing a URL.", 
   "In other cases it will be based on a jvm switch. Other constructors in AMQConnection internally constructs an 0-8 URL and call the constrcutor with a URL.", 
   "In that case it is difficult to figure out the type of connection with out additional information.", 
   "The additional information commes in the form of the following jvm arguments", 
   "SwitchCon - enables this switch", 
   "0-10 - creates an 0-10 connection and the absence of it creates an 0-8 connection", 
   "This was done to minimize any impact on the test code.", 
   "currently only one code path can be tested at a given time."
