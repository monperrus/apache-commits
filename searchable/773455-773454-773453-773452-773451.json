   "Reviewed and partially applied the remainder of Greg Kable's patches [JSPWIKI-528]. The changes I made to ComtentManager, WikiEngine and several plugins go further than those specified in the patch, and eliminate the wrapping/unwrapping in AbstractFilteredPlugin.filterCollection. Notable changes include use of Lists in preference to SortedSets, plus the use of Collections.sort(). To do this, WikiPage now extends Comparable<WikiPage>, as does JCRWikiPage. To allow pages to be returned efficiently in a specified order, ContentManager now has a method getAllPages(String,Comparator<WikiPage>)."
