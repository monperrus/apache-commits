   "This continues to allow geos Edition/Creation and to links them, but now shows also the links between geos in the Link screen. Due to native limitations of select multiples, it's not very useful in trunk but interesting in jQuery branch (I did not try to find an equivalent to asmselect in the Prototype worls, still doable...)"
