   "As a consequence of our choice to design XSModel in IDL instead of Java we ended", 
   "up creating many list type interfaces. If we had started this work in Java we", 
   "would have used java.util.List instead, an interface which is built into the Java", 
   "class library that has first class support in the Collections API and is used by", 
   "countless applications. When we revisit the XSModel for XML Schema 1.1 we should", 
   "retrofit java.util.List everywhere in the API where we are returning the XSModel", 
   "specific list types. In anticipation of this change I've updated each of the", 
   "list implementations so that they now implement java.util.List. This will make it", 
   "easier to update the API when the time comes."
