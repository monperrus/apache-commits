   "DERBY-304 submitted on behalf of Suresh Thalamati", 
   "Fix :", 
   "1) Do not allow backup path to be any derby database directory. A directory is", 
   "assumed to be a derby database directory if it has service.properties file in it.", 
   "2) copy files needed from the database home into the backup one by one", 
   "instead of recursive copy from the top directory.", 
   "3) while copying the directories under jar directory, copy each sub directory", 
   "separately without copying any subdirectories under them (There should not", 
   "be any unless if user has created explicitly or created backup at that location).", 
   "4) Log and Seg0 directory are NOT already copied recursively, this was changed as part of", 
   "online backup work (DERBY-239)."
