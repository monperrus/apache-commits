   "Added regex to utils.pm's write_currentimage_txt() subroutine to remove single quotes from the file contents before attempting to write them to currentimage.txt.  This should allow run_ssh_command() to handle the command if the user specified an image pretty name with a single quote/apostrophe.  I attempted escaping the single quotes and this did not work."

   "SLING-1208 As of Jackrabbit 1.6 the protected properties of the repository reflection of users and groups are not returned as Authorizable properties any more. Therefore the rep:principalName property which is checked in the integration test does not exist any longer. Likeweis the rep:password is not returned any more, so we have to use a (hacky) workaround."
