   "Reintroducing the dependency on the backport concurrent library that was introduced in TUSCANY-1006 for java 1.4 support and inadvertantly removed in commit  r579414.  Adding a test to ensure that we have a specific threadsafe hashmap on the classpath,  rather than letting ChangeSummaryImpl fall back on Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap()).  Have tested against maven 2.0.7 and a clean repo,  which was the issue reported in the above referenced commit."
