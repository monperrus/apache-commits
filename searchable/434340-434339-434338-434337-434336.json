   "Fixed a bug which was there hiding for some time.", 
   "OMDocument didn't serialize properly when it has text, dtd and an element as children. This made me to change the API also a bit, but I hope that won't harm anything. The reason for the api change being createOMText had no variation which took OMContainer as a parent , but always it was an OMElement. That hindered me in adding some texts as children of an OMDocument.", 
   "Even the DTD handling was not correct as lastNode and done properties were not set properly.", 
   "The bug I was trying to fix was the one pointed out my Abdera community. But that bug showed the path to this bug. Next step is to look in to that."
