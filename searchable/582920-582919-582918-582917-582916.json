   "* Workaround bug in Spring where Maps injected into contructors are always copied into LinkedHashMaps thus loosing concurrency contraints as well as causing all \"delayed\" beans to be creates/resolved immediately.  (This includes bindings, conduits, destinations, and a bunch of ws-policy assertion things).", 
   "* Create ClientOnlyHTTPTransportFactory for use with clients that don't need ws-a style callback things.  (this is part 1.   There are still areas in the code that check for transport Id's from the destinations instead of conduits.   In this case, there will not be a destination registered.)", 
   "* For our tests, don't close down the port.  It's causing all kinds of hangs on my Linux box.  (probably bug in JDK or jetty)", 
   "* Update to latest gpg plugin",
