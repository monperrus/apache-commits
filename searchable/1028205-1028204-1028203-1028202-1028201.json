   "Back-out part of change from revision 1002476 (fix for HARMONY-6638) that checks if the key is connected before OP_CONNECT is added to the list of selected keys.  Adding a test that registers an OP_CONNECT key on a socket channel, connects and then checks there's a key in the selectedKeys() list passes on the RI (also removing the check doesn't cause the regression test that was added for 1002376 to fail)."
