   "A bunch of small bug fixes.", 
   "- DataGroup bug around a visualelement being moved to another datagroup (SDK-19680)", 
   "- Added removeAllElements method to IVisualElementContainer (SDK-19424)", 
   "- Fix up ASDoc/RTE messages for Group/DataGroup/FxContainer when calling addChild(), removeChild(), etc... (SDK-19582)", 
   "- Added an mx_internal method, specifically for automation, so mouse event listeners can get added to a Container without adding a mouseshield and changing the behavior of the component (SDK-18864)", 
   "- When both skinClass and skinFactory are set, the skin doesn't get reloaded properly when skinFactory changes when it's a non-ClassFactory (SDK-19450)", 
   "- autoLayout and typicalItem properties weren't getting proxied properly on FxDataContainer (SDK-19799)", 
   "- Tabbing through two focusable items, when one of those items is partially \"offscreen\", starts the tab loop with the second item instead of the first (SDK-17283)", 
   "- Add Icon file for FxVideoDisplay and VideoElement.", 
   "- Also fixed up some ASDoc versioning info for stuff that was added in the Flex 4 timeframe but was actually added to the framework project and not the flex4 project.", 
   "- Also renaming Group.setMxmlContent -> Group.setMXMLContent to follow proper naming conventions.",
