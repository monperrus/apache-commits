   "A slightly refactored patch from Chris Howe \"visit tracking should default to on\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-1554) OFBIZ-1554", 
   "Maybe the title could have better been \"Allow requests to provide guidance on tracking\"", 
   "Refactoring : one liner syndrom, but note I kept uriString : not totally affected, some brain remains. I also wondered if keeping appStat and appVisit could provide some kind of information but finally chose to do like it was already done in lines just below. This note only to follow the discussion we had on this topic in dev ML."
