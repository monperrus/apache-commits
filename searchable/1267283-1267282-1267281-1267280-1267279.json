   "These failures are due to my code changes but I believe the old behavior was incorrect. When a control bar is the last child in a Panel it should appear at the bottom of the Panel. In the test case an ApplicationControlBar/ContorlBar is added to an empty Panel, making it the last child in the Panel. So it should appear at the bottom of the Panel instead of inside the Panel.",
