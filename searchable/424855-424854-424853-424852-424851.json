   "Adding support for svn log files to the project plugin. This work is based on the svn support which we have over in Lenya. The biggest problem with the lenya way was till now that we had one big log file that included 4 years of commits and building the file took more then 30 min. To overcome this problem I extended the project plugin with svn log processing which gives handy ways of creating smaller files and have a per month view of the svn changes."
