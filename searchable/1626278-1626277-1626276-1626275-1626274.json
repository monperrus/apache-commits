   "Commit for \"Integrate ant build-dev target in build target\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-5779", 
   "This completes the build-dev Ant target which was not yet called by the main build target, it's now done. This commit adds the todos.exe and patch.exe commands in the tools directory for patch to work on Windows w/o having to have it installed and in the path. todos.exe should not be needed in most cases, but better be safe than sorry.", 
   "It's a long time this was itching me. The main reason I did not do it already is I did not find an easy way to patch on Windows in Ant.", 
   "The documentation at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Addressing+Custom+Requirements+In+OFBiz has been updated"
