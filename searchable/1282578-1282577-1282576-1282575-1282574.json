   "Fix for change events in Slider and ScrollBar. They now dispatch change events as before, whenever the user alters the value. In addition, changeStart and changeEnd events will be dispatched at the start and end of a user interaction or animation.", 
   "TrackBase.as - Added metadata for changeStart/End events. Dispatch change, changeStart/End events when appropriate.", 
   "Slider.as - Dispatch change, changeStart/End events when appropriate.", 
   "ScrollBar.as - Dispatch the appropriate events. Note that changeStart/End will not dispatch when shift-clicking on a non-animating ScrollBar. Renamed animatingSinglePage to animatingOnce to better reflect its function. Refactored some method calls to the new private stopAnimation(), which is more consistent with Slider. Refactored the button handlers to make stepping more readable. Added a setValue call in animationEndHandler where we were ending up off the snapInterval when shift-clicking.",

   "https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-21534 - Added support for the new change and changing events pattern. \"changing\" events are now dispatched at the start of a user interaction and \"change\" events are dispatched at the end of the user interaction. For example, pressing and holding on the incrementButton of a ScrollBar will cause a \"changing\" event when first pressed and a \"change\" event when the user lets go of the incrementButton. For more information, see the wiki page (http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/change+and+changing+events).",
