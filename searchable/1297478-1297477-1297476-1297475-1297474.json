   "More JSR-223 work - added a bsh engine so that bsh-specific code can be eliminated. Bsh is now invoked using JSR-223.", 
   "The engine comes from http://java.net/projects/scripting. I had to modify the code slightly because the BshScriptEngine class implemented Compilable - but the Compilable methods were not implemented. So I removed implements Compilable. I renamed the jar to signify that the code has been modified."
