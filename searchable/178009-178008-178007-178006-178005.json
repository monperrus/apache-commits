   "Support for Updatable Resultsets in Derby Client.", 
   "Following is a brief description of the actual changes that are going into the patch", 
   "1) After updateRow(provided updateXXX were issued on the row before updateRow) and deleteRow, position the resultset to right before the next row. This matches the embedded driver behavior.", 
   "2)If ResultSet is not positioned on a row and user issues updateRow (w/o prior updateXXX), then throw an exception that it is not a valid operation. This matches the embedded driver behavior.", 
   "3)Made changes to DNC so that it does not require all the updatable columns in the sql to be modified with updateXXX prior to updateRow. This matches the embedded driver behavior.", 
   "4)To preserve case sensitivity and spaces in the names, put quotes around database object names like table name, column name, cursor name etc. Similar to embedded driver.(Positive Test31a, Test31b)", 
   "5)For a select sql like, select 2, c11 from t1, Derby has null for table name and schema name for column 2. DNC needs to check for these nulls to avoid null pointer exception.",
