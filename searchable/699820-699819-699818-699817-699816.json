   "it is now possible to apply 'home' currency payments to foreign curency invoices, converting the foreign invoice to the 'home' currency in the process and making an entry in the currency exchange table so it is still possble to display the invoice in the customer currency. To make this work, it is however required that the preferred currency of the parties are specified in the party entity. This will not affect the system if the payment and the invoice are in the same currency"
