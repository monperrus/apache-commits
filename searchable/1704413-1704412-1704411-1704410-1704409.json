   "ARIES-1404 Restart of the osgi container does not restart subsystem core because of an error related to missing resource org.apache.aries.subsystem.resource.synthesized", 
   "This issue can occur with an unresolved optional dependency as well as with an unresolved mandatory dependency in conjunction with the Application-ImportService header.", 
   "I added the filtering of synthetic resources to the computeDependencies(SubsystemManifest) method of SubsystemResource rather than the suggested location", 
   "in synthesized.patch (Bas - baselzinga@gmail.com) because it will prevent issues with other current or future headers.", 
   "The patch modifications to setImportIsolationPolicy are not appropriate because service dependencies are already included in the wiring if the implementation", 
   "has been made aware of them through one of the supported means which are (1) Require-Capability bundle headers in the osgi.service namespace, and (2) Blueprint XML.", 
   "I also added a dedicated test for this defect rather than including it in the already existing ResolutionTest as in the test-cases-1.patch (Bas - baselzinga@gmail.com)", 
   "of ARIES-1357."
