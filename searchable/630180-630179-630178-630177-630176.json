   "This patch provides:", 
   "- The ability to overwrite any feature. This allows you to maintain your own implementation of any feature without having to maintain a patch file or manually copying things over.", 
   "- The ability to serve different javascript depending on the syndicator. This allows you to, for example, serve a separate open social javascript file to a production host than you would serve to a testing deployment.", 
   "- Simplifies the feature dependency graph. Now the dependencies are just strings, which allows for registering features in any order. Note that the feature graph was never actually validated, and that continues to be the case for now. NEVER register a new feature after you've started rendering gadgets!", 
   "- Eliminated the hacky OpenSocialFeatureFactory class, since everything it enabled is satisfied (and more) by the previous changes."
