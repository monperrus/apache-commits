   "Fixed ugly NPE (with no message) when a malconfigured font was processed by the PS Renderer (even when that font is not used). When the font is used we don't get an NPE anymore but a Runtime exception. Not ideal, but a little better, especially because of the error message. I hope that at some point someone finds time to clean up the whole exception handling in FOP."
