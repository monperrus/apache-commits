   "- Changes the head elements map to list because it is important to keep the insertion order. Portlets definitely want to keep the order of contributed head elements.", 
   "- Moves head element aggregation logic from aggregator to portlet window. This enables pulling mechanism, so even root fragment can contribute head elements as well.", 
   "Also, adds getHeadElements() method in JPT and odifies velocity macro accordingly.", 
   "- Adds comments on DOMUtils' createSerializableElement() method to explain why it is like that.", 
   "Also, provides getOwnerDocument() in the returned object of DOMUtils.createSerializableElement() to allow portlet to append text node which can be created by the document.", 
   "- By the way, desktop script (core.src.js) should be improved to support keeping insertion order."
