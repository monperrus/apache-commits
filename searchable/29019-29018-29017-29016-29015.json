   "cleaned up the IE-like XML->DHTML stylesheet and ported to use standard DOM1 interfaces.", 
   "Tested with Camino, Mozilla and Safari. Safari has problems, but Safari is buggy as hell so this is not out problem. Camino and Mozilla behave differently on events, but the scripts routes around their inconsistencies. Still doesn't work on IE for mac 5.2 and I'm currently investigating why this is (for sure I'm not going to use their stupid document.all stuff to make it work)"
