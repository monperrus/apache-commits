   "method rather than a task method for good OO patterns. Well,", 
   "actually they should be target-granular but we'll see.", 
   "2)  patched all the necessary files to make the above work", 
   "3)  removed some unused methods (setAttributes())", 
   "4)  added the Filter task that addes token filtering capabilities", 
   "to all the copyFile operations. This works more or less as a", 
   "superstructure to Replace and KeySubst but automatically and", 
   "inherited by all the tasks that use copyFile() methods.", 
   "5)  indicated KeySubst as deprecated", 
   "6) updated docs to reflect this new behavior", 
   "NOTE: behavior is _totally_ back compatible if you don't", 
   "specify any <filter> tag.", 
   "NOTE2: nothing is carved in stone. If you don't like something", 
   "you're welcome to propose fixes."
