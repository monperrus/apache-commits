   "STANBOL-299: Improved Integration Test, Added Tests for Entity retrieval for ReferencedSite and SiteManager.", 
   "* Bow nearly all of the data sent in Responses is validated", 
   "* Most of that is to validate the JSON serialiser, but is also checks some semantic requirements (e.g. if the metadata of an Entity are about the Entity)", 
   "* Corrected a bug that prevented the validation of /find query tests", 
   "* Moved all the methods that asserted JSON formatted responses to a Utility class. Not they can be used similar than the org.junit.Assert class", 
   "* Added test for retrieval of Entities to the ReferencedSiteFieldQueryTest and the SitesManagerFieldQueryTest. Because they now cover the whole interface of the ReferencedSite and SiteManager RESTful service I renamed than to ReferencedSiteTest and SitesManagerTest and moved them directly into the itegration-tests package of the Entityhub", 
   "still open:", 
   "* Test for the specific services of the Entityhub (full CRUD and lookup)", 
   "* Entity mappings", 
   "* specifics tests of the RDF serialisations."
