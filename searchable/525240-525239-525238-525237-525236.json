   "bug 5313: fix spamd 'prefork: select returned -1, recovering: Bad file descriptor' error.  do this by ensuring FDs are fully cleaned up (and removed from the selector bitvec) if a child is killed, and a few other related cleanups, to fully clarify the code.  also, fix a case where write errors from child to parent were not being caught or logged, due to incorrect use of write() instead of die().  finally, add test instrumentation code, allowing simulation of certain reported system errors.  Note: this checkin also contains additional debugging log messages"

   "Added a test case showing how to use a named query with JPA along with using an annotation to mark the @Consumed method; so POJO developers can write a method to be invoked on a consume (to set a flag or update a step to the next state etc). Also performed a minor refactor to move more reusable code into the core module (for dealing with exception handling of reflection calls)."
