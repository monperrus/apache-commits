   "This patch includes both a pure Ruby and C-extension port of the Compact Protocol described in THRIFT-110. It also fixes a bug in struct.c that was interfering with native protocol method calls, and adds some utility classes to the Java library for serializing/deserializing to a file for the purpose of testing protocols cross-language."
