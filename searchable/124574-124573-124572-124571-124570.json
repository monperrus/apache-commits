   "* I first had the walker 'the other way around', producing a list of projects order by number of dependencies, which is kind annoying because of the need to call reverse(). I fixed only half of that, so it was a mess. It seems to work better now, but the sorting stuff really needs testcases.", 
   "* I added in some demo instrumentation and dynagump sql commands.", 
   "* the walker is now logging. Its real annoying that the arguments send to the get_xxx methods in config need to be updated in main and vice versa. Need to change that.",
