   "* creating a proper logging config file", 
   "* importing the new logging config file during configuration", 
   "* changing log names everywhere to use '.' as seperator instead of '-' since the logging framework assumes '.' in several places", 
   "* updating main.py to use the subprocess module that is new in python 2.4 to make the task of running svn much cleaner (and safer)", 
   "* updating sysinfo.py to also use the subprocess module", 
   "* updating the main.py code to check for python version >= 2.4", 
   "Note that if 2.4 turns out to be a problem, we can backport the subprocess module from http://www.lysator.liu.se/~astrand/popen5/ and use it with 2.3."
