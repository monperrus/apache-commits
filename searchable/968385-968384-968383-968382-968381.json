   "# Note: The reason for the large commit was the lack of internet connection", 
   "#       during the weekend.", 
   "- Added member variable $debug to parser class which controls all debug output.", 
   "# All debug code is temporary.", 
   "- Added the last operator which is the conditional ?: operator.", 
   "A special parser was required for this operator to work out.", 
   "- Fixed all 'pre' operators (++, --, !, -) to not perform precedence check since", 
   "their behaviour is different than 'post' operators. Instead they are always", 
   "placed as parameter of the current operator.", 
   "- Moved operand handling to ezcTemplateParser::handleOperand instead of having", 
   "the same code scattered across parsers.", 
   "- Some changes to Operand elements:", 
   "* Operators can choose if the parametes should be merged with other operator.", 
   "* Added function for removing last parameter.", 
   "* Made the property operator (.) on the same precedence level as the array", 
   "fetch ([...]).", 
   "- Fixed all atEnd() functions to not allow automatic finalizing of parsing if", 
   "the end is reached. This behaviour is controlled by a new parameter $finalize.", 
   "- Improved error reporting by showing the exact spot where the parsing failed.", 
   "- Added support for stopping parsing in the ezcTemplateExpressionParser", 
   "when it reaches an operator with a precedence that is lower than a given", 
   "threshold.", 
   "- Added support for function calls.", 
   "- Implemented support for escaping the block start marker to prevent it being", 
   "treated as a block but rather plain text.", 
   "- Added support for literal blocks.", 
   "- Implemented parsing of blocks and added proper nesting of them.", 
   "* Introduced new root element which is returned by the main parser instead", 
   "of an array of elements.", 
   "* Started implemenation of control structures, currently implemented foreach", 
   "loop."
