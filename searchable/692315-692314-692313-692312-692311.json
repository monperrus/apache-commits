   "Introducing class MutableHtmlContent and subclassing it with Gadget. This accommodates part 1 of SHINDIG-571.", 
   "MutableHtmlContent manages a String and its equivalent parse tree representation, ensuring with certain guarantees, as documented, that the two remain in sync. In particular, a parse tree derived from String in MutableHtmlContent cannot me modified once the source String from which it was created is changed.", 
   "This change precedes the use of MutableHtmlContent in HttpResponse, enabling consolidation of rewriting logic for both ContentRewriter APIs: Gadget-based and HttpResponse-based."
