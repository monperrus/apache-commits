   "Have begun experimenting to create a standalone executable. The idea is to use Google's closure compiler (supported by RequireJs) to create a single script file, and then to use Rhino's jsc JavaScript-to-bytecode compiler to compile it to a single executable class file. The class file is not standalone, but still requires Rhino's js.jar on the classpath to run. The committed files show this idea working for two simple examples."
