   "Here goes: propertyfile refactoring to hopefully fix all outstanding issues with it. \"now\" and \"never\" were removed as operations (didn't make sense). \"never\" was removed as a value (it caused a null pointer exception anyway).", 
   "Other code cleanup (axing \"m_\" prefixes).", 
   "Added \"unit\" attribute to <entry> defaulting to DAY. This was essentially the previous default, but it was far too confusing.", 
   "Test cases beefed up to consider several scenarios.", 
   "There may be more changes needed to satisfy other use cases, and certainly some previous (undocumented) behavior has been changed (for the better!).", 
   "Is there a use-case for \"never\" as a value?"
