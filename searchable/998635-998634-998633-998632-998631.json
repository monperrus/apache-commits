   "Partial fix for CONNECTORS-110.  Move the logic for DISTINCT ON into the database driver, and reorganize the queries to work with Derby, since its GROUP BY logic is quite different from Postgresql's.  The Derby implementation of DISTINCT ON is not correct, but will at least keep there from being exceptions."
