   "Moved urlFor() convenience methods up to Component from Page.  This actually got rid of some silly code that said \"page.urlFor(page, ...)\" , which is redundant.  I thought about moving urlFor(PageMap, ...) into PageMap, but that seems to defeat the purpose which is to conveniently expose the urlFor() logic to components.  Having urlFor(PageMap, ...) in Component will make the choice obvious to programmers in their IDE as soon as they type urlFor."
