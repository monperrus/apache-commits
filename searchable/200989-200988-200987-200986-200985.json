   "Added support for XML/XSL documents in Squiggle. Squiggle can now load an XML document and apply any referenced XSL stylesheet. This also works for self-referencing stylesheets and literal result templates. There are two examples in samples/extensions/xsl: data.xml and data.xsl. To enable XSL/XML support in Squiggle, you need to uncomment the entry in resources/META-INF/services/org.apache.batik.apps.svgbrowser.SquiggleInputHandler. Note that the mechanism used to handle XML/XSL files is generic and can be built upon to add support for other types of files and, most interstingly, for file types for which there are converters to the SVG format"
