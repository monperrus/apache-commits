   "Throw IllegalStateException when default security domain is not found. Had a lengthy discussion about this with Randi, Ate and Woonsan. A better solution would be to seed required data on portal startup. Since this requires a major refactoring of the Spring bean load phases, it was decided not to pursue that for now. To throw an IllegalStateException is ok, because the portal is required to have the default domain ID. If it doesn't, then the portal is in an unexpected, illegal state. That should never occur when the portal is seeded using the serializer: the serializer *always* inserts both the default and security domain, even when those domains are not present in the seed XML."
