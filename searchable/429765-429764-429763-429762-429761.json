   "DERBY-688: Enhancements to XML functionality toward XPath/XQuery support",

   "This patch was contributed by Army Brown (qozinx@gmail.com).", 
   "Attaching a \"phase 2\" patch that does the following:", 
   "- Adds syntax and binding logic for XMLQUERY operator", 
   "- Updates syntax for XMLEXISTS to match XMLQUERY and does some refactoring", 
   "so that the two can share code. The most user-visible change in this area", 
   "is the change from BY VALUE to BY REF syntax, which required test updates", 
   "and corresponding master file updates.", 
   "Also as part of these changes I've rewritten some of the parse logic to", 
   "make it more easily extendible to a broader XMLQUERY syntax (as defined in", 
   "SQL/XML[2006]) when/if Derby supports the broader syntax (esp. optional", 
   "context items and variable bindings) in the future.", 
   "- These phase 2 patches do *not* actually implement the XMLQUERY operator", 
   "yet; they just allow parsing and binding of the operator. Execution-time", 
   "logic will come in a subsequent patch.", 
   "For the sake of review I've separated the Phase 2 patches into two",

   "d688_phase2_v3_tests.patch: The test/master changes.", 
   "When committed, though, *both* patches should be committed together", 
   "in order to avoid test diffs."
