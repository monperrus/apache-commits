   "Scroll-to-bottom now works as expected:", 
   "- Click of the scroll to bottom button works for cyclic, filtered, etc", 
   "- Click on any row deselects scroll to bottom button and maintains selection as long as the row isn't filtered out or nuked from cyclic buffer", 
   "- Ensure that updates to the table model cause selection changes within the same call (table model update is on EDT, selection change is made while still in same call)", 
   "- Goto-line now scrolls to first column of row (was going to 2nd)", 
   "Much thanks to Jeff Kinzer for the help in getting selection working (and lots of testing!)"
