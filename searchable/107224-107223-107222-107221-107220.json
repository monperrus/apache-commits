   "Changing MailetException to extend MessagingException.  Had originally modeled exception off of ServletException, but MessagingException gives same feature (arguably better), and removes declaration of two exception types all over JAMES.  Also fixed issue with changing from user manager to user repository.  Also cleaned up remote delivery slightly so it properly starts counting retries."
