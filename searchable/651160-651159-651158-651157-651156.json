   "As we discussed in the mailing list I created a prototype deployer for transport deployment. With the deployer I wrote we can deploy transport as we deploy service or module. The only thing we need to do is to add a descriptor file called \u201ctransport.xml\u201d into the META-INF directory of the transport jar file. Then axis2 will read the xml file and populate the transport. One such an xml file can have any number of transport senders and receivers. So sample tarnsport.xml would look like below;", 
   "<transports>", 
   "<transportSender name=\"tcp\"", 
   "class=\"org.apache.axis2.transport.tcp.TCPTransportSender\"/>", 
   "<transportSender name=\"local\"", 
   "class=\"org.apache.axis2.transport.local.LocalTransportSender\"/>", 
   "<transportReceiver name=\"http\"", 
   "class=\"org.apache.axis2.transport.http.SimpleHTTPServer\">",
