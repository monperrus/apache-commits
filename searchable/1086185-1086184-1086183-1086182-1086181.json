   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-1780 - ActiveMQ broker does not automatically reconnect if the connection to the database is lost - extend the DefaultIOExceptionHandler http://activemq.apache.org/configurable-ioexception-handling.html to be aware of sql exceptions and provide a connector stop/resume option. This is now called in the event of a failure to get a jdbc connection, the default behaviour is to stop as before, but new iptions to ignore some sql exceptions or to stop/resume connectors are supported which allow a db restart to be recovered without restarting the broker"
