   "Finalized support for parallel mode: the threadpool, as suggested by Xander, should not be provided by user activators.", 
   "As a proposed solution, the threadpool is now tracked from the OSGi service registry.", 
   "And when a component is added to a DependencyManager, then a threadpool is used if there is one available from the registry.", 
   "So, a management agent bundle can simply register a java.util.Executor threadpool and must be started first (using a start level service).", 
   "If start level service can't be used, then a \"org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.parallel=true\" system property can be configured", 
   "and in this case, DependencyManager will wait for a threadpool before activating any DM components (all components", 
   "will be cached until an available threadpool is registered in the service registry)."
