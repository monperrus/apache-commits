   "- changed 'logger precision' property to represent 'number of package levels to hide' and updated logic to correctly handle numbers outside of the package count - works better if you have a consistent package hierarchy (org.apache.log4j for example) with a varying number of sub packages", 
   "- changed logFilePatternReceiver's parameter for continual processing of the file (tailing) from 'looping' to 'tailing' and added description in javadoc"

   "- updated shortcut documentation on welcome panel - find: f3, find previous: shift-f3",

   "Implemented expression-based find support",

   "- press ctrl-space or right mouse to activate the find textfield's context menu (expression help)",

   "- 'scroll to bottom' is bypassed if there is ANY text in the find field", 
   "- typing in the find field doesn't automatically perform the find - press F3 or the find button (reverse find will be added later)", 
   "- to re-activate 'scroll to bottom', clear the find field", 
   "- find history (similar to pressing enter in 'refine focus' combo box to store expression) will be added later", 
   "- will add an ANY keyword to replace the previous find capability - search across all fields"
