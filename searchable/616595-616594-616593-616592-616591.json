   "Added a first stab at a file which allows gadgets built using 0.6 to run in 0.7 containers. I do not have a good environment for testing this code because I do not have a fully working 0.7 container anywhere. Hopefully someone who does have a 0.7 container can help me find the bugs in this file and we can iterate on it together.", 
   "The idea for shindig would be to include an opensocial-0.7 feature which provides the latest container apis and an opensocial-0.6 feature which depends on 0.7 and includes this magic translation file. Once we verify the code I have written (and we make the opensocial-0.7 feature) we can proceed with that change and fix the jira issue that was filed)", 
   "(We can also version the sample container if people want that.)"
