   "Fixed bug reported by Adrian Crum and introduced with the promotion engine refactoring that I committed in rev. 1554265: under some conditions an \"ArithmeticException: Non-terminating decimal expansion\" could be thrown by the new ShoppingCart$ProductPromoUseInfo.getUsageWeight() method due to missing scale and rounding mode; this method computes a \"weight\" for the \"promotion use\" that is used to sort promotions to be applied."
