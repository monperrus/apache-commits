   "WSCOMMONS-485: For XOP/MTOM builders, wrap the underlying parser in an XOPDecodingStreamReader (and remove the decoding logic from the builder), so that the sequence of events produced by OMStAXWrapper for XOP:Include is always the same, regardless of the caching state.", 
   "With this fix, all the XOP processing is now done inside Axiom and code interacting with Axiom through StAX (XMLStreamReader/XMLStreamWriter) should no longer have to worry about XOP:Include.", 
   "The change has been successfully regression tested with Axis2 trunk."
