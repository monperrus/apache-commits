   "Added get_management_node_public_default_gateway() sub to DataStructure.pm. This was originally implemented via the hash mappings in DataStructure.pm and only returned the default GATEWAY= value configured in the vcld.conf file. The new sub still returns this value if it has explicitly been configured. If not, it attempts to determine the default gateway using the route command. If this fails, it attempts to determine the default gateway by looking for \"option routers\" lines in dhcpd.conf containing a public IP address.", 
   "Added is_public_ip_address(), is_valid_ip_address(), and read_file_to_array() to utils.pm. These are utility subroutines used by get_management_node_public_default_gateway().", 
   "Updated Windows.pm::get_public_default_gateway() to use DataStructure.pm::get_management_node_public_default_gateway(). Also changed set_static_public_address() to call Windows.pm::get_public_default_gateway() instead of the one in DataStructure.pm.", 
   "Removed unused set_static_private_ip_address() sub from Windows.pm. This code was outdated and isn't called anywhere.", 
   "VCL-195", 
   "Fixed bug in vmware.pm where it sets the guestOS line in the vmx file. It now sets this value to winnetenterprise if the OS is Windows Server 2003 or 2008.", 
   "Updated the regex that takes apart the image name in vmware.pm::capture to allow for digits in the OS part of the image name. It previously only checked for letters which caused a name such as vmwarewin2008 to fail.", 
   "Fixed bug in Windows.pm::get_network_configuration() if IPv6 was enabled. It wasn't correctly parsing the \"ipconfig /all\" output because each adapter doesn't contain \"ehternet adapter\" in the name. Added \"tunnel\" to the list of ignored interface names and descriptions. Added \"pseudo\" to the list of ignored interface descriptions.", 
   "VCL-23", 
   "Removed several outdated and unused Windows subroutines and sections of code from utils.pm. The removed code has been replaced by functionality provided by Windows.pm.", 
   "VCL-158", 
   "Fixed bug in utils.pm::setstaticaddress(). The argument list was in the incorrect order."
