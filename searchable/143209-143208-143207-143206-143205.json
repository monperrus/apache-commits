   "Added a much cleaner build.xml file from commons-digester so that proper linked JavaDoc is used as well as being much tidier alround. Added more examples, such as the RSSBeanWriter example that demonstrates using Digester to parse XML and betwixt to write it back out again. This will give us a good test case to customize the output to match the ordering and naming of the DTD. Added alpha coding of a BeanReader which extends Digester and defaults the rules based on the XMLBeanInfo for registered bean classes. Finally improved documentation, added Robert as a committer and started an overview guide."
