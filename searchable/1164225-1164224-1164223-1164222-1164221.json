   "Added loop to new.pm::process for tomaintenance requests if the computer is being used. This is likely for tomaintenance requests scheduled in the future due to the automatic reload occurring after the last reservation is complete.", 
   "Reworked computer_not_being_used subroutine to check for tomaintenance requests and several other conditions. Added code to make sure a competing reservation doesn't have any Semaphore objects open before killing the competing process for safety.", 
   "Updated utils.pm::get_request_by_computerid to return a hash reference formatted similar to the other get_* subroutines.  Updated calls in new.pm and VMware.pm."
