   "Fix build errors in openejb 2.3-SNAPSHOT. The latest xmlbeans-maven-plugin (20061223-9) doesn't work (I've filed a maven jira). An earlier version (20060627.031204-7) does work. So, use that for now... Also, surefire tests run out of PERMGEN space (it's right at the 64meg default). I'ved increased to 80megs."
