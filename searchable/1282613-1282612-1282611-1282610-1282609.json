   "Changed ScrollerLayout/updateDisplayList() to simplify the logic that deals with the case where the visible scrollbars don't fit in the available space.  In cases where a 2nd \"dependent\" auto scrollbar is added as a consequence of the first scrollbar consuming enough space to warrant that, if there isn't room for both scrollbars and the first scrollbar doesn't fit, then we don't show either of them.", 
   "The code has been revised to make judging the alternative configurations more straightforward.  The private utility methods vsbFits() and hsbFits() now take a boolean includesHSB,VSB parameter: if false the method checks if the scrollbar fits if the other scrollbar wasn't visible.", 
   "Added a pair of private utility methods hsbRequiredHeight(), vsbRequiredWidth() that encapsulate a common calculation.",
