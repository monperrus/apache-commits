   "Refactoring to make the pipelines usable outside the tree processor:", 
   "* The source resolver in AbstractProcessingPipeline is looked up from the service manager that is inserted with the setProcessorManager instead of from the EnvironmentHelper.getCurrentProccessor method. After having traced the call sequence it seem to be equivalent and from testing it seem to work.", 
   "* Changed the return type SitemapErrorHandler.prepareErrorHandler to Processing pipeline which is the same as it in Cocoon 2.1.x. Before the pipeline was embedded in a descriptor object. The only use for that in the pipeline context was that it was used for having a refernce to the container that created the pipeline and could use that for releasing the pipeline. But in the Spring Avalon implementation the release method is a noop."
