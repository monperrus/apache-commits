   "http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-22453 - [Gumbo_priority] there is no updateComplete event after a fxg component moves", 
   "SpriteVisualElement, the root class of an fxg component, will notify its parent when its width/height or constraint styles have changed. This change will notify the parent when the x/y position, rotation or scale have changed. This fixes some issues with an fxg component properly participating in layout. Also, it fixes the tooling issue of receiving an update if the layout of the fxg component has changed.",
