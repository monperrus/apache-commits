   "The following changes are made to support", 
   "the automatic conversion of deserialized arrays", 
   "into the expected array object.", 
   "1) In the Array Deserializer, the JavaUtils:convert", 
   "method is now invoked during valueComplete() to", 
   "convert the array class into an appropriate array object.", 
   "(Additional changes were made to the deserializer", 
   "to find the the appropriate array class.  Changes", 
   "were also made to reduce the lines to less than 80 chars.)", 
   "2) JavaUtils:convert(arg, destClass) was written", 
   "to assume that the arg object is a List (not an array).", 
   "Changes are made to support arg objects that are arrays.", 
   "Thus the new (more robust) code can now convert:", 
   "arrays -> other arrays", 
   "arrays -> classes that implement List", 
   "3) The runtime now returns arrays instead of ArrayList", 
   "objects.  I needed to make minor changes to some of the", 
   "tests to automatically convert to the expected ArrayList", 
   "or Vector objects.", 
   "4) Added a test to marrays that tests an echo of a", 
   "HashMap with a value which is an array.", 
   "I tested the code with ant all-tests and ran", 
   "Sam's interop tests."
