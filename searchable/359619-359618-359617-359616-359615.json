   "In the generated code, we get a pull parser from ADBBean using StaxOMBuilder, then we try to detach the document element and shove it into a envelope.getBody().setFirstChild(). During this step the whole OM is built as detach kicks off a recursive build of the whole tree. To avoid this situation, we have a new builder that creates a SOAPEnvelope/SOAPBody and makes sure that the OM tree built from the pull parser is automatically the child of SOAPBody.", 
   "Benefit: if we call serialize on the soapenvelope, we should be able to serialize the stuff from the pull parser directly into output stream (with no intermediate om tree)."
