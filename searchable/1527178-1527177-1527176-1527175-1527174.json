   "SOLR-5286: revert changes committed on this issue; the internal and 3rd party dependencies in the analysis-extras contrib are used to put these jars into the Solr distribution.  I didn't revert the compile step building the depended-on Lucene modules, since they aren't needed for compilation.  I added comments in build.xml and ivy.xml telling people not to do this again.  I reworded the README.txt to explain dependencies per feature instead of lumping them all together.  I did not revert the pom.xml.template changes, since the dependencies are not required for compilation or runtime use of the code in the analysis-extras contrib. (merged trunk r1527175)"
