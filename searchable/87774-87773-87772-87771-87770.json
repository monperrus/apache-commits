   "Add a call to apr_hook_deregister_all() in the clear_module_list function.", 
   "The basic problem was that when we load the modules, we call the", 
   "register_hooks() function from the module, but then we clear the module", 
   "list for all active modules, and add them back in one at a time.  When we", 
   "add them back, we re-call the register_hooks() function, thus adding", 
   "each function a second time.  This was causing apache.org to log every", 
   "request twice in the access log.  By calling apr_hook_deregister_all()", 
   "when we unload the module, the second call to register the hooks is the", 
   "only call that matters."
