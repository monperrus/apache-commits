   "### SolrYard:", 
   "* Added omitNorms=\"false\" to all fieldTypes, fields and dynamicField definitions of the solr schema.xml that are used for text values. This is needed to correctly process boosts at indexing time.", 
   "* The DefaultDirectoryManager no longer sets the BundleSymbolicName when asking for Solr index archives via the DataFileProvider. This allows to load indexArchives from other locations as DataFileProviders provided by the SolrYard bundle and the MainDataFileProvider. This is e.g. needed to load the default index for dbpedia form the defaultdata bundle by using the BundleDataFileProvider.", 
   "* The Classpath based DataFileProvider used by the SolrYard bundle now supports null as BundleSymbolicName", 
   "* some changes to the implementation for boosts in the SolrYard but no change in functionality", 
   "### Other changes", 
   "* removed unused directories from the dblp indexing tool", 
   "* updated the schema for indexing dbpedia to include the omitNorms=\"false\" attributes as mentioned above", 
   "* fixed a bug with LIMIT in the SparqlQueryUtils"
