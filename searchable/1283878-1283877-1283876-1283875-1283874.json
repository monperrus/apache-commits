   "Fix for SDK-16608 and SDK-16445, plus Animation API cleanup.", 
   "I've removed the class and concept of IAnimationTarget, which was a duplicate, and more direct, way of listening to animation events. But to simplify the API, I've eliminated the target concept and, instead, require users of Animation to add themselves as listeners to the various AnimationEvent event types. This fixed SDK-16445 because final values were not being sent to targets, although they were being sent to event listeners (which Animate and other new effects benefit from now).", 
   "This also fixes SDK-16608, which was caused by assuming that any target of Fade must have the 'visible' property, which is not necessarily the case (such as for the Fill object).",
