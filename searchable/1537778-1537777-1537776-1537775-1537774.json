   "Improve interpreter management", 
   "The goal of this change is to detect earlier cases when a perl interpreter", 
   "may be used by multiple threads simultaneously. This is done partly by", 
   "wrapping the interpreter allocation functions into preprocessor macros", 
   "to provide consistent trace messages and more important to reset aTHX to", 
   "NULL when the interpreter is put back.", 
   "Currently interpreter are pulled from the pool and set as context via", 
   "PERL_SET_CONTEXT. But when an interpreter is put back to the pool the", 
   "context is not reset to NULL. In an ideal world this should not be", 
   "necessary because the interpreter will not be used again. But for", 
   "debugging it's quite useful to put NULL in the perl context upon", 
   "putting back the interpreter. Thus, the program will segfault if the", 
   "thread wants to use an interpreter that already has been declared as", 
   "free.", 
   "That way a few errors where found and hopefully fixed:", 
   "* modperl_filter_f_cleanup() frees the perl-level filter context but was", 
   "called after the interpreter has already been put back.", 
   "* similar situation in request time config MERGE operations. They also", 
   "register a cleanup handler that uses the  perl interpreter. But they", 
   "do not make sure that the interpreter is bound to the request at least", 
   "up to the time the cleanup is invoked.",
