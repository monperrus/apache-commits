   "Better Auto-Centering feature checkin.", 
   "This feature makes it possible to use transform effects that auto-center on objects that change size during the effect. Previously, there would be artifacts with these operations because we would use a static transform center calculated at the effect's start time, so an object that resized would still use the old center point even though its actual center changed during the effect.", 
   "Also some unrelated bug fixes in the same code: 22857 is fixed by combining multiple effects into a single keyframe sequence more correctly (we insert new keyframes that are at the same time as existing ones by moving them forward in time by some epsilon). 22635 is fixed by removing the assumption that the target's parent is a UIComponent, grabbing transform instead of $transform if it's not a UIComponent. 22421 is fixed by the overall auto-center feature. 22802 makes protected methods private (they aren't used outside of the class, shouldn't be protected to begin with).", 
   "QE notes: Auto-Center feature ready for testing",
