   "Moved several TabBar Menus from the \"body\" decorator-section to the \"pre-body\" decorator section.", 
   "Having the TabBar menu in the \"pre-body\" seems to be the right pattern (already present in several screens) that should always be followed.", 
   "This change allows a much better rendering of the Dropping Crumbs while having a very little TabBar menu shift in other themes.", 
   "All other screens will be changed accordingly.", 
   "This commit also fixes OFBIZ-3240"
