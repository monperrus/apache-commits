   "The simple URI resolver is extended to automatically reference the local schema copies in preference to the external locations, to allow offline parsing", 
   "and generally improve performance. The schema.catalog resolver file (installed to woden jar /meta-inf at build time) contains the references to the local", 
   "schema and is generally left unaltered by the user. The regular (\"user\") catalog is optionally defined and referenced in the", 
   "usual way by the user."
