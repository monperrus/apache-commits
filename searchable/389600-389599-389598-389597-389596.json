   "2006-03-28 Removes the special OpenOffice.org support code needed for creating BSF event adapters for OOo versions <= 2.0.2; that special support code got added with revision 389218 (BSF should only contain generic code, hence removing it again). If you need to get at that code then do a svn merge with the diff of this version with revision 389218."
