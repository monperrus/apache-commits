   "Last PARB changes for FxContainer/FxDataContainer.  We're now exposing more properties on the FxContainer from the underlying Group (same for FxDataContainer and DataGroup).  The only new property being exposed on FxContainer is autoLayout.  For FxDataContainer we're now exposing autoLayout, typicalItem, and the renderer_add and renderer_remove events.  We're also being smarter about when to add events on the underlying contentGroup/dataGroup--however, we're ignoring some of the parameters in addEventListener and these aren't getting proxied down on to the listeners we add to the contentGroup/dataGroup.",

   "Change the initialization sequence of FxComponent and Group.  Basically now children (including the skin) should get created at createChildren() time and follow the correct lifecycle pattern.  Unfortunately, this change got mingled in with all my PARB changes, so I'm submitting a bunch of PARB changes for Group, DataGroup, FxContainer, and FxDataContainer, outlined below:", 
   "1.     New event classes/names for Group/FxContainer and DataGroup (\"elementAdd\" and \"elementRemove\" event of type ElementExistenceEvent for Group/FxContainer and \"rendererAdd\" and \"rendererRemove\" event of type RendererExistenceEvent for DataGroup). It was just one event class of ItemExistenceChangedEvent before.",

This means the signature for getHorizontalScrollPositionDelta(unit:ScrollUnit):Number has changed to getHorizontalScrollPositionDelta(scrollUnit:uint):Number (and ditto for getVerticalScrollPositionDelta())",

   "Other changes:", 
   "- Change IVisualElement interface so that it's smaller now.  It also extends ILayoutElement now.  The properties removed from IVisualElement are: rotation, rotationX, rotationY, rotationZ, transformX, transformY, offsets, x, y, z, scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ, explicitWidth, explicitMinWidth, explicitMaxWidth, explicitHeight, explicitMinHeight, explicitMaxHeight)",
