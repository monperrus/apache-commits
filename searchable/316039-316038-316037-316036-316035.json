   "Moved storage of event listeners from NodeImpl to DocumentImpl.", 
   "They are now stored in a hashtable where the node they are registered on is", 
   "the key. That way we save one pointer on *every* node.", 
   "Tests show a gain of 3 to 5% in memory and around 12% in performance!", 
   "Of course this is in the case where there isn't any listener. In case the", 
   "mutation events mechanism is actually used this is going to be slower,", 
   "since event listeners need to be looked for in the hashtable on the document.", 
   "But the code was broken for months without anybody noticing, so only a few", 
   "if any will see a difference. While everybody will gain from the", 
   "improvement in memory and speed.", 
   "One more drawback is that, just like with userData, a node with listeners", 
   "won't be GC'ed until the document is. Weak references would solve that."
