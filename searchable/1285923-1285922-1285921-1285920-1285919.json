   "When visible is false, we were both setting the displayObject invisible and not drawing the graphics. When visible was then set to true, we changed the displayObject visibility, but didn't draw the graphics. The fix is to always draw the graphics when we are not sharing our displayObject. This way we simply toggle visibility on the displayObject on/off, instead of having to perform a redraw.",
