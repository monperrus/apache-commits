   "AXIOM-377 (step 2): Reversed the DataHandler creation logic. In 1.2.12, the DataHandler is created by PartOnFile/PartOnMemory, i.e. after the MIME part content has been buffered. If we want to support streaming, then the DataHandler must be created before we decide whether the content is streamed or buffered and how it is buffered. Note that this implies that we now always create a DataHandler implementing DataHandlerExt. For memory buffered parts, the purgeDataSource method will simply release the allocated memory."
