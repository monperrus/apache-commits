   "-Revised the implementation for updating CMIS content repository based on RDF data such that instead of creating a folder and two documents for each object annotated in the RDF, a folder or a document is created in the repository based on the assertions related with that object e.g child, type assertions etc. Also an additional metadata document holding RDF data related with the object is created at the same level with the actual object."
