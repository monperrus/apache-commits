   "Implement support for partial data sets in the data grid.  This allows the data grid to render a data set of 10 items that might be items 1-10, 11-20, 101-110, and so on.  This supports the common scenarios where partial data sets are retrieved from a DB / web service.  Right now, this only supports partial data containing enough data for a single page, though it could be changed to support storing data for several pages.", 
   "For those interested, please give this a spin and try it out.  There are tests (samples!) included in this commit.", 
   "Test: NetUI pass"
