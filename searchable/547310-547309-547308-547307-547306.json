   "fixing a bug in the upgrade process where we set the default template for weblogs with the action='weblog' attribute.  we actually can't do this by simply applying the 'weblog' action to templates named Weblog because some older versions of Roller allowed people to modify the name of their Weblog template, so instead we need to rely on the weblog.defaultPageId property.  to do this in a database independent fashion now requires putting the code in the UpgradeDatabase code."
