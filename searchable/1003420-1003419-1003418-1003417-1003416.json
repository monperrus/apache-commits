   "A patch from Sascha Rodekamp \"The Job Sandbox should never be cached\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-3968) - OFBIZ-3968", 
   "Sascha: We noticed that OFBiz was sending cache clears over JMS every time the job sandbox is changed. That's not a problem with one OFBiz Instance but with 20, when every instance is sending JMS messages to each other ... you can imagine...", 
   "Scott: I'd agree with this, there is really no good reason to cache JobSandbox values even though I don't believe any code does this at the moment. On a side note I ran into some problems with the Job Poller when it's under a heavy load recently and as soon as I get a chance I'll be working to reproduce and fix the issues."
