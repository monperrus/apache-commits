   "Modify python test scripts to run via file:// on IBM iSeries.", 
   "There are a lot of changes here, but they all fall into one of three", 
   "categories:", 
   "1) These scripts have only been tested on Per Gummedal's iSeries Python", 
   "version 2.3.3 - http://www.iseriespython.com/, which has some", 
   "limitations:", 
   "a) os.tempnam is not implemented, tempfile.mkstemp used instead.", 
   "b) os.popen3 is not implemented, ebcdic.os400_run_cmd() used instead.", 
   "c) Files created using open() have default permissions of -rwxrwxrwxc,", 
   "different permissions explicitly set as needed.", 
   "d) os.chmod() can only handle mode bits, e.g. 00 - 04000, values greater", 
   "than that causes errno 3021, and are not used.", 
   "2) Ebcdic assumptions:", 
   "a) iSeries Python operates only on ebcdic encoded scripts, regardless", 
   "of ccsid.  Therefore string literals in the script are converted to", 
   "utf-8 with *.encode('utf-8') where appropriate.", 
   "b) Files are opened for reading and/or writing only in binary mode to", 
   "prevent OS conversion of the file contents based on CCSID.", 
   "c) Regular expressions operate only on ebcdic encoded strings.", 
   "d) When reading utf-8 text file contents in binary mode with readlines()", 
   "only one line is returned regardless of home many lines are in the", 
   "file.  os400_split_utf8_lines() from the new ebcdic.py file (r17543)", 
   "splits the line on utf-8 newlines.", 
   "3) Due to IBM APR hashing differences on the iSeries  the order of items", 
   "returned by some commands, e.g. svn status, svn propget, differ from", 
   "other platforms.  Hard coded expected output is reordered accordingly in", 
   "these cases.",
