   "Add Message.getFullContent() to retrieve full message content. The AbstractMessage does implement this with a SequenceInputStream but subclasses MAY override this for a more performant solution. Beside this Message.getHeaderContent() now MUST include the empy line as last bytes to be able to use it directly later without the need to modify it an futher.  All of this allows later implementation of zero-copy file transfer by casting to FileInputStream when possible and access the FileChannel.See MAILBOX-128"
