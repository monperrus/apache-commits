   "Change the method of generating component id's to be more in line with the JSP 2.1 JspIdConsumer (SHALE-67).   The JspIdConsumer is an interface implement by Tags.  It  forces a unique id that is the same - even for multiple requests to the page.  I modified the base configuration bean to generate a unique id per object instance.  These beans are used by clay to build the component instead of JSP tags.  The clay jspid is now used to populate the component's id if not explicitly provided."
