   "Some additional changes to LUCENE-1644 / MTQ:", 
   "- Deprecate one ctor of MultiTermQuery(Term), as Term field is deprecated", 
   "- Add readResolve also for the default auto rewrite method (not really needed because equals/hashcode impl, but singleton status is preserved)", 
   "- Some changes in NumericRangeQueryTests (now they use always constant score boolean/filter rewrite in basic tests, the default in all other tests)", 
   "- Add some explanations for the rewriteMethod used in NumericRangeQery's ctor (term enum seeks and so on). I also made a switch statement of the valSize (like at other places in this class, this is for later 8 or 16 bit valSize extensions)"
