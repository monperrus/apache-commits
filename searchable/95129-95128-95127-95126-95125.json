   "Change mod_ssl from using ssl_log() to ap_log_error().", 
   "The issue is that ssl_log doesn't handle apr_status_t result codes.  This", 
   "leads to a number of places (esp. with mutexes) where the error codes get", 
   "lost.  Rather than extending ssl_log further, since mod_ssl is part of", 
   "our core, migrate to ap_log_error.  This means that mod_ssl no longer", 
   "does its own logging.", 
   "Most uses of SSL_ADD_ERRNO are now mapped correctly to apr_status_t values", 
   "(mainly because the APIs that used to return errnos are now APRized and", 
   "have apr_status_t codes available).", 
   "SSL_LOG_TRACE and SSL_LOG_DEBUG were mapped to the APLOG_DEBUG values.", 
   "mod_ssl prints out a LOT of debugging information, so mod_ssl with LogLevel", 
   "Debug may not be a good idea - perhaps mod_ssl should be less chatty.", 
   "Numerous printf type collisions were also resolved.", 
   "(The ssl logging code itself will be removed in a subsequent commit.)", 
   "This has been discussed on dev@httpd, but the fact that there isn't", 
   "much to review besides the mindless changes, I'm going to commit now", 
   "and rely on CTR if I screwed up anything on the translation."
