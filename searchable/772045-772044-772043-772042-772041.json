   "Minor refactoring of pageExists() in WikiEngine, PageManager (legacy) and ContentManager to clarify that a page \"exists\" if it is present in the JCR and it has also been previously saved. Previously, we did not consider persistence, only if the page existed in memory in the JCR. Page-renaming code in ContentManager is now JCR-optimized (even though the renaming tests still all fail)."
