   "Fixed issue reported by Scott Gray in OFBIZ-1378; tested for save and load actual images, and for the broken case with an AgreementItactual image data and for the broken case of an AgreementItem that has no image associated with it, based on the patch from Scott but improves to be more efficient to do nothing on null, and only create a SerialBlob when needed, ie when setting it on an entity field"
