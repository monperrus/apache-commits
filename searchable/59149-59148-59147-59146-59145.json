   "Fix a parsing problem with the LDAP URL where it was truncating the host portion after it found the first :port.  Since an LDAP URL is allowed to contain multiple hosts:port, if the first host included a :port, the other hosts were ignored.  This functionality also attempted to parse-out of the URL the first :port that it found.  If one host in a multi-host URL specified the default port (ie no port specified) and the second host specified an alternate port, the result of the parse assumed that both hosts were reachable on the alternate port.  Therefore the parsed host string must retain all :port specifiers."
