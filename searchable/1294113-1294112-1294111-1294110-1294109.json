   "Fixes STANBOL-508: Removes all references to the jdom bundle managed by the springsource repository", 
   "NOTE that jdom was mainly referenced by ldpath-core. In the most current SNAPSHOT version ldpath-core now includes jdom version 1.1.2 and exlcudes the dependency to jaxen.", 
   "In addition the cnn crawler of the contenthub used htmlcleaner that also depends on jdom. In this case the htmlcleaner dependency was moved to the parnet poms and an exlusion of the jaxen dependency was defined.", 
   "This commit also updates the THIRD-PARTY license definition for the new SNAPSHOT version of LDPath.", 
   "STANBOL-500:", 
   "* removed two unused classes",
