   "A patch from Leon \"In layer mode, the attribute \"target-parameter\" of a lookup field is not used\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4136) - OFBIZ-4136", 
   "As xsd describes, \"target-parameter\" of a lookup field can be used to transfer extra parameters to lookup something. But if we choose \"layer\" mode (the default mode of lookup), this attribute does nothing. It works before jQuery introduced. I guess this feature is forgot by mistake during migration.", 
   "JLR: Nice catch! Actually IIRW it's because this has been introduced in trunk after we migrated this part in the jQuery branch and it passed \"hidden\" when I merged the trunk in branch."
