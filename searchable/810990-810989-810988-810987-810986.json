   "Always generate sstable generation numbers by atomic increment instead of leaving 'holes' that compaction uses.  Sometimes, bucketing is not perfect and the holes method will overwrite one of the being-compacted files.  Since #223 it has not been important to keep compacted files lower in generation number than newly created ones so this is both simpler and more correct.
