   "- Consolidated code that dealt with 1) form beans passed from one action to another and 2) form beans returned from nested page flows.  It's really the same thing.", 
   "- Relaxed restrictions on the 'outputFormBean' and 'outputFormBeanType' attributes.  They can now be used on any action, not just actions in nested page flows.", 
   "- Fixed an NPE when processing a @Jpf.Forward with an opaque path, like path=\"http:foo\".", 
   "- Fixed an NPE in CompilerUtils during compilation of .jpf files that used controls.", 
   "- Fixed up some ordering issues in the MockPortal/MockPortalListenTo tests.  Nothing feature-related, but by flushing some buffers the test output became more readable.", 
   "- Fixed a NoClassDefFoundError that was occurring during the netui DRT build (looking for a Velocity class).",
