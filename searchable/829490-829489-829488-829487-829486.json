   "Restructured \"tests\" Ant target so that all test fixtures used during the tests itself are now in build/tests. The original files used to construct the fixtures stay in tests/etc, but nothing in tests/etc are used when running the tests. The build/tests dir contains classes, classpath (copied from tests/etc), db (copied from etc/db), priha (the test page repository), reports (for JUnit test results) and workdir. The logfile for tests is now build/tests/jspwiki.log. In addition to these changes, the Ant tasks \"init\" and \"tests-init\" are now hooked into the Eclipse \"clean\" and \"build project\" commands as external builders. These ensure that the same test fixtures are set up if run from Eclipse."
