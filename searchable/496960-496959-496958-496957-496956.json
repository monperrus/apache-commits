   "DERBY-2197: Remove unused code for locking rows while holding a latch", 
   "The patch makes the following changes to the engine code:", 
   "1) Removes LockFactory.lockObject(..., Latch) and its implementation in", 
   "SinglePool.", 
   "2) Removes LockingPolicy.lockRecordForRead(Latch, ...) and", 
   "LockingPolicy.lockRecordForWrite(Latch, ...) and all their",

   "implementations in BasePage.", 
   "4) The only caller of Page.update() (GenericScanController.replace())", 
   "has been rewritten to use Page.updateAtSlot(), and an assert has", 
   "been added to check whether row locking is needed.", 
   "5) The only caller of Page.delete() (BTreeScan.delete()) has been", 
   "rewritten to use Page.deleteAtSlot(), and an assert has been added", 
   "to check whether row locking is needed.", 
   "The unit tests for store and LockFactory have been updated so that",
