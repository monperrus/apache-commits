   "Minor: revert changes from rev 1518615: This revision commented all server.ready.path not available in the stable launcher. This was not intended to be committed. Also added a comment explaining what paths to comment to use the integration-test module with a stable launcher. This does not have any functional changes (as all unit test do also check for availability). However typically this should result in less failed Assertions to be logged while waiting for the Server to be ready."
