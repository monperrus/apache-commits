   "Flex now requires CSS Style declarations to declare @namespace rules and disambiguate between halo and spark components using CSS 3 namespace prefixes on type selectors. At compile time, this namespace information will be used to map type names to qualified ActionScript class names. At runtime, type selectors are matched on qualified ActionScript class name (for example mx.controls.Button rather than just Button). Flex 3 applications must be compiled with -compatibility-version=3.0.0 to get unqualified CSS type selector behavior.", 
   "QE: Yes, this build may help in updating test cases to use the new namespaces and class names.",

   "New Transform effects to handle correctly doing Move, Rotate, and Scale operations simultaneously. Also, added keyframe capabilities to new effects system (necessary for the transform effects, shouldn't affect operation of other effects). Fixed various issues with effects/transition infrastructure as necessary. Added transform utility functions to UIComponent, AdvancedLayoutFeatures, and GraphicElement.",
