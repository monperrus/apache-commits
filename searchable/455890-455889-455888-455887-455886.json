   "Changed selected attribute to selected = \"selected\" to be XHTML compliant.  Added ComponentTag.syntheticCloseTagString() method which returns a close tag for the given component tag.  Changed Juergen's fix to use this method and then added another call to the same method to renderClosingComponentTag, which had been ignoring generation of close tags on /all/ openclose tags.  This problem was actually a bug in HelloWorld, if you change the <span> tag to a <span/> tag!"
