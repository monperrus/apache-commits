   "Contributor:Rich Scheuerle", 
   "Summary:", 
   "Fixed JAX-WS handler chain processing to propogate the (possibly edited) Message to the Axis2 MessageContext when the handler chain is reversed due to a \"return false\" from user's JAX-WS handler.   This ensures that the correct message is returned to the inbound handlers and client application.", 
   "Also noticed that the JAX-WS fault processing has a similar problem.  Fixed the code in that case too.", 
   "Also noticed that the JAX-WS fault processing is not examining the handler's message prior to making a new message.", 
   "This contradicts the specification.  I changed to the code to examine the current message and see if it is a fault.", 
   "If it is, then that fault is retained.", 
   "If not, then the thown protocol Exception is converted into a fault message and becomes the current message."
