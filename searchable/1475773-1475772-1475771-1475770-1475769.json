   "Fix issue #4361 (user/group names in authz files are case-insensitive).", 
   "Because of the way the original svn_config structure was designed to be", 
   "case-preserving but case-insensitive, when using it to parse authz", 
   "and group definition files, we had the following problems:", 
   "* User- and group names that differed only in case could not be", 
   "represented in the authorization configuration.", 
   "* The results returned from authorization queries depended,", 
   "although predictably, on the order in which the authz entries", 
   "appeared in the authz file.", 
   "In 1.7.0, we added an option to svn_config to make configuration groups", 
   "(hence, repository paths in the authz config) case-sensitive. This change", 
   "does the same for option names, which map to group and user names.", 
   "* subversion/include/svn_config.h",

   "additional flag as above.",

   "(svn_config_merge): Make sure both sides of the merged config", 
   "have the same case-(in)sensitive behaviour.", 
   "(svn_config_create_option): Added case-sensitive flag.",
