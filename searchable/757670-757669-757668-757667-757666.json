   "THRIFT-275. rb: Remove deprecated classes from Ruby library", 
   "This patch removes all the deprecation stuff and the t*.rb classes that were only placeholders. In addition, I've changed the implementations of some \"abstract\" methods to throw NotImplementedError instead of returning nil, and fixed the test accordingly. Finally, I removed the no longer required borrow and consume methods from all the transport implementations that had them. (Borrow and consume have been supplanted by the thrift_native package.)"
