Thai was the hardest because I did not know how to cut the sentences (it seems there are no words in Thai). I kept, in comments, the labels I was not sure about : hi_IN, ru, th and zh.", 
   "It was fun to do this, and amazing to see that all indo-european languages (in OFBiz) use something very near (for Russian I suppose because unable to read). I guess they all use a word which comes from the Latin Persona (which did not change in Italian)",
