   "Cleaning up BookmarkManager", 
   "- removed method moveFolderContents(src, dest) because it's not needed.  this is already implemented elsewhere in the code by simply changing the parent of a folder or bookmark and saving.", 
   "- removed getPath() method because it's just a dupe of folder.getPath(), which is the preferred way to accomplish the same thing.", 
   "- removed method getFolderByPath(weblog, folder, path) because it's an unnecessary dupe of getFolder(weblog, path).", 
   "- removed method removeFolderContents(folder) because it wasn't being used.", 
   "- removed method isFolderInUse(folder) because it wasn't being used.", 
   "- removed method isDuplicateFolderName(folder) because it does not need to be public.  this method is still used in the implementation class, but doesn't need to be accessed by public code because it is implied by calling saveFolder()", 
   "- there were a few tweaks to test and other classes as part of these changes."
