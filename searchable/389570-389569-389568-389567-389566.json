   "Fix for HADOOP-19.  A namenode must now be formatted before it may be used.  Attempts to start a namenode in an unformatted directory will fail, rather than automatically creating a new, empty filesystem, causing existing datanodes to delete all blocks.  Thus a mis-configured dfs.data.dir should no longer cause data loss."
