   "Ok, major update, part 3... this is a significant refactoring of the fundamental server code. The focus is on cleaning up the design, increasing flexibility, and modernizing everything. For people who have built on top of the BasicProvider interface, very little change will be noticeable... however, if you've implemented custom CollectionAdapters or Providers, then you need to pay close attention to these changes because they are significant. Overall, the new design is a major improvement and introduces a number of compelling new options. This has not been fully tested and it is quite likely that test cases are broken. I will get to fixing those either this weekend or early next week."
