   "BEANUTILS-255 - Add new generic DateTimeConverter implementation which support java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar and switch exisiting java.sql.Date, java.sql.Time and java.sql.Timestamp to use the new implementation. There was some disagreement about whether we should have support for this in BeanUtils (sse comments on JIRA/mailing list) - however, thought I would commit it for review - easily reverted in SVN if there are objections."
