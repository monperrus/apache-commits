   "Fixed problem that occurs on VMware Server 2.0 if linked clones are used. vmware-vdiskmanager can't copy the delta file and generates this error: \" Failed to convert disk: The called function cannot be performed on partial chains.\" The workaround is to make a copy of the original vmdk that the delta file is pointing to, modify the delta vmdk descriptor file and the VM's .vmsd file to point to this copy instead of the original, and then remove all snapshots from the VM. This merges the delta vmdk into the new copy.", 
   "Removed VIX_API.pm. It has never been maintained.", 
   "Changed warnings to debug messages in vSphere_SDK.pm if initialization fails. Additional warnings will be generated by VMware.pm::initialize if this was really a problem."
