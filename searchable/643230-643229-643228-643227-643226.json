   "Long story short, to get around namespace collisions with required files (which will happen more frequently once we start using gems), all the core buildr files are not under lib/buildr/ instead of just lib/, so instead of require 'foo' it's now require 'buildr/foo'.", 
   "Everything that was under lib/buildr is now relocated to addon/buildr, but still required the same way.  Possible that these will be spun into their own Gem (buildr-extra or some such) in the future."
