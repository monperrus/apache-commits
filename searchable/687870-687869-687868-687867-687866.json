   "[MNG-3698] Refactored clone methods in ModelUtils to use object construction directly instead of serialize/deserialize, refactored the StringSearchModelInterpolator to use reflection instead of serialize/deserialize, and added logic to the restore transition for the build section to detect whether the just-executed mojo actually changed anything in the core build paths or POM properties; if not, leave it concrete for the next mojo execution, otherwise determine the dynamic state once again for reinterpolation before the next mojo run. This improves performance significantly."
