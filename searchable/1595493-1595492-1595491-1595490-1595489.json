   "MSHARED-336: Added an overloaded method to DependencyGraphBuilder that accepts the reactor projects and resolves dependencies from within the reactor.", 
   "- Added multi-module-test to validate that the new method works against both direct and transitive deps.", 
   "- Added multi-module-plugin to be used to validate multi-module-test", 
   "- Added ProjectReferenceKeyGenerator as there is currently no public method to generate the key for MavenProject#projectReferences, MavenSession#projectMap or the Map of reactor projects that we will use.", 
   "- Separated the reflective invocation out into the Invoker class.", 
   "- Made maven-project dependency scope=provided as at runtime we want the version in the maven install, not 2.2.0",
