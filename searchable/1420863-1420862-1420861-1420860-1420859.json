   "PROTON-181: Modified Java and Python code to move SSL settings from the SSL object to SSLDomain. Also added resetCache() method to ProtonSslEngineFactory to allow SSLDomain to be tweaked after first use, eg allowing ssl.py to change settings mid-test. Minor refactorings to Java SSL code to improve naming, and add more JavaDoc and logging.",
