   "Reworked the Maven build files for Shale", 
   "- Modified myfaces-project.xml and added jsfri-project.xml as top-level project files that express dependencies on a particular JSF implementation.", 
   "- Changed project.xml to inherit from ${maven.shale.jsf.impl}-project.xml, which should be one of either myfaces-project.xml or jsfri-project.xml.  Thanks to Jay Hartley on maven-user for this suggestion!", 
   "- Added '-project.xml' for the case where maven.shale.jsf.impl is not specified.  It looks to 'maven.shale.jsf.impl.default' in project.properties for a value, and inherits from that project file.", 
   "- Removed Maven properties from build.properties.sample and classpath modifications based on those properties from maven.xml.", 
   "- Removed duplicate spring-web dependency and added URLs for all Spring jars in core-library/project.xml", 
   "- Reworked scripting to modify web.xml for use-cases app.  Instead of checking to see if a particular class is available, it uses the value of 'maven.shale.jsf.impl'.  This is not currently working when maven.shale.jsf.impl is set to 'jsfri'."
