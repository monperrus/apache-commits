   "The grid item renderers are using UIFTETextField and UITextField in a non-standard way.  Both are intended to inherit their styles from their parents.  They don't support setStyle() and a few of the styles (direction, locale) are actually properties so when set with MXML, the compiler finds the properties rather than the styles.  In DefaultGridItemRenderer kludge in support for direction and locale.  For both renderers, layoutDirection must be inherited so hide the layoutDirection property and style metadata from FlashBuilder and add this info to the doc.",
