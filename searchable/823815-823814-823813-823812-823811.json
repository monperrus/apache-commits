   "Tweaked the tool so it defaults to Static3DES and lists the available ciphers.  Also doesn't \"pretty\" up the output and just prints the encrypted value.  Makes it easier on command-line junkies like myself who like to pipe and script stuff (saves me from having to strip off the junk i don't care about)."
