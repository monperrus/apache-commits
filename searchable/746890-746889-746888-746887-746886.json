   "Significant rework on the view-page JSP Wiki.jsp and related tabs. The attachments tab now has its own JSP (Attachments.jsp); Upload.jsp was deleted. InfoContent.jsp was deleted and split into 2 sub-pages; PageInfoTab.jsp (for wikipages) and AttachmentInfoTab (for attachments). These last 2 names may change. Uploading, for now, is disabled but will be restored in my next checkin, with (get this) multi-file upload. Moved contents of CommentActionBean into EditActionBean; moderate nips/tucks on 5 ActionBean classes."
