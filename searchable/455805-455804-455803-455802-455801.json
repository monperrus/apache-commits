   "Added constructors to TextField that take a class as the last argument.  TextFields constructed with a type like this are considered typed and will automatically have a type validator attached to them.  In addition, even if the field is not attached to a PropertyModel, conversions will be performed to/from the given type.  Also, changed invalid to handleInvalid() and added handleValid().  This allows updateModel() to simply focus on doing that.  Finally, worked on forminput to ensure validation works completely.  Renamed the horribly named DecimalValidator to IntegerValidator and used all of this to simplify the forminput example."
