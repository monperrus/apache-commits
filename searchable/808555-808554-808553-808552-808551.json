   "When running binding-sca-axis unit tests in Eclipse I was getting javax.jms not found from Axis. Was working OK in maven. I added the package import to the Tuscany module manifest and this seems to get the tests working for me in Eclipse. It not immediately clear to me how changing this bundle helps out the Axis bundle but I've lost track a bit of the complex relationship between tuscany and axis bundles so need to look closer. This may help others in the mean time."
