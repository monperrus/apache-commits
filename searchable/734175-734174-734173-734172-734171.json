   "Fixed a bug which could cause multiple state processes to be running at the same time for a reservation.  This should never happen.  inuse.pm was clearing all computerloadlog rows for the reservation when it began processing, including the entry matching computerloadstate = 'begin'. This entry is used by vcld to determine if any other reservation processes are running before forking a new one. This caused vcld to fork an image process when a user initiates imaging while an inuse process is running.", 
   "Extended utils.pm::delete_computerloadlog_reservation to allow you to specify the load state names which shouldn't be deleted by prepending a '!' to the load state name argument.", 
   "Modified the call to delete_computerloadlog_reservation in inuse.pm to specify that 'begin' entries should not be deleted."
