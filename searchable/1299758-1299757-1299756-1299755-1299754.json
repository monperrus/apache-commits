   "-Changed initialize so that vSphere_SDK.pm is preferred over SSH. This allows vCenter to work even if SSH works to the host.", 
   "-Removed vmhost_os subroutine. It is now in OS.pm. Changed all references to $self->{vmhost_os} to !$self->vmhost_os. This uses the vmhost_os subroutine in OS.pm.", 
   "-Added usb.present parameter to prepare_vmx. This causes a USB hub to be created on the VM allowing redirected USB devices to work.", 
   "-Removed logic to check vmprofile.virtualdiskpath. This additional VM host profile setting will be removed. Things are complicated enough."
