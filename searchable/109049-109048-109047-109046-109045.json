   "Added Apache Software License v2.0", 
   "Committed some changes I started with Jason Webb while I was off-line.", 
   "1. Added TODO list", 
   "2. Changed interface to the callback object to explicitly indicate whether the operation is finished or not.", 
   "3. Changed to read lines instead of characters.  Both I/O mechanisms are still supported (I did *NOT* re-indent the code because I figure that one of these blocks will disappear when we have finished the buffering changes), selected with a conditional flag: <BUFFERING> true </BUFFERING>.  Jason Webb is working on a BufferedRandomAccessFile class, which preliminary tests suggest results in 20x performance improvement.", 
   "4. Added more DEEP_DEBUGGING messages to help with development.", 
   "5. Changed to rely upon the index.  findMessage will reload the keys (once) if selectMessage fails.", 
   "6. Pre-size the index based upon file size.", 
   "7. Use finally{} to ensure that files are closed.", 
   "8. Minor formatting fixes to log messages.", 
   "Still more to do, marked in a TODO list, but so far this code is passing all internal tests (see TODO for caveat regarding key generation related to identical messages)."
