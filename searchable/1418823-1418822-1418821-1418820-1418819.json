   "minor: Just changed some logging levels to reduce the messages on INFO level. THe OpenNLP Chunker and Pos engine now keep ad-hoc Tags (unmapped String Tags). This is also to make loggings more meaningful as only the first time that such a Tag appear an INFO message is written to the log. The goal ist to make is more easy to find those Tags by using grebs over the log files"
