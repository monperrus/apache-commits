   "A call to libspamc.c message_dump function would crash if a NULL message was received.  Thanks to Frederik Deweerdt for reporting and working on the fix.  IMPORTANT NOTE: API CHANGE: If you are building off libspamc, you must include flags now in your call.  i.e. what was message_dump(STDIN_FILENO, out_fd, &m); is now message_dump(STDIN_FILENO, out_fd, &m, flags);"
