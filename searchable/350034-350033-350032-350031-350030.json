   "PR: MNG-1113", 
   "Submitted By: Joakim Erdfelt", 
   "Reviewed By: John Casey", 
   "Applied, with changes. This patch did a good job of consolidating access to checkstyle configuration files behind a Locator class, which checked URLs, Files, and classpath resources. However, it also removed a lot of existing mojo parameters, which could have left many users high and dry. I've put the missing parameters back in, and deprecated them. Also, the report merges the deprecated parameters in with the new ones (new-parameter values win here) before proceeding. This report plugin now seems to be fully configurable for Checkstyle 3.4.", 
   "We'll need to revisit with some new functionality to get it up to snuff for Checkstyle 4.0...this will have to wait for another release."
