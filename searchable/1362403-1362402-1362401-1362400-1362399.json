   "Remove all uses of deprecated symbols no longer used by core perl and now only defined when PERL_CORE is not defined for backwards compatibility with CPAN extensions still making use of them:",

   "We actually (and arguably, wrongly) define PERL_CORE for an optimization in certain cases (but not when large files support is enabled, hence this doesn't happen often) and therefore don't get the definitions of these legacy symbols in that case. This commit fixes that, so that mod_perl can once again be built without large files support, but ideally our usage of PERL_CORE should be removed anyway."
