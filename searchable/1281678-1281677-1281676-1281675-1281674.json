   "Fixed an RTE when removing rows in GridLayout. It needed to check if the index is valid for removing elements. Also, removed logic in the dataProvider changed handler code that determined whether a visible element had changed. The collection changed handler now returns void. Lastly, I cleaned up some asdocs in DataGrid including adding the stretchCursor style metadata.",
