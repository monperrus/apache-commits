   "(VCL timings)", 
   "Updated reserved.pm to add 'acknowledgetimeout' just prior to ack checking, and to delete it after the checking. Added 'noinitialconnection' immediately after ack checking.", 
   "Updated utils.pm::delete_computerloadlog_reservation to accept a regex for more versatility.", 
   "Updated inuse.pm::process to use the initialconnecttimeout and reconnecttimeout variables.", 
   "Added call to insert computerloadlog 'connecttimeout' entry in inuse.pm before connection checking and call to remove it afterwards.", 
   "Updated State.pm::state_exit to delete computerloadlog entries correctly, as late as possible.", 
   "VCL-702", 
   "(Rework code and cleanup)", 
   "Reworked OS.pm::manage_server_access. Renamed it to add_user_accounts. This is called from OS.pm::reserve. Removed call to manage_server_access from reserved.pm. Everything now is handled by reserve which makes the sequence the same for all reservations.", 
   "Replaced update_reservation_accounts with separate add_reservation_account and delete_reservation_account subroutines in utils.pm.", 
   "Added OS.pm::delete_user_accounts.", 
   "Updated Linux.pm and Windows.pm create_user to only accept a hash reference containing the required user information.", 
   "Updated Linux.pm::reserve to not handle any \"standalone\" logic. Added Linux.pm::should_set_user_password, which is called from OS.pm::reserve to handle the \"standalone\" logic.", 
   "Updated sanitize in Linux.pm and Windows.pm to delete all user accounts, not just the request owner. Commented out section in reclaim.pm which caused server reservations to always be reloaded. This shouldn't be necessary now that all user accounts are being removed by sanitize.", 
   "Renamed changepasswd to set_password in Linux.pm and Ubuntu.pm.", 
   "Removed unused OS.pm::check_reservation_password.", 
   "Updated Linux.pm::disable_firewall_port to not fail if an attempt to disable TCP/22 is made. Instead of returning null, it now calls enable_firewall_port to enable the port only to the management node's private IP address.", 
   "Other", 
   "Updated OS.pm::is_ssh_responding to not display output."
