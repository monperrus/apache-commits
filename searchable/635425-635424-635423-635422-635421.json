   "Added granularity to the connection timeout.  The timeout was measured in seconds and is not measured in milliseconds.  Sangjin Lee provided a patch (DIRMINA-527) and I reviewed the patch.  The set/get ConnectionTimeout in AbstractPollingIoConnector that handled the seconds instead of milliseconds are being deprecated with a note to use milliseconds.  This makes sense to me and in my opinion does not take away from the robust set of methods for connectors."
