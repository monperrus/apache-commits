   "UIMA-1622 fix up pom by removing many dependencies.  Note that this doesn't actually reduce the dependencies, because most of them still are transitive dependencies.  However mvn dependency:analyze is a lot cleaner.  Also remove old imports in Test case that are not used, and add message to the SpringContainerDeployer in case of initialization error saying to look in the uima log for details."
