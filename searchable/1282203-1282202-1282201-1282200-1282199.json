   "Release Notes:", 
   "Build 183", 
   "* Fix 2559275 TextFieldHTMLImporter: <textformat> tag inside <p> tag ignores leading property; TextField doesn't", 
   "* Fix 2617284 Request: StrikeThrough Support in HTML importer, support <s> tag", 
   "* Fix 2730934, \"Editing of Measured Container with Floats can double up lines\". Bug happens when composing from the middle of the container", 
   "when we are measuring text that contains floats.", 
   "* Fix 2562965 Preserve id and class attributes through import and export", 
   "- preserved on p,span,a,img,ul,ol,li elements on import.  Not for user defined tags - will be done as part of that bug fix.", 
   "* Fix 2733620, \"Padding on intermediate elements computes incorrect bounds when measuring with the factory.\" Added checks to", 
   "finalParcelAdjust to take padding on parent chain into consideration when generated bounds.", 
   "Build 182", 
   "* Call disposeXML everywhere where XML objects are explicitly allocated, and we don't them back to the client. This should help with garbage collection.", 
   "Client code that receives XML from TLF is advised to also call flash.system.System.disposeXML when it is completely done with the XML object.", 
   "* Behavior change when editing links. If you select and type, (thus replacing what was selected with what you typed) the inserted text will now pick up", 
   "the link attributes from the start of the range being deleted if it contains a link. As you continue typing, the link will be extended to include the", 
   "new characters. In order to type plain text (drop the link attributes) you have to change the selection. This can be done in any way (e.g., click somewhere", 
   "else, use the arrow key, programmatically). Note that if you \"change\" the selection to the value it already has, it will have no effect (i.e., link",

   "although the other attributes from the deleted text are applied to the newly inserted text, link attributes are not.", 
   "* Fixing bugs in the custom clipboard code to enable same clipboard format, multiple TextConverter formats. This enables multiple filters to all try and", 
   "handle air:text, for example. API CHANGE for new TextConverter addFormatAt function, which now takes a String clipboardFormat in place of the previous Boolean.", 
   "* Normalize the flow when the interactionManager is set to non-null. This reduces the chance that users will get errors due to executing operations on",

   "Undo was being skipped if the textFlow was the same length after the delete as it was before, but",

   "* Rename HtmlImporter to TextFieldHtmlImporter and HtmlExporter to TextFieldHtmlExporter.  These are internal classes not exposed outside of the textLayout swc", 
   "Build 180", 
   "* Fix 2699246, \"Cut isn't consistent with delete when typing afterwards\". Delete was setting the pointFormat differently from Cut; now they use the same code for that.",

   "they will applied as part of the next insertion, same as if you applied bold and then inserted text. Also, if you are replacing a range of", 
   "text that has userStyles applied to it, the userStyles in the deleted text will be applied to the inserted text, unless the insertion overrides",
