   "Filter clean-up - refactored OncePerRequestFilter out to the new AbstractFilter and NamedFilter for clarity and to constrain OPRF to only already-filtered checks (overall functionality remains the same though).  Modified WebConfiguration to add a getFilterChainResolver method and deprecated the old getFilterChain method (it still functions as expected for now).  Further modifications will wait pending mailing list discussion 'Configuration: ShiroFilter vs WebConfiguration'.  Also fixed various JavaDoc/spelling mistakes."
