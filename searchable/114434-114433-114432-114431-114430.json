   "Added JUnit aggregators. Thanks to John D Taylor. John I had to change several things from your patch:", 
   "- remove tabs", 
   "- added missind documentation (xdoc)", 
   "- added missing tests", 
   "- it was not working. More specifically it would not work if the clover aggregators were used before the junit ones", 
   "- the goal caused by the junit aggregators was not the correct one... (you were calling \"test\" whereas it's the junit-report that must be called)", 
   "Please note that I had to modify both the Clover plugin and the junit-report one. So if you wish to use the junit aggregators you need to have the CVS versions of the these 2 plugins installed."
