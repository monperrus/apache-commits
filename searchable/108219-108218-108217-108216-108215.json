   "* Modified testing framework so that protocol tests can be run directly against", 
   "the ImapRequestHandler (or other generic request handler), without sending", 
   "requests over the wire. This is very useful for rapid development and debugging,", 
   "as it eliminates the deploy/start-phoenix cycle, and allows the command processing", 
   "code to be easily debugged. (Over-the-wire testing still works, using the same", 
   "protocol definition files).", 
   "* Separated the actual protocol simulation functionality from the JUnit tests,", 
   "and moved the generation of a ProtocolSession from a file into a separate builder.", 
   "This will allow different mechanisms for defining protocol sessions (eg javascript),", 
   "and different means for execution, eg JUnit, Ant task, executable, JetSpeed?"
