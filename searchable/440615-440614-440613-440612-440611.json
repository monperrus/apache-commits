   "JAMES-603.  The salient change is that we push the filter all the way down to the code that processes the ResultSet, and we don't load messages into the cache that aren't accepted by the filter.  Unfortunately, we can no longer naively call setMaxRows, since we don't know how many rows we might have to process in order to get to even ANY valid messages, so we'll have to trust the JDBC driver to use cursors properly, rather than buffer a potentially huge ResultSet in memory."
