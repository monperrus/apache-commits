   "Straightened out resource serialization issues.  IResource is now serializable and all subclasses need to implement serialization semantics, which is done for all core components now.  In particular, all DynamicImageResources now have transient input streams that are recreated using the subclass' image data.  The only non-transient image resource is BufferedDynamicImageResource, which rightly has image data that it serializes.  Also fixed problems with lastModified timestamps."

   "Testcase was broken by recent change.  Added case for empty strings and put exception throwing back in.  I don't think anything that isn't true should be false.  This can be a source of errors.  For example, if someone typos \"ture\" or \"tru\" it would be recognized as false.  I think throwing the exception is the right thing.  If there are more cases of ways that people notate false, we should add those."
