   "Yet another merge performance improvement: Potentially reduce server queries", 
   "about subtree mergeinfo during reverse merges.", 
   "Prior to this change, at the start of a merge we looked at every subtree in", 
   "the merge target with explicit mergeinfo and asked the server if that subtree", 
   "existed in the merge source.  If it didn't exist then we ignored that", 
   "subtree, since the merge couldn't change it.  Problem is, if you have a lot", 
   "of subtrees with mergeinfo this can really slow the merge down as if asks", 
   "the server about each one.  Worse, we might later need to contact the", 
   "server about these subtree's implicit mergeinfo.  If all or most of the", 
   "subtrees existed in the source then we contact the server twice for each one.", 
   "This checking of each subtree's existence in the merge source was put in", 
   "place to address issue #2877, but AFAICT subsequent fixes for issue #3067", 
   "have made these fixes moot.", 
   "This change turns off the intial checking of each subtree to see if it exists", 
   "in the merge source.  At worst the number of server round-trips will be", 
   "identical (i.e. if all of the subtrees didn't exist in the source) but in", 
   "most cases performance will improve.", 
   "Why make this change only for reverse merges?  Why not forward merges too?", 
   "Because reverse merges can only remove explicit mergeinfo, we currently", 
   "have no way of representing reverse merges from a path's natural history.", 
   "So this change will not result in different post-merge mergeinfo.  For", 
   "forward merges we would record mergeinfo on *every* subtree every time", 
   "(which I confess I thought we already were!), so the behavior would change.",
