   "Revised internal search APIs.  Changes include:", 
   "a. Queries are no longer modified during a search.  This makes", 
   "it possible, e.g., to reuse the same query instance with", 
   "multiple indexes from multiple threads.", 
   "b. Term-expanding queries (e.g. PrefixQuery, WildcardQuery,", 
   "etc.)  now work correctly with MultiSearcher, fixing bugs 12619", 
   "and 12667.", 
   "c. Boosting BooleanQuery's now works, and is supported by the", 
   "query parser (problem reported by Lee Mallabone).  Thus a query", 
   "like \"(+foo +bar)^2 +baz\" is now supported and equivalent to", 
   "\"(+foo^2 +bar^2) +baz\".", 
   "d. New method: Query.rewrite(IndexReader).  This permits a", 
   "query to re-write itself as an alternate, more primitive query.", 
   "Most of the term-expanding query classes (PrefixQuery,", 
   "WildcardQuery, etc.) are now implemented using this method.", 
   "e. New method: Searchable.explain(Query q, int doc).  This", 
   "returns an Explanation instance that describes how a particular", 
   "document is scored against a query.  An explanation can be", 
   "displayed as either plain text, with the toString() method, or", 
   "as HTML, with the toHtml() method.  Note that computing an", 
   "explanation is as expensive as executing the query over the", 
   "entire index.  This is intended to be used in developing", 
   "Similarity implementations, and, for good performance, should", 
   "not be displayed with every hit.", 
   "f. Scorer and Weight are public, not package protected.  It now", 
   "possible for someone to write a Scorer implementation that is", 
   "not in the org.apache.lucene.search package.  This is still", 
   "fairly advanced programming, and I don't expect anyone to do", 
   "this anytime soon, but at least now it is possible.", 
   "Caution: These are extensive changes and they have not yet been", 
   "tested extensively.  Bug reports are appreciated."
