   "PROTON-596: Add cmake configure_file to customize config.bat for windows builds.", 
   "1. Cmake on windows produces all four cmake configurations (debug, relwithdebinfo, ...) on one pass. Producing N config.bat files, one for each configuration, seems like overkill. The build produces just one config.bat that that is set up for RelWithDebInfo.", 
   "2. The prototype bash file config.sh does several conditional tests for sensing the build and changing the environment accordingly. The windows version flattens these tests out and forces the settings every time. It's easier to understand this way and requires a lot less testing for proof. Only the Python binding has been exercised; Ruby, Perl, and PHP not so much.",
