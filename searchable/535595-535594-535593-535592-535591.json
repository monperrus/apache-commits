   "Move WorkContextImpl to the spi module. This doesn't seem quite right but it seems better than having extensions like axis2, rmi etc having a dependency on the core module like they used to. Also changed the workcontext threadlocal to have an initializer to create a new workcontext which works like the rmi and axis2 binding were doing which isn't the same as the way the runtime is creating one so is probably wrong, but at least the code only needs fixing in one place now"
