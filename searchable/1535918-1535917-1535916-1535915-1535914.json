   "Rewriting OctalUnescaper as a hand rolled parser (all of 4 characters), instead of trying to handle the conversion via repeated attempts to convert the numbers. This fixes bugs, see LANG-929, and also changes the behaviour for 'illegal' octals such as \\999. Instead of throwing NumberFormatException, it will now ignore them. This seems the better behaviour."
