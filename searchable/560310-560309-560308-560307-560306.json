   "Changed the implementation of model type specific model resolvers to handle the model resolution in a model type specific way instead of delegating to the base DefaultModelResolver, for example index models by their qname or namespace. Removed dependency on ClassLoader in these resolvers as it was just dragged from DefaultModelResolver. The new resolvers do not need to extend DefaultModelResolver anymore. Further cleanup will be required when the Java class model resolver is available, as DefaultModelResolver and ExtensibleModelResolver won't have to handle classes as a special case anymore."
