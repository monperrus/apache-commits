   "Portlet Instances feature implemented with tests. Note I had to rename this feature Portlet Clones since the concept of Portlet Instances is used (albeit at a low level) all over the codebase. This commit is considered Phase 1 of 2, and includes the core implementation, as well as basic integration into j2-admin PAM, and the Jetspeed Toolbox search. Phase II will encompass improving the PAM and Toolbox to further support administration of clones. This commit introduces an new column CLONE_PARENT to the PORTLET_DEFINITION table. Schema change requirements will be documented in release notes and migration docs."
