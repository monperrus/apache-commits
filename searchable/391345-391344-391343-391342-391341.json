   "Fix for BEEHIVE-1091.  This is a great bug -- the <checkBoxGroup>, <select>, and <radioButtonGroup> tags didn't work inside of the data grid / repeater or any other tags that iterate over a data set.  The problem was that the expressions returned from the tags' implementation of IDataAccessProvider didn't provide an expression -- they just provided a literal string.", 
   "The way this expression rewriting stuff works is weird, but it does require that the tags return expression strings in order to recognize them as expressions rather than literal text.", 
   "This is fixed now with a new test added to the web application.",
