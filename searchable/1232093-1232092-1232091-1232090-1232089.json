   "[SUREFIRE-806] Adding parameter 'failIfNoSpecifiedTests' and separating -Dtest=... specified tests from includes, so they will not be included in every execution of the test mojo automatically. If a -Dtest=... class is not already included via the <includes/> of an execution, it will not be run in that execution. If -DfailIfNoSpecifiedTests=true and no specified tests are available in a particular execution of the plugin, the build will fail. When using -Dtest=... the plugin will now check if a value is set for -DfailIfNoSpecifiedTests, then -DfailIfNoTests, then default to fail if no specified test is present in a particular execution.", 
   "Still need integration tests for this feature, and may need a more careful examination of what happens with -Dtest using some test class that's not normally included, when there's only a single execution."
