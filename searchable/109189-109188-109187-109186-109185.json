   "Additional adjustments to fix JAMES-264.  InternetHeaders is an awkward class to work with due its own internal handling of header order.  This change takes advantage of how InternetHeaders works, pre-placing a null placeholder for a possible Return-Path header so that when setHeader is called, it will use that placeholder, and remove any other Return-Path headers.  It also ensures that there are no other placeholders, providing a bit more control as we manipulate the Delivered-To headers (and possibly other headers that JavaMail may want to change internally, such as Message-ID, Date and Mime-Version)."
