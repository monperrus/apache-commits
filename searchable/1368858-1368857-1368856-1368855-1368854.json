   "added a renderNewWidget() method to rave.js; when called as the successCallback from rave.api.rpc.addWidgetToPage() it adds the widget to the page immediately with no refresh required (see RAVE-743). Note that initWidgets() now filters its init actions to avoid re-initializing existing widgets, or trying to init widgets previously deleted in the same session."
