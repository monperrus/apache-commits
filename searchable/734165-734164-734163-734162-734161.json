   "Fixed serious bug which could cause the computer on which a failed imaging reservation occurred to be reloaded.  Added additional checks to inuse.pm to make sure a normal reservation hasn't been changed to imaging.  If imaging has begun, the inuse process exits immediately.  Created inuse.pm::_check_imaging_request to avoid redundant code.", 
   "Extended utils.pm::is_request_imaging to also check if the forimaging flag is set.", 
   "Fixed cosmetic problem in image.pm that only affects log file messages.  If the OS capture_prepare or other modularized capture subroutines failed, it was displaying a log message saying it was attempting the next stage even though it wasn't."
