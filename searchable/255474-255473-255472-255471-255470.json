   "Merging the explicitHeaderWork into the head branch.", 
   "Summary of changes:", 
   "* Support for explicit soap header parameters.", 
   "(parameters and return values that are part of the", 
   "SEI that are passed to/from headers). Includes:", 
   "* WSDD parameter inHeader and outHeader attributes", 
   "that designate a parameter as being passed in/out", 
   "of a header.", 
   "* WSDD operation returnHeader attribute to designate", 
   "that a return value is passed back in a header.", 
   "* Analagous changes to the org.apache.axis.description classes.", 
   "* Changed the emitter to generate the new attributes in deploy.wsdd.", 
   "* Changes to the emitter to generate stubs that pass", 
   "parameters in headers and expect return values from headers.", 
   "* Minor changes to the Call api to support the stub changes.", 
   "* Changes to RPCElement/RPCHandler to deserialize parameters", 
   "from headers.", 
   "* Changes to RPCProvider (and new RPCHeaderParam class) to", 
   "serialize parameters/return values in headers.", 
   "* Added support for the Use enumeration (comparable to the Style", 
   "enumeration).  This was necessary to support rpc/literal.", 
   "* Added a Use enumeration.  Added notes to the Style enumeration", 
   "to describe the combinations of Use/Style.", 
   "* The WSDD service now has a \"use\" attribute.  The default", 
   "setting for use depends on the \"style\" setting.  The default", 
   "is use=encoded for style=rpc; otherwise the default is use=literal.", 
   "* Changed the emitter to generate the use attribute in deploy.wsdd.", 
   "* Changed the WSDD files, description classes and other classes to", 
   "pass around the Use information.  (Every place that queried/manipulated", 
   "Style now does the same with Use.)", 
   "* Changed the runtime to use the Use attribute during serialization/deserialization", 
   "as appropriate.", 
   "* Changed the emitter to use Use/Style instead of hard-coded integer constants.",
