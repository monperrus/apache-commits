   "Cleaned up message renderer code and consolidated rendering logic for server-side and client-side validation into single block.  Removed duplicate spans for client-side validation, so issues with duplicate messages should be resolved.  Also cleaned up default style for messages to remove the use of p_OraDisplayBlock from OraInlineInfoText style, so strange layout behavior should be resolve in IE."
