   "- Changed the following:", 
   "o An empty list is not an exception. it is valid to have an empty list.", 
   "a new flag INFO_EMPTY_LIST_OBJECT has been added to the class to", 
   "indicate this. an exception is not thrown.", 
   "o A check is made in render() to see if we had an empty list.",

   "to keep multiple threads from running init().", 
   "o Localized the listObject to the render to prevent any unforseen",
