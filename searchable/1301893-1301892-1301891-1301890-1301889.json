   "Bug fix back ported from trunk r1300463. For more details please refer discussion done on developer mailing list with subject line 'svn commit: r1300463 [1/3] - in /ofbiz/trunk: applications/accounting/src/org/ofbiz/accounting/finaccount/ applications/accounting/src/org/ofbiz/accounting/invoice/ applications/accounting/src/org/ofbiz/accounting/payment/ applications/accountin' Log Message from trunk:On production systems you can't suppress Debug.log( message by the use of debug.properties file. It is always good to use Debug.* statements that are having log level setup in debug.properties file. The real problem comes with Debug.log( statement when you are printing any list or map object that contains so many records(or data) in it. Here I am changing all the occurrence of Debug.log( with Debug.logInfo(, Debug.logError( or Debug.logWarning( so that we can have better control of Debug.* statements on production system. :-)"
