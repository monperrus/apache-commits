   "Enhancement: all background threads now subclass a new class called WikiBackgroundThread which will gracefully shut themselves down when they hear a 'wiki shutdown' event. These threads are, at present: WikiSession.SessionMonitor, PageManager.LockReaper, RSSThread, and LuceneSearchProvider.LuceneUpdater. These threads are NO LONGER daemon threads, which means they won't stay in memory when the wiki webapp is removed.",

   "Enhancement: Added protected method shutdown() to WikiEngine that is triggered by WikiServlet catching webapp destroy() events. Shutdown()  fires a WikiEngineEvent called 'shutdown' to all listeners, which at  present includes all WikiBackgroundThreads. New class added:  WikiEngineEvent. To catch container events, WikiServlet was changed in web.xml to load at startup. This is a dirty hack, but not too dirty."
