   "Simple types of the form:", 
   "<simpleType name=\"simple\">", 
   "<restriction base=\"xsd:string\" />",

   "Solution:", 
   "---------", 
   "The solution is to generate bean classes (via JavaComplexTypeWriter)", 
   "for the simpleType constructs.", 
   "The emitted beans will be the same style as the classes emitted for", 
   "complexType constructs with simpleContent (which is the reason", 
   "why JavaComplexTypeWriter is used).", 
   "In the future, these simpleType emitted classes will be useful", 
   "for implementing facet restriction code.", 
   "Details:", 
   "--------", 
   "1) Changed the SchemaUtils:getComplexElementDeclarations to", 
   "getContainedElementDeclarations since it is used to", 
   "get the \"value\" element for a simpleType.", 
   "The change also makes the reference count processing and", 
   "nested processing the same for simpleTypes and complexTypes", 
   "...a good thing.", 
   "2) Made minor changes to JavaComplexTypeWriter.  (The", 
   "name of this class should be changed to JavaBeanWriter.)", 
   "3) Minor changes to the SymbolTable processing to", 
   "remove the old processing of simpleTypes.",
