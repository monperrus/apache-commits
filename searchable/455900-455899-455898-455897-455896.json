   "Reorganized a bit.  We need to bring people into Wicket on the web site in baby steps.  The Examples link tends to make people think they're going to have to do a bunch of stuff to see anything.  So I changed the name to \"QuickTour\" and then created a separate examples page where we should describe step by step how to run the examples from ground zero.  Finally, I created a Download page which explains what each wicket sub-project is and what is in it.  There's a lot more work to do, but this seems like a good start.  We can argue the fine points if I missed something."
