   "Add true states support to GridItemRenderer. Added the hovered property that was missing from IGridItemRenderer, and implemented it in GridItemRenderer and DefaultGridItemRenderer. GridLayout now also sets the hovered property correctly in initializeItemRenderer(). GridItemRenderer now sets the state correctly when the properties are changed. For now, we disable transitions at all times between states until Grid can support it.",
