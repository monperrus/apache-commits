   "Fix for cluster_test problems: a) When not started from within test dir, qpidd is not found, and a process cascade results in which each forked process continues and runs all tests after its own instead of terminating; b) Hard-coded paths and names of libs, which have been moved into Makefile.am; c) Some tests use ScopedSuppressLogging, these tests are modified so the scope of the logging suppression does not include the broker/cluster startup."
