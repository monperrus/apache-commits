   "Test Plan: Currently I am testing by editing the metrics configuration file to export into a file and reading the metrics there (they should be prefixed by a column family name). The better way to test is on a dev cluster using JMX, although hopefully both should yield the same information. Consistency checks should be made that, ie the number of files for each column family adds up to the total. If discrepancies are found they should be investigated.", 
   "Perhaps some performance tests should be done, and or the performance ramifications of the code should be thought about more thoroughly.", 
   "Revert Plan: Just revert the codebase and restart.",
