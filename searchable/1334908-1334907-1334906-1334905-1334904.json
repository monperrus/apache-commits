   "-Changes to handle logical data(or logical caches)", 
   "- While a cursor is built or ReadWrite txn is in progress, the thread hold a shared lock. If it needs to change logical data derived from transactional data, it escalates its lock to exclusive lock. This escalation might throw TxnConflictException", 
   "- Multiple locks to manage different caches is replaced with one single lock at the txn manager layer.", 
   "- If a txn fails (conflict or any other exception) all logical caches are rebuilt from underlying transactionally managed data. Here many optimizations are possible.", 
   "-Added TxnConflictIT to MigratedStockCoreISuite(more basic multithreaded tests would be good)", 
   "This completes the forward going changes in the transactional layer. Tests are passing. This would be a good checkpoint."
