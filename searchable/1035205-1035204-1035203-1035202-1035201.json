   "LUCENE-2757, LUCENE-2690: Add test for BQ.maxClauseCount checking. Also the original test was missing duplicate terms in the MultiReader case, added this.", 
   "This also fixes a \"bug\" in the TooManyClauses exception which can be seen in failing tests: The message may not contain the value of maxClauses at the time the exception was thrown. Tests have exactly this problem, because they print the message when the default is already restored."
