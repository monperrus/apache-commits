   "Use maven-failsafe-plugin to run the tests, as this plugin is bound to the \"integration-test\" phase which comes after the \"package\" phase. This is what commons-logging needs for most of its tests.", 
   "The normal \"test\" phase is handled by maven-surefire-plugin. We \"disable\" that by only running a single test class, one that can be run at the \"test\" phase. This a hack. To do it the Maven way would mean renaming all integration test source files. But, because we still have an Ant build to maintain I prefer to make as few changes as possible."
