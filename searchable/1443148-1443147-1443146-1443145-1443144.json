   "Enhances the Http(s) and ws(s) transport Servers such that they can update the connectUri after starting so that test cases can use the any port option on their URI like \"localhost:0\" and get the connection string after the BrokerService is started.  This will allow most of those test cases to be updated so that they don't fail because the hard coded port is already bound."
