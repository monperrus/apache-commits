   "Fixing up Weblogger and Planet integration some more.  This commit ...", 
   "1. updated roller-planet-business.jar used by Weblogger app.", 
   "2. cleans up the sql scripts a bit more to include the latest tables from the Planet project.", 
   "3. fixes up the initialization process to better handle Planet initialization when Weblogger is starting up.", 
   "4. makes some changes for upgrading users to conform to the way the Planet codebase works.  The old planet code allowed for querying a list of entries based on the union of multiple groups, but there is really no reason for that and so it's not allowed in the current Planet code.  In specific, Weblogger used to maintain 2 groups ('all' and 'external') and query for their entries together, but instead those 2 groups have been merged as part of the 4.0 upgrade process now."
