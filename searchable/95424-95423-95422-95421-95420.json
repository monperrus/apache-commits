   "Fix the case where if there is no ErrorDocument specified for an error,", 
   "the error would be sent to the client *twice* because both the filter", 
   "and the core would trigger error responses.", 
   "The problem is that the filters have already handled some errors (say 413)", 
   "and due to the ap_get_client_block API, the error was morphed into 400.", 
   "Therefore, ap_discard_request_body must use brigades directly rather than", 
   "the ap_get_client_block API so that any potential errors are not dropped.", 
   "The special value AP_FILTER_ERROR indicates that the lower level has", 
   "already dealt with this problem (ap_die() will realize this).  Otherwise,", 
   "we'll error with HTTP_BAD_REQUEST and ap_die() will take it from there.", 
   "This also prevents needless memory copies when we are just going to", 
   "discard it anyway.", 
   "Thanks to Cliff Woolley who found this wacky problem."
