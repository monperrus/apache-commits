   "Updated VMware code which copies and moves/renames virtual disks. If the name of the vmdk had to be shortened, the target vmdk is now renamed back to the originally requested name by the move_vmdk subroutine. Changed the copy_virtual_disk and move_virtual_disk subroutines in vSphere_SDK.pm to return a string containing the resulting vmdk file path. This is used by the caller to determine if the name had to be changed.", 
   "Updated VMware.pm::does_image_exist to search for both a vmdk named after the original image name as well as the shortened name. Moved _clean_vm_name from vSphere_SDK.pm to VMware.pm so it can be called from does_image_exist. This fixes issues in environments where images with the different names exist in different datastores/repositories."
