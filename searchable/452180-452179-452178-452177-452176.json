   "minor refactor so that the saxon and file components can reuse more logic from the ProviderEndpoint - making it easier for derived endpoints to just implement specific methods (rather like the default methods on the Servlet classes to allow you to overload a GET or POST etc). Also added a test case for servicemix-file which shows the file marshaler / xpath expressions being used"
