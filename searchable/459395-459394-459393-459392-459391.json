   "Made interface registration in Initializer explicit and explained why it is there.  In reality, I think custom components outside the core would want to self-register in the appropriate de-serialization method and we might want to do that to our core components eventually since they serve as an example to others, but this will work and is sufficient for now.", 
   "The old implementation which simply \"touched' the interface object by assigning it to a local Object variable was a construct that any good optimizing compiler would legitimately complain about.  The explicit registration is self-documenting and with the comment, nobody can mistake what is going on."
