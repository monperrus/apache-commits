   "Fixed a few issues with reserved.pm and inuse.pm. The parent reserved may have exited before all child reservations had exited. Added a check to make sure computerloadlog reserved entry exists for all children before parent exits. Also added check to make sure reservation wasn't deleted or any of the child reserved processes failed.",
