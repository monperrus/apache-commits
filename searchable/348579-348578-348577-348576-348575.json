   "DERBY-706 Improve testing and increase code coverage for Network Server classes", 
   "Contributed by Deepa Remesh", 
   "This patch adds some tests for network server and re-arranges/removes some internal methods which are not used.", 
   "Details of patch are: * derbynet/getCurrentProperties.java - Added tests for NetworkServerControl.logConnections and setTraceDirectory methods. Modified getCurrentProperties_sed.properties to use a substitute instead of delete for traceDirectory. * derbynet/testProperties.java - Added some more command line tests. * derbynet/timeslice.java and maxthreads.java - Added tests for invalid values. * derbynet/runtimeinfo.java and sysinfo.java - Added test to call methods in NetworkServer control * Modified master files. * DRDAResultSet.java - removed unused constructor \"DRDAResultSet(ResultSet rs)\" * DRDAStatement.java - Changed getNumRsCols() to use getRsDRDATypes() instead of directly calling DRDAResultSet method. Removed isProcedure() method which is not used. Changed getResultSetCursorName() to call drdaRs.getResultSetCursorName() which handles case for null result set. * NetworkServerControlImpl.java - Removed methods for connection pooling which is not implemented and not used. With this patch, I ran derbyall with Sun JDK 1.4.2. No failures."
