   "Fixed bug with createSurveyResponse in a way that allows numeric IDs; there is a special problem here because variable names are set and then later used in an expression, which is why most of these expressions are working fine but these are not; also found a bug in updateSurvey with a variable name that was wrong causing updates not to work and fixed that"
