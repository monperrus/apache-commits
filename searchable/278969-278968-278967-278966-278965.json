   "I'll commit this patch because it improves the current situation but I'm not happy with the current state of Java2DRenderer.renderSVGDocument(). Creating inverse transformation matrices is surely not the right way to do this. The matrix should be saved and restored instead.", 
   "Furthermore, renderSVGDocument should be extracted into a Java2DSVGHandler like it is done for the other renderers."
