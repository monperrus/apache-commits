   "A patch from Sascha Rodekamp \"Additional parameter for FreeMarker to tell if it should load ftl files from cache or not\" (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-3970) - OFBIZ-3970", 
   "This patch allows you to tell FreeMarker if it should load the ftl files from cache or not as extension for the method description. If you have a few screens which shouldn't use the cache you can configure them separately. The use case is loading content with templates which are stored in the DB and can be modified during the runtime (CMS)."
