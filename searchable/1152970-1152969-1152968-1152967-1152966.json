This corresponds to https://github.com/kafka-dev/kafka/commit/709afe4ec75489bc00a44335de8821fa726bb97e except that git specific files have been removed and code has been put into trunk/branches/site/etc. This is just a copy of master, branches and history are not being converted since we can't find a good tool for it."
