   "Updated OS.pm::update_public_ip_address to set the public IP address retrieved from the OS in the Datastructure object. This returns the correct value to future callers of get_computer_ip_address.", 
   "Updated new.pm::reserve_computer to call get_computer_ip_address after update_public_ip_address is called. This causes the code to use the correct, updated IP instead of an old value stored in the database.", 
   "VCL-564", 
   "Added OS.pm::get_tools_file_paths. This is used to determine which files under the tools directory on the management node apply to the reservation image. Also added OS.pm::get_file_checksum. This is used to determine whether or a file on the management node is identical to a file on the computer being loaded. If they differ, the file on the computer is replaced.", 
   "Added optional concatenate argument to OS.pm::create_text_file. By default the text file is overwritten. This argument is used by the run_script subroutines when the logfile is written to.", 
   "Updated Windows.pm::run_scripts to call OS.pm::get_tools_file_paths.", 
   "VCL-572", 
   "Added subroutines to Windows.pm: install_updates, get_installed_updates, install_exe_update, and install_msu_update.", 
   "Moved call to get_imagemeta_postoption from the beginning of Windows.pm::post_load to the actual check that determines if the computer needs to be rebooted. This allows any of the subroutines prior to that point to set the reboot flag.", 
   "VCL-565", 
   "Changed call in OS.pm::manage_server_access which was directly referencing $ENV{management_node_info} to use $self->data.", 
   "Other", 
   "Removed call to utils.pm::setstaticaddress in OS.pm::update_public_ip_address. This subroutine was removed.", 
   "Added check to make sure the interface name was retrieved in OS.pm: get_private_network_configuration, get_public_network_configuration", 
   "Moved copy_file_to and find_files from Linux.pm to OS.pm since they can be used by other OS's.", 
   "Updated Linux.pm::logoff_user to check for an \"invalid user name\" error in the output."
