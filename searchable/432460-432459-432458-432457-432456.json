   "my first pass through with project grouping which required a fair amount of changes to -api -core -store to support the concepts already in place in the -model.  the -webapp parts are basically working, the triggered builds are still building everything across the board but support for fixing that is in place to be wired in.  Whole slew of changes but brett and jason were both cool with my getting this big commit out of the way so I could continue on the same path without this looming."
