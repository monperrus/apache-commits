   "RadialGradient and GradientEntry bug fixes", 
   "SDK-17745 - MXML application with multiple identical gradient fills doesn't render correctly", 
   "RadialGradient now takes into account the x/y position of the graphic element's bounds.", 
   "SDK-17652 - AI import; non-default angle and location of gradients are not retained on import of .ai or .fxg.", 
   "RadialGradient now rotates as expected. Previously, we set rotation using the Matrix.createGradientBox function. But this only rotate the gradients themselves and not the shape of the gradient as defined by scaleX and scaleY. Instead, we need to translate the center of the gradient to 0,0, rotate it, and then translate it back to the original location.", 
   "SDK-17654 - GradientEntry ratio behavior is inconsistent between MXML and ActionScript", 
   "Changed the default value for the ratio parameter in the GradientEntry constructor from -1 to NaN. GradientEntry was probably written before we had support for NaN in the language.", 
   "Added a couple of comments and removed some dead code.",
