   "RegExAnnotationFacetFactory and MaskAnnotationFacetFactory now both install a TitleFacet with their own implementation of rendering a title.  The TitleFacet#titleWithMask has therefore been removed (plus corresponding deprecated method in the Parser interface).  NB: the actual implementation of TitleFacetBasedOnMask#titleString actually just delegates to the underlying title implementation because it's not clear (to me, at least) exactly how the mask and an existing title are meant to interact."
