   "I discovered while using trunk demo that getServerTimestampAsLong is not enough. Because Javascript always creates the dates without taking into account the TimeZone. I mean there are OOTB no ways to do otherwise and date.format.js does not help. This makes sense from a HTTP client perspective, but nowadays it's really aging with Ajax, etc.", 
   "Fortunately there is a miraculous script which helps much: date.timezone.js. I have introduced it with a getServerTimeZone service. I tested locally by setting another timezone on another machine and it worked. I will now test it on trunk, I don't expect any issues", 
   "I also cleaned the NOTICE for famfamfam"
