   "Important Note: Since Codewarrior 8 at long last supports HFS+ long file names, these projects now directly reference the src/xercesc files instead of the previously shortened file names in the MacSrc directory. With CodeWarrior 8 and these projects it is no longer necessary to run the perl script ShortenNames.pl to generate that MacSrc directory."
