   "Fix for FTPSERVER-241 where the JVM leaks file handles when using the SSLServerSocket (http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6764972). While this bugs seems to be fixed in 1.6u12, we should fix it for users of other JVMs. Using the workaround described here http://www.nabble.com/-security-dev-00402-:-Re:-NullPointerException-at%09sun.security.ssl.OutputRecord.writeBuffer-td20492154.html. It's based on using a wrapper SSLSocket rather than creating an SSLServerSocket. Using this, the number of used file handles seems to be consistent and low when debugged using lsof -p <the PID> | grep sock | wc -l"
