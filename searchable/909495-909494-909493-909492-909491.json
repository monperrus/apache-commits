   "Updated the proxy service code to handle POST requests and BASIC AUTH (Thanks to Henning Eriksson for the patch). This fixes WOOKIE-116. Also made some changes to make the servlet easier to run tests against (such as using standard HTTP error codes rather than custom error messages), and added some test cases."
