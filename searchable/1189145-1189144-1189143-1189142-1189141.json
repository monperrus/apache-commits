   "TOMEE-42 TOMEE-43 adding a custom Loader to the standardcontext to be able to override the classloader used. In the tomcat deployement the classloader used by openejb is the stadnardcontext one so it is ok but in TomEE container (used by arquillian, DeployerEjb, tomee-embedded and TomEE EJBContainer) the classloader used is a classloader created by OpenEJB. So Class.isAssignable returns false when Foo.class.isAssignable(Foo.class) is called because classloaders are differents. - still to validate"
