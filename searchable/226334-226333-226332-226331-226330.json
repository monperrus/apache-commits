   "Adding resolved flag to Artifact.", 
   "This is done to counter the possibility that an artifact's file is set without the artifact actually being resolved, as in the case where the artifact is a snapshot version, but no snapshot-enabled repositories exist (think plugin resolution). This also has the beneficial side-effect of providing a more intuitive method of checking whether an artifact has been resolved (rather than artifact.getFile() != null)."
