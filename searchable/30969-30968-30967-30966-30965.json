   "Modify the SMTPOutputLogTarget so it is not possible to have it send batched groups of log events in a single message.  This was possible before, but the message would never be sent until a predetermined number of messages had arrived.  These changes make it possible to set a timeout where the message will be sent if no more log events are received within a specified time period.", 
   "In other words, it is great at keeping groups of messages together while at the same time making sure they are delivered in a timely fashion."
