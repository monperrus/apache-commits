   "[JSPWIKI-304] Changed all Workflow signatures so that all attribute values are now Serializable. This has required some minor changes to WikiContext get/setAttribute, such that these must also be Serializable too. In practice this is not a problem, because all attributes passed to WikiContext were always Strings anyway. The net effect of this change is that we can now make workflows persistent across engine restarts! (Coming later...)"
