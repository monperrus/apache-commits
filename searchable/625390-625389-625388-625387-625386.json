   "Enhancement: SessionsPlugin receives parameter 'property' to specify what session information should be returned. If set to 'users', plugin returns the list of current users. If omitted, it returns the number of active sessions. Thus, [{INSERT SessionsPlugin property=users}] will actually print the names of current users -- neat!"

   "Enhancement: all background threads now subclass a new class called WikiBackgroundThread which will gracefully shut themselves down when they hear a 'wiki shutdown' event. These threads are, at present: WikiSession.SessionMonitor, PageManager.LockReaper, RSSThread, and LuceneSearchProvider.LuceneUpdater. These threads are NO LONGER daemon threads, which means they won't stay in memory when the wiki webapp is removed."
