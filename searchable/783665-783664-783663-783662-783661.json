   "TUSCANY-3082 TUSCANY-3090 - Remove references to the old EndpointReference and replace with EndpointReference2 and Endpoint2 as appropriate. You'll see that some of the changes have left more commented out code as the old EndpointReference has code to support callback/conversation function not required by OASIS. I've also disabled some itests for this reason. Note that callbacks over web services won't work yet as work on EndpointReference2 is still ongoing."
