   "QPID-3064, QPID-3157: ensure the node for a given Subscription is unlinked from the SubscriptionList at the point of removal instead of relying on the list head advancing to do so. Add 'marked node' functionality to the SubscriptionList to provide the Subscription cycling functionality to the queue, allowing the list to tidy itself up fully. Correct corner case behaviour for deleted-but-still-linked tail node in SubscriptionListIterator. Add tests."
