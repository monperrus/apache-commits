   "SYNAPSE-304: Modified the mail transport to use the message builder API. This drastically increases the number of standard test cases that are successfully passed by the transport. Note that SOAP with Attachments still doesn't work in all cases because attachments are sent with \"Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\" and mail servers don't like that (This could be fixed by using the enhancement introduced in WSCOMMONS-390)."
