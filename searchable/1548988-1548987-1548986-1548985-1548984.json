   "[HBASE-10083] Better error handling for the compound bloom filter", 
   "Summary:", 
   "When RegionServer failed to load a bloom block from HDFS due to any timeout or other reasons, it threw out the exception and disable the entire bloom filter for this HFile. This behavior does not make too much sense, especially for the compound bloom filter.", 
   "Instead of disabling the bloom filter for the entire file, it could just return a potentially false positive result (true) and keep the bloom filter available.", 
   "Test Plan: will run through all the unit tests and shadow testing for Altair.",
