   "MECLIPSE-632: This is part of partitioning user behavior for Maven support in Eclipse. No more halfway, if you want to use M2Eclipse then you import your projects using M2Eclipse. If you want to use \"mvn eclipse:eclipse\" then this structure will not be supported in M2Eclipse 1.0 and there shouldn't be any confusion to users. The M2Eclipse developers will no longer support this behavior because it's getting out of control at this point."
