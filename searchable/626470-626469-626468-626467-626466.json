   "Removed the two-argument constructor from GroupPrincipal and its associated \"wiki\" field. This interacted in a very subtle way with LocalPolicy to prevent GroupPrincipal privilege grants from being processed correctly. We concluded that this \"feature\", while intended to be used with multi-wiki environments, was fatally broken from the start. Also: many, many little fixes to remove Checkstyle issues."
