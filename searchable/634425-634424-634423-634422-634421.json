   "DERBY-3504 Fix timeout errors in management._Suite when running with classes. Was due to the spawned vm to execute the server failing as installing the policy file requires jars. Changed the decorator to add the -noSecurityManager flag if classes is being used with comments indicating if tests need a different behaviour they need to provide it.", 
   "Added a SpawnedProcess utilitly class that correctly handles the output streams written by a spawned process by having two background threads that read from the streams into a buffer. This stops the change the process hangs due to being blocked writing stdout or stderr. Used this utility class in one more location where a vm was being spawned. Ideally the spawning of a java process should be in a single utility not scattered around multple tests, separate cleanup issue."
