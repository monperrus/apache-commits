   "fixed 1417826 by disabling stateless page support since it is implemented incorrectly.", 
   "currently we assume the page is stateless if no backtracking url is asked for it using urlFor, and this makes sense. however, what we did not think about is how the page is accessed. If the page url is not bookmarkable, ie: ?path=4 and the user clicks the refresh button on the browser they will get a page expired error since the page was never put into the pagemap."
