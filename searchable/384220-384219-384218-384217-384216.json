   "minor refactor to use \"stopped\" and \"stopping\" as properties on ServiceSupport and the transport classes. Also made the TransportListener getter visible and avoided the need for protected variables in the various TransportFilter implementations (due to inlining, often getter methods are faster in hotspot than access to protected fields, plus it simplifies the code & makes it less brittle)"
