   "Introduced TemplateResolution, which forwards the user to the appropriate resource in /templates/<template>. It replaces the use of ForwardResolution in most of the ActionBeans. For example, to forward to a template JSP (\"display JSP\"), you'd do this: new TemplateResolution( \"PageInfo.jsp\" ). JSPWiki will figure out where the template JSP actually is, and forward to the correct path."
