   "Fixed problem where Windows code would take a long time to configure the firewall after the user clicks Connect. This prevented the user from Connecting on the first try. The firewall code was first retrieving the current network configuration and firewall configuration. This can take several seconds. Changed state flow so that new.pm does not update the computer state to 'reserved'. This is now handled by reserved.pm after all of the modules have been initialized including the retrieval of the firewall configuration."
