   "This will make it easier to extend to non-Sun JVMs later.", 
   "Also, adding in additional second-try at guessing that will allow procrun to recover from at least some of the common JVM installation errors.", 
   "Finally, adding in support to specify JAVA_HOME via the --Environment configuration option, so that it is possible to configure different services to use different JVM installs."
