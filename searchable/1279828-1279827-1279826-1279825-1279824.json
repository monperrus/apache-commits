   "Added code to draw an invisible rectangle to the titleDisplay object in the panel for accessibility purposes.  The panel's accessibility implementation is hooked into the panel's titleDisplay.  This causes the accessible location properties to only include the titleDisplay and not the whole panel.  Since the accessible location can not be updated in the AccImpl file for the panel itself, it needs to be corrected here.  The accessible location needs to be correct for panel to include the whole panel so screen readers can use coordinates to determine what components are inside the panel (as Flash has a flat structure otherwise).",
