   "PLUTO-523: Further abstractions of the Pluto SPI to support embedding in and extending by other portals", 
   "See: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PLUTO-523?focusedCommentId=12667826#action_12667826", 
   "- adding new PortletContainer enum Method type defining the specific supported container methods (.e.g. render/resource/action/admin/load)", 
   "- recording current invoked Method enum value in ContainerInvocation so it can be evaluated/used within container processing logic", 
   "- fixing the PortletRequestDispatcher.forward method to actually call (servlet) rd.forward instead of \"faking\" it through an rd.include", 
   "- adjusting DefaultPortletInvokerService to use forwards for PortletContainer.Method.RESOURCE", 
   "- adding get/set properties methods to PortletURLProvider as formally required by the spec (no real implementation needed: this is intended for \"vendor\" specific properties handling)", 
   "- replacing the RequestPropertyProvider (which internal implementation was really, really messy and broken in many ways) by more generic PropertyManager (very similar to old Pluto 1.1.x PropertyManager actually).", 
   "- PropertyManager.setProperty (response headers) will write them to the servlet.response when PortletContainer.Method.RESOURCE, setProperty(Cookie) will now always be written out"
