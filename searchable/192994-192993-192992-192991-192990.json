   "* Refactor IFieldTable and Validators members to create a list of \"Processors\" that convert and format fields. Each field can specify a Processor in the FieldTable. The fields Processor is utilized when we need to covert or format the value. The notion of a Processor replaces declaring the DataType for a field. We can have standard Processors for the usual DataTypes, but a Processor can be used to do anything needed with a field, including inserting and stripping punctuation (telephone numbers).", 
   "* Right now, the  Processors are in the Validator namespace, but that will change in a future commit. Processors have the effect of validating a data type, but we would still need Validators to test the range of values within a data type, and so forth."
