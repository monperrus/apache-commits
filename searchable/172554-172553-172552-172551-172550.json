   "There is one MAJOR problem with the use of libwww and the patches", 
   "below, which someone with knowledge of libwww filters etc. might want", 
   "to look into. Default behavior for content-type text/xml is to consume",

   "files with content-type text/html will actually reach the xerces-c",

   "file will throw an exception stating \"The main XML document cannot be", 
   "empty\" (correct in a xerces point of view since if you enable debug", 
   "build you will see that libwww \"eats\" all text/xml).",
