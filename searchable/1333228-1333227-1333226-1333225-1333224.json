   "AXIOM-399: Also support creation of OMSourcedElements with unknown prefix (but known local name and namespace URI) through the OMFactory API. This provides a more consistent alternative to AXIOM-334. In fact, with the \"lossy prefix\" feature introduced by AXIOM-334, some part of the knowledge (the local name and namespace URI) is provided through the OMFactory API while another piece of information (the fact that the prefix is unknown) is provided through a property set on the OMDataSource. This is not very consistent."
