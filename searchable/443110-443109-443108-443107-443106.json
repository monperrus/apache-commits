   "Replaced storeAll/toStore with service calls in createInvoiceForOrder.  Created a new service for it to use.  Fixes bugs where downstream operations in the logic requires upstream objects to be created first.  Test case: User captures a payment for a CC then generates invoice via shipment system.  Expected outcome is that payment is applied to invoice and if fulfilled, invoice is marked as paid."
