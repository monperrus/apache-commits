   "Several changes:", 
   "* Fix the chain \"forward-reference\" problem by introducing two new", 
   "Suppliers which keep lists of the names of the chain elements for", 
   "simple and targeted chains, then build the actual chain objects when", 
   "getHandler() is called.", 
   "* Remove the restriction that TargetedChain must use Chains as the", 
   "request and response handlers.", 
   "* Change \"input\"->\"request\" and \"output\"->\"response\" in the deployment", 
   "XML for targeted chains / services.", 
   "* Add a setEngine() method to SOAPService, which handles maintaining", 
   "the TypeMappingRegistry relationship for us, and might do other stuff", 
   "in the future.", 
   "* Fix potential ClassCastException in SimpleChain.getHandlers()", 
   "* Increase the Debug level on the supplier messages to avoid overloading", 
   "the log.", 
   "* Add main() to the RPC tests for individual running from the command line,", 
   "and add a serialized RPC test which uses a custom type mapping.", 
   "Limitations with the \"forward-reference\" solution:", 
   "* We rely on the registry being passed into Admin being a SupplierRegistry.", 
   "Right now, this is a good bet, but the design for how this really works", 
   "wants to be cleaned up, which goes along with a larger conversation", 
   "about where the various pieces of deployments live (i.e. what's the", 
   "relationship between engine registries, XML/WSDD files, and Handlers)."
