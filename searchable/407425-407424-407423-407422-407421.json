   "1) External document digester did not process custom actions (fix introduces a backwards incompatible change). Documentation and test cases have been updated. A wiki page has been created to note such changes as we move towards the first RC.", 
   "SCXML-8", 
   "2) Moved the post document-parsing model updation (and checking) bits to a io package scoped ModelUpdater class", 
   "3) Added some more utility methods to SCXMLTestHelper and SCXMLDigester", 
   "4) Added examples and test cases of shallow and deep history, and history defaults", 
   "5) SCXMLDigester's parsing methods now throw a ModelException (backwards incompatible change). This is one of the ways to provide better error reporting about model errors introduced by reading in a state machine from flawed SCXML documents."
