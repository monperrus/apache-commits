   "Basic refactored AC prototype. You can now GRANT or DENY credentials on a url basis. This is integrated into the current implementation. We extend the *.acml files with an @method attribute to define whether or not a certain accreditable can have a role. Till now I did not cleaned/verify that some method can be romved due to this changes. The sitetree usecase AC... needs an update and the whole stuff more testing. Please do in lenya-trunk/src: svn switch https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lenya/sandbox/ac-restricted-1.4-src", 
   "if you are keen to test and play around. Try to change the *acml in the build (e.g. with vim) and see the effect after reload."
