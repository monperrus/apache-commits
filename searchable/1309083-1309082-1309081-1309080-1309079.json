   "A couple more enhancements to HttpQuery", 
   "- Adds a getResponseCode() property so code that uses the class directly can retrieve the response code after a request has been made", 
   "- Fixes an error handling issue where execCommon() would re-wrap a QueryExceptionHTTP as a QueryExceptionHTTP because it was catching JenaException (which QueryExceptionHTTP is descended from) and the re-wrapping was hiding the error details from the consumer of the exception (e.g. the response code)"
