   "First of 2-parts to make Flex Graphics be Flash Player 10 DrawingAPI-2 compliant.", 
   "This checkin builds upon the code shared between the Degrafa team and the Flex team, where a graphicsPath object is used to generate a Path's shape data. Paths delegate to their individual segment classes to generate shape data, this data is coalesced in a new graphicsPath object and then rendered.", 
   "Part 2 will come shortly. This will include support for generating DAPI-2 commands for fills, strokes and all graphic elements.", 
   "With this check-in Paths now support the winding property, new in DAPI-2.", 
   "Much thanks to the Degrafa team for their initial coding contributions!",

This change removes duplicate names from the Flex 4 framework to avoid class name overlapping with the old framework code.
