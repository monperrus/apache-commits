   "ARIES-825: Multiple changes.", 
   "(1) Added AriesSubsystem-Parents header in support of persistence.", 
   "(2) Added ReferenceCountDirective in support of persistence. Indicates whether or not the parent/child relationship should result in an incremented reference count. For example, the reference count should not be incremented if the child was provisioned as a dependency.", 
   "(3) Feature now expose all of the capabilities, except osgi.identity, and requirements of their content resources at the subsystem resource level. Applications expose requirements as computed in the subsystem manifest. Composites expose capabilities and requirements as provided in the subsystem manifest.", 
   "(4) Removed boolean transitive flag from ResourceInstaller as this can be computed without the flag.", 
   "(5) Fixed issue in BundleResourceUninstaller where stale resource references and constituents were being retained.", 
   "(6) Fixed issue in PreferredProviderRepository where capability validation relied on object identity.", 
   "(7) Fixed issue where incorrect resource reference and active use counts were being maintained.", 
   "(8) Fixed issue with subsystem state check in StopAction.", 
   "(9) Fixed issue in SubsystemResourceUninstaller where the persistent directory would not be deleted if an error had occurred.", 
   "(10) Fixed issue in Subsystems where root subsystem service was being published before SubsystemGraph had been initialized.", 
   "(11) Fixed issue in Subsystems where persisted subsystems other than root were not being installed.", 
   "(12) Fixed issue in SystemRepository where subsystem capabilities were not being taken into account.", 
   "(13) Fixed issue with subsystem state check in UninstallAction."
