   "Added utils.pm::determine_remote_connection_target. This get passed an IP address or hostname of a target to connect to. It attempts to determine which to use to connect. The preference is now to use the private IP address. If this is not populated in the database, it attempts to resolve the hostname and use the resolved IP address. If all else fails, the original argument is returned.", 
   "Added utils.pm::get_computer_current_private_ip_address. This retrieves the current privateIPaddress from the database.", 
   "Updated utils.pm::nmap_port, run_ssh_command, and run_scp_command to use the value returned from determine_remote_connection_target.", 
   "Updated DataStructure.pm::get_computer_private_ip_address to check the value in the database. The database value is authoritative. DataStructure.pm will get the correct value if updated outside of DataStructure.pm.", 
   "Updated OS.pm::execute_new to call determine_remote_connection_target and use the result to make the remote connection."
