   "OAK-2682 : critical buglet fix : when the time difference is too large send an *AssertionError*, not an IllegalStateException which will be caught by the outer try and nothing other than a simple WARN happens. This way the DocumentNodeStore service will not properly be activated/available, hence the repository cannot start, hence the user will probably get a 503 - and that's what should happen"
