   "With OFBIZ-5702 - \"Wrong timeFormat of datetimepicker causes hours represented as 12 not 24\", I wrongly committed changes in R12 and R11 branches.", 
   "Though I thought I checked the jquery-ui-timepicker-addon version in R12 and R11, I obviously did it wrong. The jquery-ui-timepicker-addon version are there older (0.9.7 and 0.9.6 respectively) and don't contain the 24 hours format handling. So the changes in R12.04 r1616276 and R11.04 r1616281 were wrong. This reverts r1616276"
