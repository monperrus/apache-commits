   "Made layout constraint animation actually work. Animating constraints (left, right, etc.) with the Animate effect worked previously, but only if the animation values were explicitly specified or, in a transition, if both states had valid values for the constraint. But if you attempted to run a transition animating \"left\" where the constraint was cleared in either state, the animation would fail.", 
   "The fix checks for invalid values in the states and, when they occur, animates other related properties instead, or in addition. For example, an animation on \"left\" may turn into an animation on \"x\".",

   "Fix to allow Animate to automatically handle changes in styles during transitions. This same logic already works for properties (e.g., if you specify different values for x in states and run Animate with a SimpleMotionPath with property=\"x\" then it will automatically determine the from/to values to animate for x). But we needed to add an override for getRelevantStyles() for Animate to advertise the possible styles to pick up changes for so that the transitions array would be populated accordingly.",
