   "- UIComponents, GraphicElements's matrix used for layout calculations, and set by the parent layouts, is now decoupled from the actual layout used by the flash player for rendering.", 
   "- Both UIComponents an d GraphicElements can be handed a TransformOffset object. The transformOffset allows developers to specify adjustments to the transform as defined by the compoennts parent layout.", 
   "- 3D properties on components and graphic elements are now supported.  Setting a 3D property or a 3D matrix on a component or element will affect it visually, but the 2D layouts will continue to lay out as though only the 2D portion of their layout is applied.", 
   "- transformX,Y,Z now fully supported on components and elements.  For layouts that don't try and set the post transform bounds (i.e., absolute layout without constraints), the layout scale and rotation will be centered on this point.  The offset transform will also be centered around this point.", 
   "- layering is now decoupled from item order.  By default, components now render in order based on the value of their 'layer' property.  All components' layers default to 0.  components with the same layer render in the order they appear in their parent group's item list.", 
   "- setting transform.matrix on UIComponent is now supported, and is roughly the same as setting the convenience layout properties on the component.",
