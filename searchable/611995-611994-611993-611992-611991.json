   "The sample container now has toggles for cajoling a gadget and for using the cache. These add parameters to the gadget url used in the iframe. These url parameters are not respected by the shindig server yet.. so the checkboxes won't actually do anything for a little bit. I also changed the default gadget spec url to be something non-existent. The previous url had a confusing gadget in it. This is temporary, I will find some good sample gadgets to check in so that we can have a sensible default."
