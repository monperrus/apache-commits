   "Flex now requires CSS Style declarations to declare @namespace rules and disambiguate between halo and spark components using CSS 3 namespace prefixes on type selectors. At compile time, this namespace information will be used to map type names to qualified ActionScript class names. At runtime, type selectors are matched on qualified ActionScript class name (for example mx.controls.Button rather than just Button). Flex 3 applications must be compiled with -compatibility-version=3.0.0 to get unqualified CSS type selector behavior.",
