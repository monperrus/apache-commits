   "Updated getPasswordEncoder() to swallow (instead of throw) exceptions and log an error when it fails to instantiate the specified encoder in the model.  This allows the modeler to continue loading the model, even with an invalid encoder specified.  In an application, it will fail to connect to the database and when the user looks at the logs they'll see the missing/invalid password enocder as an error."
