   "Added a new class ModelWidgetAction which will serve to replace the duplicate classes ModelScreenAction, ModelFormAction and ModelMenuAction.  This class is virtually a direct copy of ModelScreenAction and its subclasses.  I'll work over the weekend to switch the existing classes to extend from ModelWidgetAction, remove their methods and then deprecate the shells that are left behind."
