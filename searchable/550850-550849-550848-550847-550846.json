   "Added ext-test data reader for ext data files that are used for testing only and not for production; the main reason for using this instead of demo is that it is often necessary for custom installations to make sure the tests will run without the demo data which is not generally used in production; so, production gets extseed (seed, ext) and pre-production testing gets exttest (seed, ext, ext-test)"
