   "[WSS-86][WSS-87] - Fix for \"CryptoBase.splitAndTrim does not take into account the format of a DN constructed by different providers\"", 
   "- Applied (some) of the patch attached to WSS-86", 
   "- Note that this change does not work with JDK 1.3, as X500Principal didn't exist before 1.4. Given that our code hasn't compiled with JDK 1.3 for a few years, I think this is ok though."
