   "[MNG-3600] reverted the defaults for deployment. In 2.0.x, they didn't work due to bugs in the Wagon implementation using Jsch and were hit and miss depending on existing permissions in scpexe. These were resolved in 2.1.0-M1, however the use of defaults prevents the user setting it up in the environment itself (eg using umasks), and problems with file modes causing errors when they didn't need to be set. In conjunction, more deployment has moved to HTTP reducing the impact. This is best left at \"system default\" and the way to configure it documented (as it is on the site)"
