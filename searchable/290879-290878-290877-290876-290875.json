   "Log4net is capable of outputting extended debug information about where the current message was generated: class name, method name, file, line, etc. Log4net assumes that the location information should be gathered relative to where log4net.ILog.Debug() was called. In IBatisNet, log4net.ILog.Debug() is called in IBatisNet.Common.Logging.Impl.Log4NetLogger. This means that the location information will indicate that IBatisNet.Common.Logging.Impl.Log4NetLogger always made the call to log4net.ILog.Debug(). We need to know where IBatisNet.Common.Logging.ILog.Debug() was called. To do this we need to use the log4net.ILog.Logger.Log method and pass in a Type telling log4net where in the stack to begin looking for location information."
