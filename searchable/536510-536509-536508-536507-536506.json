   "QPID-25 TimeToLive Basic implementation.", 
   "Messages are not automatically purged rather they are checked as they are selected for delivery. If they have expired they are dequeued.",

   "AMQMessage - Caches the _expiration time for internal use, adjusted for broker time. This leaves message headers unchanged so receiving client can see actual value requested by producer.", 
   "ConcurrentSelectorDeliveryManager - Updated to check for expired messages when getNextMessage is called. Immediate messages are NOT expired.", 
   "Subscription - Added method to getChannel that this Subscription is attatched to so we can retrieve the StoreContext for dequeue-ing the message.", 
   "TimeToLiveTest - Test of Time to live. Sends 50 msgs. 1 non-timed 48 1 second and 1 non-timed ensure only 2 msgs come back after 2 seconds"
