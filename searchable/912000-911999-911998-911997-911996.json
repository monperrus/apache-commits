   "DERBY-4341: Building with a different CLASSPATH causes runmessagecheck to fail.", 
   "This change was contributed by John Storta Jr. (js at storta dot net)",

   "it hard for us to control the exact CLASSPATH that was used, because", 
   "Ant tasks always are affected by the overall CLASSPATH that is being", 
   "used for the Ant process.", 
   "The change converts MessageBundleTest from an Ant task to a standalone Java", 
   "program, and changes the runmessagecheck target in the top-level build.xml", 
   "to run MessageBundleTest in a separate JVM with fork=true so that the", 
   "CLASSPATH setting can be exactly controlled."
