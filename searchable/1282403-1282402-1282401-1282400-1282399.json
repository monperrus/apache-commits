   "Fix for http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-23296 and http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-26069. List was throwing an RTE because selectedItems was not being updated when the dataProvider is filtered and refreshed. List was also returning null selectedItems and selectedIndices if nothing was selected before instead of an empty vector.", 
   "We now clear selection whenever a refresh happens to account for sorting/filtering. Because we only keep the selectedIndex around, we have no way of recovering the correct selection after sorting or filtering. I've also changed the selectedItems/Indices setters and getters to return an empty vector to avoid some RTEs when users grab those values.",
