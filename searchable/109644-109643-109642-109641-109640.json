   "- Changed PageFlowRequestProcessor to avoid the inversion of ordering from the base RequestProcessor when calling processActionCreate().  The FlowController class is now created/retrieved at the beginning of a request, and processActionCreate() merely uses the cached value and confirms that it is of the correct type.", 
   "- Split out two new processing stages in PageFlowRequestProcessor: processActionOverride and processPageFlowRequest.", 
   "- Fixed expression evaluation in Simple Actions and in declarative validation.  This broke when we switched to JSP 2.0 EL, which requires that implicit objects be loaded in a known place before evaluation.", 
   "- Fixed fallback Shared Flow action handling in the case where there is no root page flow and no Struts module explicitly registered in web.xml.", 
   "- Added a DRT for Simple Actions.",
