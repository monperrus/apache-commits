   "Updated dist method to reflect modern practice. Added optional isolated compilation for releases (requires a pre-1.4 JVM to run the ant tasks and the executable.javac1.4 build property to be set). Artifacts are built in new subdirectory with file ending standardisation. Ant lacks a svn task so will consider whether the source artifacts should also be created by dist."
