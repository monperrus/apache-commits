   "very first work-in-progress version for separating attach-render into two separate steps. The migration idea is to keep render as is (including attaching render) at first and copy the required code into the new attach methods. Later, when attach matures, more and more attach code can be removed from render. I'm grateful for any help on this task. This very first version fails with some (28) of the tests, basically because PageNavigation, Tree etc have not yet been ported. Most of the basic components like Border, Panel, ListView etc. should already work."
