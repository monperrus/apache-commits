   "DERBY-2692: Client driver doesn't chain exceptions received from the server", 
   "This patch makes the client recreate the chain of exceptions sent by",

   "* java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Sqlca.java:", 
   "- added a message number parameter to the methods that retrieved", 
   "mesage and SQL state", 
   "- fixed SqlErrmc parsing (used the correct delimiter) and renamed", 
   "sqlErrmcTokens_ to sqlErrmcMessages_ since the SqlErrmc was split", 
   "into its separate messages, not its tokens", 
   "- added a string array called sqlStates_, which keeps the SQL states", 
   "for each message in the chain", 
   "* java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/SqlException.java", 
   "- added a message number field to keep track of which message in the",

   "many messages", 
   "* java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/ExceptionFormatter.java",
