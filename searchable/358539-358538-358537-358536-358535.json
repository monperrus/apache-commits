   "Added an AutoFailTestSupport as the super class of CombinationTestSupport. If enabled, this enforces each test case to run only on a predefined time frame (by default 5 mins). After the allotted time, a separate thread will force the vm to exit abnormally to prevent hanging the test case. The AutoFailTestSupport is disabled by default. Should be noted, when the test case exits abnormally, no output is written to the test reports, but there is output in the log4j log file.", 
   "Enabled auto fail for ProxyConnectorTest and DiscoveryTransportBrokerTest. Added ProxyConnectorTest to testing.", 
   "Propagated the setUp and tearDown method in BrokerTestSupport."
