   "Removed ContributionService from extension registry as it can be newed up and kept hidden in a Runtime and a runtime could potentially create multiple instances of it to handle different isolated application spaces for example. Adjusted Contribution test case to not depend on SCARuntime anymore as its purpose is to test the Contribution service, not the SimpleRuntimeImpl. Removed the methods exposing the ExtensionRegistry out of the runtime, as it's not supposed to be used by application code."
