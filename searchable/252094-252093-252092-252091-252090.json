   "* Add the ability to automatically do List -> Array -> List conversions.", 
   "This involves two pieces.  First, the ArraySerializer can now happily", 
   "serialize anything that implements List (Vector, LinkedList, etc).", 
   "There is now also a check in SOAPTypeMappingRegistry for Lists in a", 
   "similar vein to the one that was already there for arrays.", 
   "LIMITATIONS: Right now we look at the first element in a List to", 
   "determine the SOAP Array type.  This means we can't use Lists which", 
   "contain multiple object types.  Long term we probably want to send", 
   "\"anyType\" as the array type and explicitly xsi:type the elements.", 
   "The second piece is in RPCProvider, which now attempts to do array ->", 
   "List conversion if the first invoke() fails with an illegal argument", 
   "exception.", 
   "The end result of all this is that you can invoke a service with a", 
   "LinkedList argument, have it get automatically serialized into a", 
   "SOAP array, and then that array automatically gets converted into", 
   "(say) a Vector on the other side so the desired function can be", 
   "called.", 
   "We might want a switch to turn this behavior on and off, and we should", 
   "probably think all the way through the ramifications of matching", 
   "methods this way (i.e. how can we decide between service(Vector) and", 
   "service(LinkedList)?)", 
   "* Add unit tests for the above.", 
   "* Add a constructor for LocalTransport which lets you specify a particular", 
   "AxisServer you'd like to use.  This allows dynamic configuration of an", 
   "AxisServer for testing (see test.encoding.TestArrayListConversions for", 
   "an example)", 
   "* Remove a few debugging statements, and add a few."
