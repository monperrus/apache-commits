   "DERBY-2775 DERBY-2917 (partial) Remove final set method (setCollationType) on TypeDescriptor to make TypeDescriptor and DataTypeDescriptor logically immutable. Required cleanup to ensure that a routine definition is only passed catalog types (TypeDescriptor) and also resulted in a cleanup of CreateAliasNode by encapsulating collation changes within the type system and RoutineAliasInfo. Also required that the tyep system use a valid JDBC Types constant for the XML type, using the Types.SQLXML from JDBC4."
