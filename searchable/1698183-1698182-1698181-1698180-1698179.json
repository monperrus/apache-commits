   "OAK-3292 : fix failing test on travis : when on a machine without a mac address, ClusterNodeInfo falls back to using random: prefix and later feels free enough to remove timed out random: entries upon creation of a new instance - this poses a problem for the fiesta test as that one tries to do very precise book-keeping of which instance is active/inactive etc - and when someone underneath removes an inactive instance, that is not noticable by the fiesta test. So the test now stops when it detects it is on such a floating machine"
