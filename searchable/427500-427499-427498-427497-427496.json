   "A patch from Ray Barlow to improve and ease reading of NullPosPrinter writing in the log.", 
   "Simply groups the printer commands (for example receipt) together so that they will dump to the logs in one go which makes it a lot easier to see the receipt formatting when developing and making changes. WIthout this patch all the lines of a print get broken across different log messages and it's very hard to see and check formatting.", 
   "Not actually used for production deployments were real printers are attached."
