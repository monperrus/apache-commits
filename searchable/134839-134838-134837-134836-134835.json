   "Refactored the Jelly engine to be XML native. Jelly now uses a class called XMLOutput which is-a SAX ContentHandler. This means that each custom tag is essentially a tap in the SAX pipestream. Indeed a custom tag can easily filter its body in a typical SAX pipeline like that used in Cocoon. Updated the documentation to reflect the new core dependencies"
