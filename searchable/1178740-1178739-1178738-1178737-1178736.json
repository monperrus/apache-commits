   "STANBOL-105: Added Support for CORS \"Access-Control-Request-Method\" by simply sending the values parsed in OPTIONS request back in the response. This basically tells that any header value can be used for requests - somthing that is in line with the implementation of the Stanbol RESTful services.", 
   "The main reason for adding support for \"Access-Control-Request-Method\" is that JavaScript frameworks (like jquery) add the \"X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\" header to indicate that an request is originated from an XMLHttpRequest. Based on the CORS principles it MUST BE explicitly requested in OPTIONS preflight requests that this hadder can be sent."
