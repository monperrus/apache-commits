   "Fixed Janne's slightly dodgy LDAP-server-existence-checking code. ;)  Tweaked unit test names and order to match the command line (ant tests) version. Removed redundant 2nd execution of TextUtilTest inside its package's AllTests class, and added in the ui.stripes.AllTests suite. These two changes mean that all 3 test methods: guitests, tests, and Eclipse all report 1024 tests. Eclipse tests show a classpath error in HtmlStringToWikiTranslatorTest that is throwing 14 errors. I'm too tired at this point to fix this. Other than that, we are cleaner than Janne's baby's bottom after a diaper change. That is to say, not perfect but perfectly presentable."
