   "Directly use FOP fonts to lay out SVG images for PDF, PS and AFP outputs.", 
   "The metrics are now taken from FOP configured fonts and no longer from AWT equivalents. That avoids discrepancies in case AWT and FOP use slightly different fonts, or if the font is not installed on the system. That actually also avoids having to install the font on the system.", 
   "FOP is also used for the primary layout of text (prior to SVG-specific transforms like translation or rotation) for consistency between SVG and XSL-FO.", 
   "This is a joint work from Peter Hancock and myself."
