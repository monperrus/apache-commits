   "Bug fix: LoginForm now injects a WikiContext, but only if one does not already exist in the page context. This plugs the bug introduced in 2.4.60. Page redirection after login works for both container and custom authentication; the web unit tests now test for this condition explicitly. The fix has been tested with Tomcat and JBoss 4."
