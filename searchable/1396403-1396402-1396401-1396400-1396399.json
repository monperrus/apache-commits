   "I was never able to reproduce the \"active by default equinox38 profile not executing\" condition locally, even with maven 2.2.1 running a full build using the same command line args that the Aries build uses. However, some research led me to believe that relying on activeByDefault=true is perilous under the best of circumstances regardless. The trick was to leave a configuration for the maven-paxexam-plugin using 3.8 within the main POM sections so there's always something to execute. Profiles for 3.7 and 3.5 are then defined and will override the 3.8 functionality when specified."
