   "Added fall back handling of layout managers that don't support IPD change (lists and tables, mainly). Their elements are simply added at the start of the new element list, so not taking the new IPD into account. This will lead to overflowing content (without notice) if there is a change from a wider page to a narrower one, and blank space at the right of the page in the opposite situation. Border- and space-before will be handled as if the element were starting on the new page (i.e., border will appear even if its conditionality has been set to \"discard\").", 
   "Element generation will be re-done starting from the first layout manager that is not enclosed by a non-restartable LM. Its space-before will be treated as if it were starting the page (i.e., ignored if .conditionality is not set to \"retain\")."
