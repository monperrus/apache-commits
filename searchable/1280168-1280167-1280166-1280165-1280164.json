   "RET was intercepting the enter key for the !multiline case and allowing it to go to TLF for the multiline case but that doesn't work since the TLF EditManager.keyUpHandler() doesn't check event.isDefaultPrevented() and does a event.stopImmediatePropogration() on the enter key.", 
   "Now we never let TLF handle the enter key.  That means for the multiline case we needed to duplicate the code from the EditManager which is never a good thing to do but unavoidable.",
