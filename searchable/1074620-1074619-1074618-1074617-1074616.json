   "AVRO-762. C: Recursive schema resolution", 
   "The avro_resolver_new function now works correctly with recursive", 
   "schemas.  We had to memoize the results of avro_resolver_new, so that we",

   "resolver within the graph of resolvers for a recursive schema type.", 
   "When freeing this graph of resolvers, we now have to take care to only", 
   "free each instance once.  We do this by maintaining a set of the", 
   "resolvers that we've already encountered during the free operation, and", 
   "immediately returning if we try to start freeing a resolver object a",
