   "This is a big update. Many of the model interfaces have been simplified.  For instance, all of the model interface", 
   "methods with URI input parameters have been removed in favor of their String counterparts (e.g. instead of", 
   "having both a Author.setUri(URI) and Author.setUri(String), it's now just Author.setUri(String).  Lots of other methods", 
   "have been removed.", 
   "This change also introduces FOMList, a java.util.List impl based on an internal iterator that is incrementally consumed", 
   "as the list is used.  This allows us to more efficiently consume the underlying parser without sacrificing the benefits of", 
   "using java.util.List versus java.util.Iterator.", 
   "A number of other improvements and simplifications have been made to the parser implementation.  More work is likely", 
   "necessary but this is, at least, a step in the right direction."
