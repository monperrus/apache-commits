   "Fix t/modperl/print.t, t/modperl/printf.t and t/directive/perlloadmodule3.t under perl-5.22.0", 
   "I'm working on CPAN RT#101962: Support for perl-5.22.0. The new \"Redundant argument in subroutine entry\" warning for printf-type functions has revealed a problem in our printf override which causes these tests to fail. In threaded builds we wrongly included the thread context in the count of arguments being passed to perl's sprintf implementation, which then warned that more arguments were being passed than the format string required. With warnings being fatalized in all test scripts this caused a few test scripts to fail."
