   "Coverted all uses of *MessageHandle to AMQMessage. A number of tests (SimpleAMQQueueTest, TxAckTest.TestMessage, AbstractHeaderExchangeTestBase.Message) still use a custom constructor on Transient/PersistentAMQMessage. This is because they have their own Message implemntations that are used for testing. However, I'm sure they could be modified to override the required functionality rather than attempt to use the existing Factory and Wrap the resulting Message. A new JIRA to address this QPID-1659.",
