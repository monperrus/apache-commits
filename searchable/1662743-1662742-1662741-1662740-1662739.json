   "Implements the \"transactional retire and settle immediately\" option for", 
   "transactions as specified in AMQP 1.0 in the qpid::messaging C++ client.", 
   "NOTE: Transactions over AMQP 1.0 require proton 0.9 or greater.  With older", 
   "versions, attempting a transactions over AMQP 1.0 will raise a link-detached", 
   "exception \"Node not found: tx-transaction\"", 
   "1. Added descriptor list to Variant with support in Encoder and PnData.", 
   "Required to support transactions, need to be able to create described lists.", 
   "Variant changes are source and binary compatible.", 
   "A Variant now has a Variant::List of descripors which can be numeric or string.", 
   "Nested descriptors are implemented by putting multiple descriptors in the list.", 
   "Other minor changes:", 
   "- Variant refactor: don't delete impl on every assignment.", 
   "- Add Variant constructors that take a string encoding.", 
   "(new constructors, not defaulted arguments, so the change is binary and source compatible.)", 
   "- Growable buffer support for Encoder.", 
   "- Printing described Variant prints descriptors in form @descriptor value", 
   "2. Added transaction support to AMQP 1.0 client code", 
   "Added messaging/amqp/Transaction.h,cpp: transaction logic",

   "to bring them into the transaction. This is consistent the 0-10 client.", 
   "Minor fixes to existing client code:", 
   "- Fix use of pn_drain API in C++ client to work with C++ and Java brokers.", 
   "- Make amqp::Exception derive from qpid::Exception", 
   "3. Fixes to existing broker code:", 
   "- Incoming.cpp fix: start async completion before processing message.", 
   "- Delay accept of dischage message till commit is complete.", 
   "- newSession - handle failover during session creation.", 
   "4. Added tests",
