   "- refactored to use a dynamic class for localization in Installer app;", 
   "- refactored to remove as many compiled URLs, names, version numbers etc. as possible, as these are subject to change. The only hard coded constants left are the URL for the Apache Flex project site and the name of the config file (in Constants.as, part of the 'common' library). All other settings are in the config file in the root of the project site;", 
   "- removed dependency on 'version.xml' on bigosmall's personal web space, moved the latest version number to the config xml file;", 
   "- implemented the custom ILog interface on MirrorURLUtil, to remove it's tight coupling to the localization classes;", 
   "- moved both InternetUtil and MirrorURLUtil to 'common' library for shared use by installer and badge;", 
   "- the Badge now uses the mirror url cgi to determine the download URL;", 
   "- minor adjustments to the Badge UI (strings and position);"
