   "Added a save/restoreGraphicsState pair for the initial coordinate system in PDF output for easier post-processing. The missing q/Q pair caused content to be upside-down when simply a new content stream is appended to the page. With this change the initial coordinate system is restored after FOP's stream is finished."
