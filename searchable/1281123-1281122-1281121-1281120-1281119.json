   "VideoDisplay/VideoPlayer changes.  The two big changes are making sure we don\u2019t call any methods on the media player when the state is \u201cloading\u201d or \u201cuninitialized\u201d.  Before we were just checking for \u201cplaybackError\u201d; however, at the time of these other states, it\u2019s not valid to call methods on mediaPlayer either.  Also, I alphabetized and organized the methods and properties in VolumeBar and also fixed a bug where we were setting muted = false in setValue().  We did this so that when the user moves around the track or the thumb, muted gets unset, but we should only do this on changes due to a user-interaction.  So I\u2019ve moved this code to a CHANGE handler instead.  All the other changes should be relatively minor.",
