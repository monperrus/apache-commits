   "Added safe-guard against reuse to avoid problems with the renderers.", 
   "Removed reset() method. Compared to the many hundred object instances that get created by the FO tree and layout engine, the Fop and FOTreeBuilder instance are negligible. Better keep the API as simple as possible and create an environmental class in the long run."
