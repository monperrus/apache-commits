   "Added support for the skip-end attribute to form widgets of type \"multi\": now it is easier to add \"global\" form parameters to multi forms by concatenating a single form to a multi form with skip-end set to true.", 
   "Modified the way submitted multi form rows are counted: now the hidden _rowCount field in the form is no more needed because rows are counted in the ServiceMultiEventHandler (using the util methods that I have implemented in the UtilHttp class)."
