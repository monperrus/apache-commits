   "Fix broken test code, that was made apparent when adding license headers to the text files. The old helper method did not test for the number of files in a directory, but rather the number of bytes in a directory. With only empty files it reported 0 (bytes), even though there were files available. This also pointed out an error in the test method itself, which was testing for the wrong condition."
