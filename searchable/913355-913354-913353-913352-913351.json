   "- Added CachedIngester", 
   "- created a DatabaseFactory that allows a Database object to be linked to a remote object through rmi or create a local DatabaseServer (non-rmi).  This was done for cases where rmi is not desired.", 
   "- currently the Crawler is in the middle of integration. . .this is not a running version. . .use previous code rev if working code is desired. . .code was solely committed to preserve changes from being lost.  Hopefully in the next rev following this commit, the Crawler will again be functional.",

   "Made changes to Ingester and to ProductCrawler's usage of Ingesters", 
   "- ProductCrawler now can accept any Ingester which controls how communication with a back end database is controlled.  Currently there are now two Ingesters: StdIngester and CacheIngester.  CacheIngester still communicates with the file manager in the same way as StdIngester however it keeps a local cache of ingested files so that queries to the file manager are limited.",
