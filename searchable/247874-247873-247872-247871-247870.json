   "Problem:", 
   "Each string element or attribute inside of a bean causes a SimpleDeserializer to", 
   "be constructed, registered, processed etc.  This is a performance hit.", 
   "Solution:", 
   "If a BeanDeserializer constructs a SimpleDeserializer for a string, it is cached", 
   "and reused.  This prevents a lot of construction/garbage collection.  It also", 
   "speeds up the processing of obtaining string deserializers.", 
   "Added two methods to SimpleDeserializer. The method reset() simply resets", 
   "the information for re-use.  The removeValueTargets method() resets the", 
   "value targets without removing the Vector.", 
   "I also organized this code under the new BeanDeserializer.getDeserializer method.", 
   "I ran some performance tests with Beans containing lots of Strings and", 
   "the BeanDeserializer.onStartChild was reduced 3 times faster.", 
   "Future:", 
   "1) I would like to make a similar change for arrays",
