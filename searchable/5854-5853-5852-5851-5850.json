   "bug 2142: code to infer MAIL FROM: address from message added, using Return-Path, X-Envelope-From and a few other common ones, and producing a synthetic fake header, EnvelopeFrom.   bug 2143: SPF support added, first draft, using Mail::SPF::Query for now.   bug 2426: spamcop-ish trusted_networks determination scheme, using MX records added; seems to work well in most setups although may extend trust further than necessary in the open-relay case.   Added nice test to detect messages that travelled entirely via domains and IPs where the domain's MX and the IP correlate."
