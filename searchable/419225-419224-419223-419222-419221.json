   "Add abstraction layer for WSM -- this code is a slight generalization of what Rich wrote for NetUI's compiler so that it could work for both XDoclet and for Java 5 annotations.  In order to support Axis2, an implementation for annogen will need to be added.", 
   "The changes here are:", 
   "- create Glass, a Mirror-like API that acts as an abstraction between the code that deals directly with the metadata and allows metadata to come from many sources", 
   "- migrate the WSM annotation checker and model builder onto Glass from Mirror.", 
   "In the long run, this is code that should live in Jakarta Commons or in a top-level Beehive sub-project as it's now used in two places.", 
   "More work remains to implement the annogen layer so that this can be run inside of Axis2.",
