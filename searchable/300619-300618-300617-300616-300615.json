   "This looks big, but it's mostly a cut-and-paste job.  The effects are to tie this tighter to Coyote and the AJP protocol.", 
   "The changes to Channel* are pretty much just cosmetic.", 
   "The AJP protocol constants have been factored into their own class, since finding them was too hard before.", 
   "The per-thread MsgContext is now the ActionHook, so it is possible to handle Actions that don't pass the Request/Response as the param (such as Mark's Body-Replay for Form auth).  Also added some explicit get/setters for things that were being handled as Notes.", 
   "The (now misnamed :) JkInputStream is the Coyote Input/OutputBuffer.  This should make it easier to implement proposed extensions like compression (encryption is better handled by the Channel).", 
   "There is almost no functional change, so this should be as stable as it was before."
