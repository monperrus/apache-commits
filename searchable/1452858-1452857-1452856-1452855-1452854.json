   "[UIMA-2498] bunch of updates needed to get new style of serialization working.  This style, instead of sequentially scanning the CAS heap and serializing out all the Feature Structures there, instead, starts from the index repositories for all views, and finds all \"reachable\" Feature Structures.  This is the same approach taken for xmi serialization, for example.  The result is that unreachable feature structures are not serialized (neither is data they reference in the various aux heaps and string heaps).  Lots of tricky issues involving treatment of delta cas serialization were debugged along the way.  I think this is now working, for equal type systems.  Next is to work on unequal type systems."
