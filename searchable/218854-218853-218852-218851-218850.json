   "Added Tim's common build file and properties. I've patched it a little to remove ${classpath} from the javadoc task (this caused javadoc to fail on Ant 1.3 on win32 for some reason). I've also added the gen-docs target to allow the creation of the TLD and HTML documentation for a single XML document for a taglib"
