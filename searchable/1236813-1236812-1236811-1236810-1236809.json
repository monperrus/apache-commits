   "- Re-introduced ontonet REST endpoint availability check (TODO other integration tests) (STANBOL-472)", 
   "- Scopes, sessions and their ontologies can now all be exported as Clerezza triple collections (Graph or MGraph), though they use in-memory SimpleMGraph (TODO implement caching of the most recent graphs?). Merging is implemented for most cases up to one import level down (for further levels, import statements are rewritten). Any triples with owl:Ontology subjects other than the one being exported are removed. This also allows JSON-LD support for the corresponding REST resources. (STANBOL-433)"
