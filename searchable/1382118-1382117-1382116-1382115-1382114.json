   "A failure will still occur if the same thing happens for a non-root subsystem. I left it that way for now for fail-fast purposes since it would be very bad for someone to muck around with the deployed content of a non-root subsystem outside of the subsystems API. It might be reasonable in the future to make this more intelligent by checking to see if the missing resource is optional or trying to re-deploy it from a repository.",
