   "patch Derby1756.2.diff.txt contributed by Sunitha Kambhampati", 
   "with derby-962 changes, if client jvm supports EUSRIDPWD then the client would", 
   "use EUSRIDPWD as the security mechanism. But it is possible that the server jvm", 
   "might not support EUSRIDPWD and the connection can fail.", 
   "When DERBY-1517, DERBY-1755 is fixed, there might be a way to use EUSRIDPWD",

   "o Do not use EUSRIDPWD as the default security mechanism even if the client vm can support it.", 
   "o Fix comments in testSecMec.java.", 
   "o Existing tests in testSecMec.java cover this codepath and the master file",
