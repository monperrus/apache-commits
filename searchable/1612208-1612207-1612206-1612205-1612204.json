   "Since we removed the specialpurpose components (but ecommerce), there was an issue with ordermgr js scripts.", 
   "The problem was double. It'd have been easy to add the missing \"/js:\" patch in allowedPaths in the web.xml of birt component from where the js scripts are now expected to be loaded in trunk.", 
   "But then you would need to also copy the js scripst there (in birt component). You could not simply move them because for upcoming branches we also need them in ordermgr component (they were there in images/js) else they would miss again.", 
   "This commit rather adds them under a simple ordermgr-js new webapp (simple, ie like framework/images, only to load resources) under commonext: applications/commonext/webapp/ordermgr-js to prevent the duplication maintenance hazards.",
