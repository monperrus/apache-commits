   "fixup for the compiler interface we now have a dedicated single compile, we also moved the compile part now", 
   "to the servlet filter so that we have the compile itself outside of jsf, that way we can ensure that a new version of the class is present", 
   "when jsf kicks in (important for resource handlers etc...)", 
   "We also fixed an issue with the classloader, it now again kicks in on taint instead of recompiled because we ran into a classcast situation with non compiled dependencies if a compiled class and a non compiled class were referencing a changed dependency."
