   "ORCHESTRA-12 fix problems with \"unable to subclass $Proxy0\", caused by spring generating java.lang.reflect.Proxy proxies for orchestra-scoped beans:", 
   "(a) move to generating the CurrentConversationAdvice proxy using a BeanPostProcessor that subclasses AbstractAutoProxyCreator, rather than calling ProxyFactory directly inline. This allows multiple proxy objects for a bean to be merged into a single proxy holding the union of all advices.", 
   "(b) poke a magic value into the bean definition to ensure CGLIB is always used for proxies of orchestra-scoped beans."
