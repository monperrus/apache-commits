   "Added new configuration parameter to InitContextListener and InitServlet called \"log4j-sysprop-name\" so one can override the more tomcat specific dynamic generation of the system property name.  This makes it compatible with any and all containers (although I've still only tested under Tomcat).  Added a semicolon to a place in ContextJNDISelector to get rid of checkstyle warning.",
