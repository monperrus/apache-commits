   "The partAdded() and partRemoved() methods of Spark components now dispatch new events named \"partAdded\" and \"partRemoved\", of type SkinPartEvent. The accessibility implementation classes will soon use these events to know when skin parts are added and removed so that they can attach and remove event handlers appropriately. This mechanism may change in a future release, so developers should not depend on these undocumented events.", 
   "I've made sure that all overrides of partAdded() and partRemoved() call the supermethod so that they dispatch these events.",

   "VideoDisplay/VideoPlayer changes.  The two big changes are making sure we don\u2019t call any methods on the media player when the state is \u201cloading\u201d or \u201cuninitialized\u201d.  Before we were just checking for \u201cplaybackError\u201d; however, at the time of these other states, it\u2019s not valid to call methods on mediaPlayer either.  Also, I alphabetized and organized the methods and properties in VolumeBar and also fixed a bug where we were setting muted = false in setValue().  We did this so that when the user moves around the track or the thumb, muted gets unset, but we should only do this on changes due to a user-interaction.  So I\u2019ve moved this code to a CHANGE handler instead.  All the other changes should be relatively minor.",
