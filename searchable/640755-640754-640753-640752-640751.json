   "Fix for TUSCANY-2119. Fixed the build of the updatesite to reference the URL of a Tuscany distribution. Added -incubating to the names of the plugin JARs. Changed the ClassPathContainer to reference the runtime JARs from the Tuscany distro downloaded with the Eclipse feature. Minor fix to the wizard to generate a targetNamespace in new composite and componentType files."
