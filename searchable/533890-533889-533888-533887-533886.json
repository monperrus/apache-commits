   "Fixing test run for the Capabilities component.", 
   "This uses the new JetspeedSerializer for seeding (and clearing) the database.",

   "I've implemented this as two separate test methods, testSetup and testTeardown which are defined as first and last (test) methods.", 
   "Note: you can now actually *debug* the TestCapability right from within Eclipse using the m2eclipse plugin running the project as external execution.", 
   "For this to work though, I had to configure the surefire plugin to *not* fork the tests (see root pom.xml).", 
   "But now by setting a breakpoint in TestCapability and running the project with goal test allows you to nicely step through the test code :)"
