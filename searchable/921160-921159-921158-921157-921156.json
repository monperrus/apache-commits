   "This is part 1 of 3 updates of the Shindig integration code that brings it up to date with the other changes to the Wookie core code; while not everything works as it should, it is now possible to integrate Wookie and Shindig once more as two cooperating webapps by following the instructions in the README. Currently only plain tokens can be used and so I've set this as the default in opensocial.properties; there is a problem creating valid encrypted tokens. See WOOKIE-52 for more information on wookie-shindig integration."
