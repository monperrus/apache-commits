   "The following changes are made:", 
   "1) The JavaBeanHelper class now generates getSerializer and getDeserializer methods.", 
   "These can be overridden by a user who wants to provide custom serialization.", 
   "The emitted code currently constructs the serializer and directly passes", 
   "it the \"macro media\" meta information.", 
   "2) The serializer base factories are improved to look for these new", 
   "getSerializer/getDeserializer methods. (I did not remove the old", 
   "lookup).  I also fixed the exception handling to be more specific.", 
   "3) Made some cosmetic improvements to help extend some of these classes.",
