   "currently it is pretty difficult to disable a userlogin by setting the deleted date to a date in the future and enable=N, further when disable a party tries to disable related userlogins but does not set that future date. This change will allow to nullify the deleted date so it is now clear the userlogin will never be enabled. The deleted date is still available in the last modified date."
