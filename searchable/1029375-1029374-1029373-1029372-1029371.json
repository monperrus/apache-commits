   "Modified SOAPConnectionImpl so that it creates a single ConfigurationContext instance that will not be shared with others.", 
   "Reasons:", 
   "* Starting with r921685, if no ConfigurationContext is supplied to the ServiceClient, it will create a new one (unless it can locate one using MessageContext.getCurrentMessageContext(), but this is not the most common use case for SOAPConnection). This means that SOAPConnection#call would create a new ConfigurationContext every time, and this is too expensive.", 
   "* We need to disable mustUnderstand processing. However, we can't do that on an AxisConfiguration that is shared with other components, because this would lead to unpredictable results."
