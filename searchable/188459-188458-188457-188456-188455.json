   "Replaced entity reference locator lookup with dynamic entity parameter substitution.",

   "Changing the Jetspeed build version for example now only needs to be changed there (and in eclipse .project)", 
   "Furthermore, now only one (master) locator.ent is needed in the root. All other (subproject) locator.ent refer to this one.", 
   "To be able to determine the correct relative directory for the external entity refererences, an external locator.path entity parameter is used."
