   "Some changes to more robustly get an address for recalculating tax, AND made it optional so that if there is no address (which we technically allow in OFBiz) it won't blow up but instead just won't recalculate tax; note that orders in that category generally don't have tax in the first place; this was reported in Jira #OFBIZ-1198; also added note for handling face-to-face or immediately fulfilled orders, which would also be applicable for rental orders... ie that special case needs to be identified by appropriate criteria and handled as needed here in the OrderServices.recalcOrderTax method AND in the related method that works on the cart when an order is placed, namely CheckOutHelper.makeTaxContext"
