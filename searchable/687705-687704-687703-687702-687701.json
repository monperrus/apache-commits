   "Abstracted Cache behind a CacheProvider Interface so that alternative implementations", 
   "can be injected by Guice.", 
   "The default implementation of the CacheProvider uses the exisitng LruCache which implements the Cache interface", 
   "The reson for not using a Guice provide is the consumers of the CacheProvider need to specify configuration", 
   "settings, there may be a better way of doing this, but this approach appears workable and simple.", 
   "There are no configuration changes required in the deployment so where guice has been used to inject the cache", 
   "this change should be transparent. Where the cache was manually injected a new default cache provider needs to be", 
   "manually created, hence the patces to the various Tests."
