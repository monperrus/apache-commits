   "This implementation in pure Java NIO is almost a mimic of the APR implementation. It blocks on read and write, but has non blocking polling capabilities. Currently the read/write blocking is \"busy\" blocking, but I will see if I can simply configure blocking for the socket and if that would still allow the poller to work as expected.", 
   "This makes it a suitable connector for comet style protocols and where APR is not desired or available."
