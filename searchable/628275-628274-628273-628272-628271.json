   "Updated Glyphs.java to use the latest Adobe Glyph Lists. The Adobe Glyph Lists are now included as originals and loaded as resources. The license seems to be compatible with the ALv2. The ZapfDingbats glyph names are now also included. Support for the complete mapping process (except characters above 0xFFFF) implemented, i.e. you can use character names such as uniXXXX and uXXXX.", 
   "Added a mechanism to provide glyph name alternatives which were manually hacked into our old glyph lists."
