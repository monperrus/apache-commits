It gets a list of all the networks available on the VM host and adds an adapter for any that match up with the image project name. Added Linux.pm::activate_interfaces which finds and activates network interfaces which don't have a corresponding ifcfg-eth* file. The file is created and the interface is brought up allowing interfaces to be added dynamically during load. This is called by Linux.pm::post_load.",

These subroutines make the Linux code more inline with the Windows code and will allow the utils.pm::getdynamicaddress to be removed.", 
   "Fixed a bug in Linux.pm::execute. It was using the computer host name rather than the node name. This caused SSH commands to fail because it was attempting to connect to a full DNS host name configured in the computer table which didn't resolve."
