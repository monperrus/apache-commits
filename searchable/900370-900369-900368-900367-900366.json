   "This changeset refactors the injection mechanism for start files, and implements a custom serializer for HtmlCleaner that omits event handler attributes from escaping as well as script tags and stylesheets;this fixes WOOKIE-102 and WOOKIE-64. Two sets of unit tests have also been added for the new classes. Hopefully the new implementation is easier to understand as well as fixing the issues; there is also scope for replacing HTMLCleaner with alternative implementations such as Neko or JTidy using the IHtmlProcessor interface."
