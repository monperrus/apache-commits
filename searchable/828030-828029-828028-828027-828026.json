   "make write targets computable independent of replication strategy (i.e., make getReadStorageEndPoints the only method a Strategy needs to implement).  we do this by computing the token/endpoint -> Range[] map from the read endpoints, then using that to determine if a bootstrapping node needs to receive a write (if the token being written falls in any of its ranges).  Also, make the StorageProxy insert methods aware that bootstrap can entail having extra write targets temporarily, and include those in its consistencylevel calculations.",
