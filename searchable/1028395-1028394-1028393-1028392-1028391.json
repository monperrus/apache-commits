   "Updated core modules to allow a DataStructure and provisioning object to be created without a corresponding reservation.  This allows provisioning modules to implement a node_status which can be called as a regular non-object function, while the node_status subroutine uses the DataStructure and other object-oriented functions in the same manner as normal reservations.", 
   "Updated DataStructure.pm to allow objects to be created by passing an imagerevision ID.  Updated this module to populate the image and imagerevision data if it was passed an image, imagerevision, or computer ID argument.", 
   "Moved subroutines from set_os and os subroutines from Provisioning.pm to Module.pm.  Moved set_provisioner and provisioner subroutines to Module.pm.  This allows them to be available to all types of modules.", 
   "Added Module.pm::create_provisioning_object and create_os_object.  These are called by State.pm::initialize rather than having the code directly in State.pm::initialize.  This allows other objects to create an OS or provisioning object if necessary.", 
   "Other", 
   "Updated DataStructure.pm::get_reservation_info_string to display additional data.", 
   "Removed utils.pm::getdynamicaddress.  It has been replaced by code in the OS modules.", 
   "Updated utils.pm::get_computer_info to add the VM host data under the 'computer' key in the hash it returns.  This allows the data it returns to match get_request_info."
