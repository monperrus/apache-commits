   "SHIRO-196 - Ensured StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer was used where possible.  One method chould not be changed without breaking backwards compatibility and was flagged as deprecated to be changed for Shiro 2.x.  Added RELEASE_NOTES.txt as a place holder for developers to jot down notes while working in source code.  See the file for more information on proposed usage."
