   "The previous attempt at supporting something similar to the JSP 2.1 jspid's didn't work out (SHALE-67).  I overlooked all the reuse of the config beans.  The same config bean might be pulled in to the same page composition several times thus creating duplicate component id's.  The config beans's jspid is now stored as a component's attribute and used to find its  location in a restored tree.  The view root is used to generate unique component ids."
