   "Changed method signature of SecurityManager#logout(PrincipalCollection) to be SecurityManager#logout(Subject).  This was surprisingly a very minimal change - the method was only referenced in one location.  This was mandatory because of the need to send in not only the PrincipalCollection, but the currently referenced session ID, which could potentially be different than the thread-bound session id.  Also, a more coarse-grained method argument affords for more flexible changes in the future without disrupting a core interface."
