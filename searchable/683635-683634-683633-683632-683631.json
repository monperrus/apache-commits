   "QPID-1182 : Some of the NullPointerExceptions from the SimpleACLTest are due to the close and the notification overlapping due to the lack of locking. The problem is that the AtomicBoolean _closed is used for control but the AMQSession.checkNotClosed needs to check _closed and then throw any exception in the StateManager. However, in a loop of the SimpleACLTest, I would see _closed == false but then it is set right afterwards but the option to check AMQStateManager and throw the exception is past and the super.Closeable.checkNotClosed is called and throws the JMSException with no linked exception hence the test throws NullPointerException"
