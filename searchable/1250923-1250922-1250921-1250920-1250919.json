   "The changes here are mostly fixing some sizing issues.", 
   "For the FlashContainerPlaceholder, the first child is now MyFlexContentHolder, which extends mx.flash.FlexContentHolder but meets the invariant that it has 1 child and that child is  FlexContentHolderThumbnail, which I\u2019ve added as a swc to the project.  I changed this by accident last time to refer to mx.flash.FlexContentHolder, when it should've referred to a concrete instance created by Flash from a swc.  I also added a chrome of 151x151 to match the FlexContentHolderThumbnail since otherwise the container itself would have no chrome at all, and this let\u2019s it size correctly.", 
   "Also, for sizing, in a container, rather than sizing to the size of the chrome, I now size to the size of the FlexContentHolder thumbnail that all FlexContentHolder\u2019s have.  This means in ContainerMovieClip, I don\u2019t need to override bounds anymore.", 
   "ContainerMovieClip now implements IVisualElementContainer.", 
   "Also, I fixed a resizing event bug in UIMovieClip where the resize event was getting dispatched more than once.",
