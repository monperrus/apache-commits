   "Flex now requires CSS Style declarations to declare @namespace rules and disambiguate between halo and spark components using CSS 3 namespace prefixes on type selectors. At compile time, this namespace information will be used to map type names to qualified ActionScript class names.

Flex 3 applications must be compiled with -compatibility-version=3.0.0 to get unqualified CSS type selector behavior.",
