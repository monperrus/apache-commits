   "* Refactored the username determination into its own subroutine. This actually fixed a bug on Windows as WSACleanup() is now called on failure.", 
   "* Made the memory for username allocated dynamically. Why always use 255 bytes with some weird buffer handling when often a few bytes are enough?", 
   "* Got rid of an ifdef-bug on Windows I introduced before."
