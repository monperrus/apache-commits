   "Simplify the build process of the Eclipse codegen plugin by using maven-bundle-plugin. This has multiple advantages:", 
   "* The bundle plugin automatically generates a manifest for the plugin and embeds the necessary dependencies into the plugin. -> no need anymore to play around with ant and maven-assembly-plugin", 
   "* Since the plugin now has a manifest, the dependencies no longer need to be specified in plugin.xml. -> plugin.xml no longer needs to be generated and is a static file; no need anymore to keep the plugin dependencies in sync with the Maven dependencies", 
   "* maven-bundle-plugin takes care to generate an appropriate bundle version number from the Maven version number. -> no need anymore to manually change the plugin version number before or after a release", 
   "The only remaining scripting part in the build is a small Groovy snippet that determines the bundle symbolic name and version."
