   "MNG-2963: Do not write the metadata out when you cannot contact the server. When you are offline or something else screws up empty metadata files will get written and then you're hosed. In training this week I was bitten again where there is not connection, someone runs the lifecycle and nothing can be found and you're left with the user completely guessing as to how to fix this. People are resorting to wiping out their entire local repositories to fix this type of thing which is ridiculous. Retrying things and working is far better then putting users in a quandry."
