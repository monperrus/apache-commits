   "- Improved the build process' with respect to its dependencies on JUnit, JDepend and an XSLT processor.", 
   "- Included DDF in the generated javadoc API documentation.", 
   "- Excluded the obsolete HDF from the generated javadoc API documentation.", 
   "- Included the CLASSPATH environment variable in the javadoc classpath so that references to third-party packages can be resolved.", 
   "- Removed all explicit references to Xalan and changed the HSSF record generator to use any XSLT processor. However, that stuff seems to be very much out of date: The XSL stylesheet won't compile even after an obvious fix. Thus my modifications are untested but that stuff won't work anyway. I doubt it is important.", 
   "- Did some beautifications on the build.xml file."
