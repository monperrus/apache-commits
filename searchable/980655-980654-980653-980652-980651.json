   "Added ability to create new shipment groups to an existing order. This also fixes a bug mentioned in one of the comments to \"OFBIZ-1809\" (duplicated ship groups were assigned to newly created items when they were not assigned to the first ship group). Misc code formatting fixes that I did while wading thru the code."
