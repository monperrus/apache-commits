   "The sendMail service has a problem where any email addresses that fail a RCPT TO: SMTP check causes the message to not be sent to any of the valid recipients.  Fixed by making use of the mail.smtp.sendpartial property which enables the message to still be delivered to valid recipients.  I've made sendpartial = true the default but also made it configurable via general.properties.  This is the first part of a fix for OFBIZ-3379"
