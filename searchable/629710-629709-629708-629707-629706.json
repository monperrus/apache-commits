   "It turns out that many sites have more than one sub domain, and I wasn't smart enough to realize this, so I re-introduced the parent parameter in a way that is both compatible with existing sites and secure. You may now use a regular expression to validate that the parent parameter is acceptable for the given syndicator, and gadgets.rpc will append your parentRelayUrl to the \"parent\" parameter. Since the server is validating the parent, this can be trusted.",
