   "Changed back to throw an exception when a non-body parameter is passed to a secure request that calls a service as an event; now that we have the Form Widget and form defs fixed up to handle these better it should be fine for most things, but chances are there are some links in FTL files that will still be broken and will need to be manually fixed; with this we can look forward to more issues and questions/comments on the mailing list, but this also makes it a lot more secure and pretty difficult to spoof one of these requests (will have to hack HTTPS and encrypt the body to do so)"
