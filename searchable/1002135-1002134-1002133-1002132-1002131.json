   "TUSCANY-3674 - Add in a new mojo for generating meta data about groups of bundles, i.e. Tuscany extensions. This is basically a copy of ModuleBundlesBuildMojo.java but massaged to generate ant filesets, manifest etc. for a specified set of dependencies rather than for artefacts with the string \"feature\" in the name. It also doesn't do the copying of jars into /modules. There is therefore a lot of complexity in here that's not required. Needs rationalising if we decide we like the output."
