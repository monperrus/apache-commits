   "Added a SOAP11 encoding built-in Schema Type system which allows us to correctly parse schemas with references to SOAPenc:Array without needing anything extra on the classpath (and without actually using the classpath to load types).", 
   "Added a new target to the build.xml file, \"enum-support.jar\", which creates a jar containing the classes from xbean.jar that are needed in order to compile the generated enumeration classes (so instead of compiling them with xbean.jar on the classpath, one would compile them with only this small 12k jar on the cp).",
