   "- Added Embedded.createConnector() methods that take address of type", 
   "String (instead of java.net.InetAddress), since the InetAddress is", 
   "always converted to a string (and stored with the Connector's", 
   "properties) anyways", 
   "- Fixed problem that was caused by the fact that the InetAddress", 
   "passed to Embedded.createConnector() was converted to a string using", 
   "InetAddress.toString(), and added to the Connector's", 
   "properties. However, InetAddress.toString() returns a string of the", 
   "form \"<hostname>/<literal_IP>\".", 
   "Setting the address property on the underlying Http11Protocol would", 
   "always fail, because IntrospectionUtils.setProperty() would parse the", 
   "address string into an InetAddress like this:", 
   "InetAddress.getByName(value);", 
   "which throws a java.net.UnknownHostException (due to \"value\" being of", 
   "the form \"<hostname>/<literal_IP>\"). Unfortunately, the exception is", 
   "being swallowed.", 
   "The fix in Embedded.createConnector() checks of the address string", 
   "contains a '/', and only stores the IP part of the address with the", 
   "Connector's properties."
