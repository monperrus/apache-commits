   "[WSS-194] - Support overriding KeyStore alias for signature so that it can be different than user name used for UsernameToken", 
   "- I added WSHandlerConstants.SIGNATURE_USER to specify a different \"signature user\" from WSHandlerConstants.USER", 
   "- This is consistent with the previous pattern of ENCRYPTION_USER", 
   "- A side-effect is that the SignatureAction now relies on RequestData.getSignatureUser() rather than getUser", 
   "- Added a test for this issue as well."
