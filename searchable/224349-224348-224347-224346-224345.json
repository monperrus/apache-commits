   "Added 2 new features to the TCP Lateral cache, some test files, and some unit tests.",

   "1.  Can send but not receive using the TCP lateral cache", 
   "By default you do both.", 
   "jcs.auxiliary.LTCP.attributes.Receive=false", 
   "This turns off receiving.  If you just want to broadcast invalidations or puts this is useful.", 
   "Not all nodes need to receive.  A data producer might not want to get messages.", 
   "This is very useful.", 
   "2.  Configurationless TCP lateral cache", 
   "You can configure the TCP lateral to use UDP discovery.", 
   "Lateral caches will broadcast to a multicast address and port, letting", 
   "all listeners know where they are.  One startup each lateral will request a broadcast from the others.", 
   "Broadcasts occur every 30 seconds. (to be made configurable)", 
   "Regions that don't receive don't broadcast anythign but requests.", 
   "When a lateral receives a discovery message it will try to add the lateral to the nowait facade for the", 
   "region.  If it already exists nothing happens.  If a region is not configured to send laterally, nothing happens,", 
   "since it doesn't have a no wait.", 
   "This allows you to have the same configuration on every machine.",
