Implement equals() and hashCode() for the generated ReplyTo class to let it function properly as an index in the hashmap to resolve the issue. Update PropertyValueTest to remember the initial reply-to destination it sets and compare it with the value returned after sending/receiving the message, rather than constituting its own test destination for comparison."
