   "On certain (unnamed) broken OSs, it is expensive to have hundreds of threads blocking on reads.  Using ChannelNioSocket instead of ChannelSocket means that all active threads are processing requests, so fewer threads are needed.  If using a non-broken OS, ChannelNioSocket is probably slower than ChannelSocket.  It also has extra GC vs Remy's ChannelAprSocket."
