   "DERBY-6773: Derby throws plain SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException", 
   "This patch includes contributions from Abhinav Gupta (abhinavgupta2004 at gmail dot com)", 
   "This patch enables use of the new Derby-specific subclass", 
   "of SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException in both the embedded", 
   "and client-server configurations of the SQLExceptionFactory.", 
   "In addition, a number of new tests are added to verify that", 
   "the new exception is thrown and can be caught as we expect,", 
   "and that the accessor methods on the new exception allow", 
   "applications to determine which table name and constraint", 
   "name were responsible for the exception.", 
   "We still have a couple cleanup tasks before DERBY-6773 is", 
   "fully complete, but as of this patch the new behavior is", 
   "in effect."
