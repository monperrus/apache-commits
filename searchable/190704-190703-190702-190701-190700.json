   "o Added sourceLevel (meaning global vs. user) to most base classes in the model, to track for the purposes of rewriting the user-level settings ONLY.", 
   "o Added an identity base class for many of these same base classes, to allow sorting/merging based on id (shallow merging) using a common piece of code.", 
   "o Added support for pluginUpdates (first pass) within the settings.xml, and support for merging this new section based on plugin key (g:a)",
