   "added a fix for CAMEL-5566 along the lines of Romain's use of @CamelContextId though preferred the name @CamelStartup which makes it really easy to startup a RouteBuilder on a CamelContext. Also patched the injection code to support @Inject @Uri, @EndpointInject, @Produce, @Consume to support multiple CamelContext instances too (needs testing though ;)"
