   "* Start of an implementation. It's NOT working right now. I'm committing it only so that others can see what I'm doing and help/give some advice. I'm feeling that doing the parsing by hand is a bit too tedious than it should be. OTOH using tools like JavaCC/ANTLR is not easy, is hard to maintain and is potentially more complex to tune for performances. If someone is an expert in this domain, please let me know what's the best strategy.", 
   "The tests also need to be cleaned up. I'm still unsure what's the best strategy for testing Sink and Parser implementations.", 
   "Last, the Parser currently relies on Blocks defined in the Confluence module. We need to create a generic Block sub project."
