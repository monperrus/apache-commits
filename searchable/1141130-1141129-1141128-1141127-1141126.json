   "Added support in Flatpack  (see WOOKIE-182) for selective \"flattening\" of features. The test cases use JQuery Mobile - so when exporting Widgets that require JQM the relevant resources (js, css, images) are included in the exported .wgt package and the <feature> element removed from config.xml. The general approach is that features that are Wookie-specific conveniences/normalization for loading common libraries (like JQM) are flattened on export to improve interoperability. Features are flagged for this treatment by including a 'flatten=\"true\"' attribute in feature.xml."
