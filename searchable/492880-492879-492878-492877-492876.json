   "fix NPE issues with not existing objects of PK/FK. This could be the case if a PK of an object is the FK to a 1:1 reference. If the reference is deleted the PK of the main object still exists and OJB will create a proxy object for the 1:1 reference. On materialization of the proxy OJB can't find the reference, thus we return 'null' for all object methods and log a warn message."
