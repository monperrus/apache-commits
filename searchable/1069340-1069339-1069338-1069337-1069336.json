   "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3176 - Potential deadlock in duplex network connector recreation, resulting in dangling connections. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3129 - Can only have one duplex networkConnection per transportConnection. Rework of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2774. NetworkConnector.name attribute (default NC) is used to differenciate duplex network connectors so it needs to be unique to allow multiple to be configured. Removing existing matching network connectors on a reconnect is now thread safe"
