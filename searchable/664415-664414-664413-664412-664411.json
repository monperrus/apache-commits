   "Fix for Out-Of-Memory error in a simple client that calls addPort to dynamically add ports. Each addPort causing a new EndpointDescription and AxisService to be created. And, since each call to Service.create() creates a new service delegate, this can cause a problem in a server environment where the client AxisConfiguration is cached.", 
   "Added logic to re-use the EndpointDescriptionImpl objects across identical addPorts on the same service. We are caching them in the AxisConfiguration as that is the only common location. Also using WeakReferences to allow the jvm to clean up the instances that are no longer used."
