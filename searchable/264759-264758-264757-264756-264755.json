   "Fix PR36410; Change how the get_suexec_identity hook is handled by CGID.", 
   "Instead of using mod_userdir and mod_suexec specific hacks, we now run the hook",

   "If this is NULL, we pass on a magic empty_ugid constant, otherwise pass on the", 
   "real ugid.", 
   "On the cgid side of the equation, we add our own hook, with REALLY_FIRST, and", 
   "then order the hooks. This ensures that cgid's doer runs before any other", 
   "registered get_suexec_identity doers.", 
   "We use cgid's request config to store the ugid. If ugid == empty_ugid, we DON'T", 
   "call ap_os_create_privileged_process, because our doer would return the magic", 
   "empty_ugid constant. Having the doer return NULL is no good, because then", 
   "userdir and mod_suexec's doers would be called. Instead, we call plain old",
