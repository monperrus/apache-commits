   "This required a major re-factoring of the async implementation. In summary:", 
   "- Moved state management to the Coyote Processor", 
   "- Added a SocketWrapper to the APR socket", 
   "- Added syncs to ensure only one async state change at a time", 
   "- Added syncs to ensure only one thread changing a socket's state at a time", 
   "A number of new bugs were also uncovered and fixed by this re-factoring:", 
   "- delay processing complete() and dispatch() until request where startAsync() is called finished processing", 
   "- onAsyncStart listener event", 
   "Currently the test case for bug 49884 passes with the security manager enabled using \"ab -n 5000 -c 150 -k ...\" (it broke with \"ab -n 50 -c 10 ...\" previously)", 
   "The unit tests pass for all three HTTP connectors.", 
   "The AJP connectors have only been modified to ensure the code compiles.", 
   "The following work remains:", 
   "- Testing all connectors (HTTP and AJP) with TCK + security manager and fixing whatever is broken", 
   "- Further clean-up", 
   "- There is further scope for reducing code duplication between the connectors / aligning the code so it is easier to maintain."
