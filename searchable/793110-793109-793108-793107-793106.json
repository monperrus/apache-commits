   "Added a method for assigning a new byte array to HttpResponse objects without performing another copy. This allows for distributed caches that don't use java serialization to rebuild objects without double parsing, as well as allowing for some more efficient implementation of the image resizing code. This isn't much of a safety concern because the byte[] of the HttpResponse objects are still technically mutable when using getResponseAsBytes() in any case. Given that java has no efficient immutable byte array, this will have to do."
