   "[HBASE-10177] Fix the netty dependency issue", 
   "Author: gauravm", 
   "Summary:", 
   "The netty developers changed their group id from org.jboss.netty to io.netty. As a result, the zookeeper and hadoop dependencies pull in the older netty (3.2.2) and swift related dependencies pull in the newer netty (3.7.0). As a result we get ClassNotFoundExceptions, when the older 3.2.2 jar is picked up in place of 3.7.0.", 
   "This is the same as the commit made on the swift branch.", 
   "Test Plan: mvn dependency:tree doesn't pull in the 3.2.2 jar.",
