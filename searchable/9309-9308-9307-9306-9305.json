   "bug 3077: more work to speed up remove_spamassassin_markup...  'report_safe 0' now saves a pristine copy of the header to X-Spam-Prev-Header, and remove_sa_markup properly moves it back.  it also keep backward compatibility for pre-3.0's rewrite headers, which unfortunately means the config is loaded.  but now we only load the config when necessary (ie: if the message(s) are report_safe encapsulated, no config is read. ;)    made a few other efficiency improvements, and fixed the stripmarkup test to deal with the new way the markup is removed."
