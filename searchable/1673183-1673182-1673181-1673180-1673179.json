   "SOLR-6692: Made standard highlighter more extensible", 
   "Private methods are now protected, removed bad constructor, and refactored out getFieldValues() and getResponseForFragments() for both clarity and sub-class extension utility.  Some refactoring of doHighlightingByHighlighter to clarify logic.  These changes should have ZERO effect on highlights."
