   "\"Improve ICO file support\" patch from Damjan Jovanovic.", 
   "Jira issue key: SANSELAN-40", 
   "Damjan's notes, part 1:", 
   "I am submitting a patch that improves Sanselan's ICO format support. It adds:", 
   "1. Support for Windows Vista ICO files with embedded PNGs", 
   "2. Support for 256x256 icons (reported as 0x0)", 
   "3. Support for top-down and bottom-up bitmaps", 
   "Damjan's notes, part 2:", 
   "New version of the patch. The patch now:", 
   "Uses only the BITMAPINFOHEADER to parse the icon (using the ICONDIRENTRY is wrong and the tests included prove it)", 
   "Adds support for writing ICO files", 
   "Adds support for reading 16 BPP ICO files", 
   "Adds support for compressed bitmaps", 
   "Adds support for the Windows Vista (and later) PNG ICO format", 
   "Verifies crucial fields in ICO files", 
   "Adds extensive tests", 
   "In fact the only feature now missing is support for the alpha channel in 32 BPP bitmaps, and that is something that needs to be added to BmpImageParser along with support for BITMAPV4HEADER/BITMAPV5HEADER anyway."
