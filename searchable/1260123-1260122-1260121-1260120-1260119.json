   "Makes auto-reversal of transitions work more completely and correctly, fixing some API issues and other related animation/effect issues along the way. Seeking behavior in effects is improved (although still far from perfect, especially for non-playing effects), and dynamic behavior of effects (picking up values dynamically from the environment) is improved.", 
   "QE Notes: better seek() behavior, can just call it on non-playing effects and it will automatically play/pause the effect if necessary",

   "Fix for sdk-17172. Extends to all effects the behavior in Flex4 effects of setting the end-state values when an effect is done, rather than the previous behavior in Flex 3 of letting an effect override these values and just animate to whatever values they set. Now this behavior is default for all effects, including Action effects, with a backward-compatible opt-out or a protected variable that subclasses of Effect can choose to override.",
