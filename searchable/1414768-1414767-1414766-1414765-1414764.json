   "Fixed problem in Upstart.pm::delete_service. Previous versions of the Ubuntu code were configuring a service named ext_sshd. The new code calls it ext_ssh to match the regular ssh service name. The delete_service subroutine wasn't attempting to delete both names. As a result, images loaded with older code having a service named ext_sshd failed. Updated code to attempt to delete both service names."
