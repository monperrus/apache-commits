   "[master]Let HMaster not close DFS client when there is transient failure", 
   "Author: fan", 
   "Summary: Currently when DFS client has problem, HMaster will close it but still loops on checking its availability. So when name node comes back, HMaster does not recover.", 
   "Test Plan: Push new jar to master of a shadow cluster, then shut down name node for a couple minutes. When name node is brought back, HMaster should recover soon.",
