   "updated fix: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3982", 
   "Instead of locking on the PList iterator which forces a lock on every access to hasNext we should lock down at the PageFile level in readPage making the seek and read an atomic operation.  Since many reads on a single already loaded page don't need to be synchronized we pay a higher price for locking in the specific PList case than we do buy creating this atomic read operation in PageFile."
