   "Fix for Process and Instance Management API's listInstances method's filter problem. Filter support was not there for listInstances method when using OpenJPA. Also according to the pmapi schema, there must be event-info element with first, last and count child elements in the instance-info XML returned by listInstances Web Service API method. But implementation was not there and fix for that also available in this patch. There are some coding improvements for org/apache/ode/dao/jpa/BPELDAOConnectionImpl.java."
