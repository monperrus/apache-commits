   "the relevant slave PIDs are saved in a map and the original Offer is deleted. This way a Scheduler can directly", 
   "lookup the Slave PID and send FW msgs. Similarly, the Framework struct at the Slave was augmented with PIDs which", 
   "are sent by a master when M2S_RUN_TASK is sent. Hence a slave can directly send a FW msg to the scheduler."
