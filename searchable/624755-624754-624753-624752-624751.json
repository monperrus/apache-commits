   "Fixed a nasty, serious authentication bug introduced in 2.3.35 code for checking for cookie changes. Cookie changes were triggering \"container logins\", which caused the JAAS Subject to be rebuilt from scratch. Instead of blowing away the Subject (and associated WikiSession) at logout time (or when the user's auth status changes), the Subject is now preserved for the life of the Http Session. In addition, executing Logout.jsp no longer invalidates the HTTP session; instead, the AuthenticationManager logout() method simply resets the Subject's principal set instead."
