   "Changed the behavior of the UserDatabase and GroupDatabase classes so that the save/delete methods are atomic. Consequently, the commit() methods in these classes are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The reason for this change is simple: the commit() methods made no sense and were never *not* used. Also, added a new method, rename(), that permits renaming of profile login names. References to commit() were removed from all classes, including test classes."
