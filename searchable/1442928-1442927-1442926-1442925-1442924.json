   "This commit provides fixes for most, possibly all of the failures experienced with the OSGi Remote Services and Remote Service Admin CTs.", 
   "There is a small number of CT failures that relate to the arrival of events, but it looks like there might be an error in the CT logic around this. I have raised an issue against the CT for this.", 
   "I added unit tests for most of the behaviour that I changed, but am planning to add more unit tests in subsequent commits."
