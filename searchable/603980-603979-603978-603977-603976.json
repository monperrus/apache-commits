   "The commit comments for trunk were as follows", 
   "The outerjoin.sql was failing because the part of the runtime statistcis info was getting erased before LanguageResultSet.close() code collected it all. I moved the erasing of runtime stat code so that it happened once the stat was collected successfully.", 
   "In addition, I removed redundant code of closing and finishing the LanguageResultSet from EmbedResultSet.java because these steps happen as part of activation.close"
