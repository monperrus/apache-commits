   "Windows_mod.pm::create_user() - Improved the \"if\" statement logic where the value retrieved from imagemeta.rootaccess is checked. If the value was undefined because the database didn't contain the column, a warning message would appear in the log output. It was working correctly but the new logic prevents the warning message from appearing.", 
   "utils.pm::get_imagemeta_info() - Added line to set the rootaccess key in the hash being returned to 1 if it isn't defined in the database. This helps ensure the default is always to grant rootaccess unless explicitly configured to not grant root access.",

   "Windows_mod.pm::user_exists() - Changed run_ssh_command() to not display output. It was causing a large section of user into to appear in the log file."
