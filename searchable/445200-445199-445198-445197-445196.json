   "o Finished GERONIMO-181 Transaction propogation accross calls to stateful session beans", 
   "o Added code resume and suspend the BMT transaction to StatefulInstanceInterceptor.  This code must be here because the instance context holds the suspended transaction, and this context is not available in the transaction interceptor.  Also the code that \"finds\" the correct instance relies on the transaction context already being established", 
   "o Enabled stateful tests for session synchronization callbacks", 
   "o Session synchronization callbacks now go through the system interceptor chain", 
   "o Container policies now setRollbackOnly and throw a TransactionRolledbac[Local]Exception when a system exception is thrown in an inherited transaction", 
   "o Fixed GERONIMO-579 UserTransaction broken after BMT calls BMT", 
   "o Added support for ejb-ql back into the openejb-jar.xml file so 1.1 beans can use ejb-ql for a query specification", 
   "o Fixed client side handle serialization code", 
   "o Fixed stateful session ejb object isIdentical code; was not comparing primary key", 
   "o Fixed handling of remove methods"
