   "Summary:", 
   "Doing a rolling restart on the darklaunch cluster, I noticed that the", 
   "rolling restart script had gotten stuck because it could not get hbck", 
   "to be OK. This was because we had gotten into a situation where there", 
   "was one region that was unassigned.", 
   "Here is a rough sketch of what happened. The region was on Secondary, when", 
   "Primary came up.", 
   "Master wanted to move the region from Secondary to Primary; asking the", 
   "secondary to close the region.", 
   "The request in RIT timed out and was deleted.", 
   "- metaScanner should have seen an unassigned region and fixed it.", 
   "Secondary closed the region, but was unable to update META, because the server", 
   "hosting .META. was down.", 
   "- ProcessServerClose could not update .META.", 
   "- ProcessServerClose should not have succeded. But a bug/race condition let", 
   "it believe that things were fine.", 
   "MetaScanner ran multiple times, but did not bother re-assigning the region", 
   "because everything seemed fine in .META.; It was as if the region was still on", 
   "the old server (Secondary).", 
   "The fix is really simple. We cannot ignore .META. unavailability in the", 
   "innermost level.",
