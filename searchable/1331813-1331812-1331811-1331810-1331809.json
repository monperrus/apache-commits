   "AVRO-1048. C: Use less stack space in avro_file_writer_create", 
   "The avro_file_writer_create function use to allocate a 64K buffer on the", 
   "stack to render the JSON encoding of the file's schema into.  This isn't", 
   "really the best if you've got limited stack space \u2014 for instance, if", 
   "you're creating a data file from a thread or coroutine with a 64K stack.", 
   "This patch moves the scratch buffer into the avro_file_writer instance", 
   "itself; we're already allocating that from the heap, and it's easy", 
   "enough to add the 64K buffer to the end of the type."
