   "implementation as described by STANBOL-1237: This include the ModelWriter, ModelWriterRegistry, JSON ModelWriter implementation, Clerezza ModelWriter in an own module, Sesame ModelWriter in an own module - STANBOL-1234, deletion of the old serializer classes, JSON serializer module for FieldQueries; NOTE: all new classes are under the o.a.s.entityhub.web package. The remaining classes under entityhub.jersey should also be moved as part of STANBOL-1127. Also the current entityhub.jersey module should become entityhub.web.base. However those changes are outside of the scope of STANBOL-1237 and therefore not part of this commit"
