   "Re-worked build.xml so that nearly all built artifacts, including for tests and webtests, are now produced in the \"build\" directory. Minor additional tweaks to prevent test classes from being included in JSPWiki.jar, which was messing up webapp tests. Added priha.properties to the WAR. Webtests are still broken, but less so than before. Upgraded Selenium-RC to 1.0b2; if webtests can be actually made to work, at least we will now be able to use them with Firefox 3."
