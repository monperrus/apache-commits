   "Continued Exception-handling cleanup.", 
   "This CL continues the now-prevalent pattern in Shindig of wrapping an HTTP status code with checked Exceptions. This pattern stands in contrast to introducing (with lots of associated refactoring) several new types of checked exceptions, and seems to do the job pretty well for reasonably minimal effort.", 
   "Specific changes:", 
   "1. Add HTTP response code optionally to GadgetException. Upon audit I found that all caught GadgetExceptions that were being transformed into user response were transformed into SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, so I've defaulted the exception's status code to that.", 
   "2. Add response code as required to RewritingException. RewritingException was so useless before that it was never thrown - instead, RuntimeException was thrown, wrapping GadgetException in a few circumstances. This has been disentangled.", 
   "I'm leaving specific response-code changes resulting from GadgetException throw/catch to a follow-up CL."
