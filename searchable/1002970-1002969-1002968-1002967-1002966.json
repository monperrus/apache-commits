   "Removed the axiom-parser-tests module. This module was used to test compatibility with different StAX implementations. It used a \"brute force\" approach, which was to reexecute the entire Axiom test suite several times with different parsers. Since we now have fairly complete set of StAX dialect tests in axiom-api, we no longer need axiom-parser-tests. This should considerably reduce the build time."
