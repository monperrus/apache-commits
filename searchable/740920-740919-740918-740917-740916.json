   "Adds the ability to define what the comparison is for map keys, defaults to the standard std::less comparator.  Completes the definition of the Comparator interface in Util, adds a PointerComparator to the Pointer class so that the elements in a Pointer can be compared based on the actual contained objects and not just the underlying pointer value.  Adds some test cases to validate these classes."
