   "Merged from CVS HEAD. I'm worried as it seems the first merge failed but no error was reported to me... The second merge was better but not quite right and I had to manually fix stuff. I'm worried that others errors like this may have crept in the 1.5 branch... Will need to do a thorough check before releasing it"
