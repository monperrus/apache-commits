   "- Methods with OMOutputImpl have been moved to OMNodeEx from OMNode and added typecasts in all the code that uses them (internal usages)", 
   "- Methods with OMOutputImpl has been removed from OMDocument.",

   "- Minor spelling/javadoc cleanup", 
   "TODO:",

   "- Review OMOutputImpl usages again to see if things can be simplified further."
