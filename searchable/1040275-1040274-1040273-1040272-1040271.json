   "[UIMA-1952] update Readme, release notes; change POM to include a dependency on the binary base uimaj-distr artifact, change the binary assembly to use the unzipped base uimaj-distr bin artifact for base UIMA, add comment to src assembly indicating its no longer used (instead, the standard common Apache approach to building source-release.zip is used).  Move the RELEASE_NOTES and add the use of auto-generated jira issues report. Change the top level extra dir for the bin build from apache-uima to apache-uima-as to indicate it is the \"as\" version.  Move RELEASE_NOTES to top level.  Update to link with generated Jira Issues report."
