   "Add text selection auto scrolling. When editable text is in selection mode - entered by long-tapping on the text and choosing \"Select Text\" - the scroll behavior is changed. Touch+drag events change the selection. If you drag to the edge of the view and there is still more text available, the text will auto-scroll into view. This works in both horizontal and vertical directions.",
