   "Updated vSphere_SDK.pm::_get_resource_pool_view to check if vmprofile.resourcepath is not configured and only 1 resource pool was found on the host. If so, it skips the next step of looping through the resource pools. This makes it a bit more efficient.", 
   "Improved regex in initialize which determines whether the VM host's name is a full DNS hostname or a short name. Added check to make sure there's is a letter. This allows the VM hostname to be an IP address. Otherwise it was truncating the IP address."
