   "Summary: Yep, it's up and running. We now have full client/server support in all of C++ Java PHP and Python. Well, not quite... there's no PHP server, but honestly who wants one? Actually, if we do want one the framework will support writing is as a PHP file that can be served in apache like a web service (i.e. restserver.php would be thriftserver.php). But now that's rambling and nothing to do with this commit.",
