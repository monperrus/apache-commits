   "[Oops. Merging from httpd24threading back to trunk isn't going to work yet. The branches httpd24 and threading were both copied from trunk. The threading branch was then merged into httpd24threading, which was copied from httpd24 so all of the threading branch's changes will find their way back to trunk when httpd24threading is merged back, but the changes on httpd24 prior to httpd24threading being copied from it have been missed: there are no *revisions* on httpd24threading containing those changes, so httpd24 needs merging back to trunk first, and only then can we merge httpd24threading back to trunk...]",
