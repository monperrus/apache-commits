So to work correctly it still needs \"defaultFromEmailAddress\" (default =ofbiztest@example.com), \"mail.smtp.relay.host\" (default =localhost) and such to be set correctly... In other words the message \"A new password has been created and sent to you. Please check your Email.\" could even more misleading if people are not aware about setting SMTP"
