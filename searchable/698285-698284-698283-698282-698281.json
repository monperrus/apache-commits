   "Introduces notion of @Replicated entity. This feature allows to relax collocation constraint for quasi-stationary master data. A replicated entity is stored as identical copies across multiple slices. The ReplicationStrategy works similar to DistributionStrategy for replicated entity. The slice association cardinality has uniformly changed to array of slices from a single slice name both for replicated and non-replicated entity. The non-replicated entities can refer to replicated entities but not vice versa. The query operation (especially the ones with aggregate function) is aware of replicated data and queries only one of the slices to avoid duplication."
