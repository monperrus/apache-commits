   "Let's call the test listener the Orchestrator (it orchestrates the execution of the tests) and let's use Jetty as the server implementation. Size should not be important as I'm sure Jetty can be stripped to a few KB (the full jar is 500K). It has the advantage that we will be communicating between client and server sides using the well-known HTTP protocol."
