   "Upto v0.6, non-deterministic behavior leads to an error condition. Based on the February 2007 WD, such non-determinism should now be resolved based on document order and heirarchy of states within the state machine. Adding a suite of \"tie breaker\" tests that fail on v0.6, but need to pass on v0.7. Since none of that work is done yet, the tests are commented out."
