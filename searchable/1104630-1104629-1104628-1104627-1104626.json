   "SHIRO-293: implemented new 'Environment' and 'WebEnvironment' concepts, which are loaded in web apps via the new EnvironmentLoader and EnvironmentLoaderListener implementations.  The EnvironmentLoaderListener is now the preferred way to initialize Shiro in a standard web application (in web.xml), with the new org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.ServletFilter being the new preferred servlet filter in web.xml.  IniShiroFilter has been deprecated."
