   "Useful tweaks to the AJAX-related Stripes JavaScript. The client-side JavaScript now injects validation errors and messages that were generated server-side by an EventResolution, using the same prefixes and headers defined in CoreResources for \"normal\" JSP validation errors and messages. Generation of an EventResolution for AJAX methods that generate errors is automatic when the event method is annotated with @AjaxEvent. Practically speaking, what it means is this: to call an Stripes method via Ajax, just annotate the method with @AjaxEvent. Then, client-side scripts need only call the JavaScript function Stripes.submitFormEvent(). The rest is MAGIC."

   "Moved the admin-related JSPs to the templates directory. Added a new layout JSP, StaticLayout.jsp, that is used with template JSPs that do not need dynamic content, such as Install.jsp. Among other things, this allows admin-related JSPs to look more like ordinary pages, and use the same CSS."
