   "A Subversion working copy keeps track of *two* forks per file, much", 
   "like the way MacOS files have \"data\" forks and \"resource\" forks.  Each", 
   "file under revision control has its \"text\" and \"properties\" tracked", 
   "with different timestamps and different conflict (reject) files.  In", 
   "this vein, each file's status-line has two columns which describe the", 
   "file's state.",

   "--  glub.c      --> glub.c is completely up-to-date.", 
   "U-  foo.c       --> foo.c's textual component was updated.",

   "UC  baz.c       --> baz.c has had both components patched, but a", 
   "local property change is creating a conflict.", 
   "(In reality, this will only be the command-line client's \"verbose\"",
