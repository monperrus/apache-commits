   "WSCOMMONS-556: Changed the target version option of the Java compiler to 1.5. We depend on classes from the 1.5 API anyway, so we may as well produce byte code for that version. This may generate slightly more efficient code. Note that the source version is still 1.3 to avoid warnings about unchecked method calls (and to be able to restore Java 1.4 compatibility if the need arises)."
