   "Justification:", 
   "Prior to these changes reintegrate would not work if the merge source", 
   "had any subtree mergeinfo.  Since subtree mergeinfo is quite common,", 
   "this meant reintegrate was largely unuseable.  With these changes",

   "previously merged uniformly to the source for some contiguous revision", 
   "range starting at the revision the source was branched from the target.", 
   "These changes also improve the notoriously vague error message which", 
   "occurred when reintegrate was thwarted by subtree mergeinfo.", 
   "Notes:", 
   "This code reintroduces a use of svn_ra_get_mergeinfo with", 
   "include_descendants=TRUE, which can trigger the bug fixed by",

   "The change is fairly large. I've read all log messages and", 
   "most of the diffs, including the history of the branch", 
   "merged to trunk in r34091.", 
   "I understand what the change is supposed to be doing,",
