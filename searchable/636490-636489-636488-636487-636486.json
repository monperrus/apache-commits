   "Refactored the GadgetDataServlet to now use handlers. The sample container now uses this functionality to send requests to the server for dumping and setting state files. OpenSocial containers would use this mechanism for extending opensocial with additional data requests. In this way the main body of OpenSocial code won't have to be patched by real containers in order to be customized.", 
   "Still lots of todos to go, but the sample container is now nearly back where it was."
