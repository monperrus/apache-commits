   "(JS2-696 and JS2-694) For desktop only, changed values returned by createActionURL and createRenderURL to be regular urls (instead of 'javascript:doRender()/doAction()' statement). Added desktop /render pipeline, which is equivalent to /portlet pipeline except for the addition of the DesktopEncoderRedirectValveImpl (used by the /render pipeline (desktop-render-pipeline) to allow render requests that are not initiated via desktop javascript code to result in a page level navigation to the /desktop pipeline with the correct portlet rendering indicated in the original url)."
