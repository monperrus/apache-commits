   "Fix for http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-25644. For the bug, I added some logic in the addedHandler to only call validateTransformMatrix when layoutDirection changes.", 
   "Also, I refactored validateTransformMatrix() to make use of a backing variable for scaleX. This ensures that we have the correct sign on scaleX when the icon is resized when mirroring or going from mirrored to unmirrored. The backing variable is also updated during resizing because scaleX will change when the bitmap is resized.",
