   "[SUREFIRE-809] check child descriptions to figure out whether the class-level descriptions should be run, and cache the answers to speed up for next time (seems like it'll process the children twice in this approach). Also, load the categories as classes the way it used to be done before...just now, delegate the actual classloading to the matchers."

Started trying to integrate with the JUnit 47 provider, but the tests are still failing. Started implementing unit tests for the expression-based filter, but haven't completed this yet."
