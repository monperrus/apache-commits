   "The DTD did not validate, I had to remove two lines of header that belong in an XML document, not the DTD.  Also, there was an unbalanced parenthesis that I removed.  I added the output of the transform.  This was done with Trang, it is not hand-optimized.  orm.dtd has a lot of problems validating and I could not create a schema from it.  (Does it need one?)"
