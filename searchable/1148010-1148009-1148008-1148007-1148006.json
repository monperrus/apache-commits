   "Updated JQuery Mobile feature to use release 1.0b1 as per WOOKIE-220. Note that as JQM no longer generates \"back\" buttons this meant updating a few widgets to create appropriate \"home\" links. We no longer need to create a special patched version as back/forward buttons are no longer generated by JQM - however it is no up to widget developers to put in appropriate navigation links. Note also this version claims support for IE 7-9, which also fixes WOOKIE-183."
