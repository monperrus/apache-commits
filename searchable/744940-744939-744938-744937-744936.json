   "Applying Colins patch at: https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2115 basically:", 
   "Along with some other refactoring, these changes are an incremental step towards support a non blocking i/o environment conducive to single/low thread count broker.", 
   "Listing of changes:", 
   "1. Introduced org.apache.activemq.transport.DispatchableTransport and DispatchableTransportServer. These can be provided a dispatcher and operate in a non blocking fashion. They need to be backed by a FlowController to avoid overflow.", 
   "2. Changed PipeTransportFactory to operate in non blocking fashion by implementing above interfaces.", 
   "3. Added copy of org.apache.activemq.transport.nio package which are being refactored so they can be used with above interfaces.", 
   "4. Modified RemoteProducer, RemoteConsumer and BrokerConnection to extend RemoteConnection to take advantage of common network level changes described below.", 
   "5. Changed RemoteConnection to incorporate network WindowLimiter which assert flow control via protocol instead of relying on transport level flow control. Also updated RemoteConnection to take a Dispatcher. Deleted AbstractTestConnection.", 
   "6. Changed FlowController and PriorityFlowController not to implement IFlowSink. Instead introduced org.apache.activemq.SingleFlowRelay which wraps the FlowController and acts as a Sink/Source that does not queue messages that it is passing through, this now acts as the output sink for RemoteConnection.", 
   "7. Modified test.proto ProtocolBuffers definition to include new FlowControl message used to communicate space released by the flow controller in support of using protocol based flowcontrol instead of transport based flow control.", 
   "8. Introduced org.apache.activemq.wireformat.StatefulWireformat which allows stateful non blocking marshalling/unmarshalling. Changed ProtoWireFormatFactory.TestWireformat to implement this so that non blocking i/o can be achieved."
