   "Added Dependency Manager samples and benchmark modules.", 
   "(work in progress: still need to check license headers in files).", 
   "Having the samples in the DM workspace makes it easier to check if samples are working when DM core is modified.", 
   "And having the benchmark in the DM workspace makes it easier to make non regressions tests regarding performance.", 
   "Also, the samples are now part of the released artifacts, but only in the org.apache.felix.dependencymanager-r<n>-src.zip (source artifact).", 
   "(the samples binaries are not provided in the binary convenience (\"-bin\") artifact.", 
   "The benchmark is not part of the released artifacts because it requires java8 and that would complicate a bit the release process."
