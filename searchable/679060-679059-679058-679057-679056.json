   "QPID-1187 : The broker did not correctly handle subscriptions that would suspend due to exhaustion of bytes credit. The processQueue loop would spin, this fix marks the subscription inactive for that loop in processQueue so it will stop processing that subscription and ultimately the whole processQueue loop if required."

   "An option I've resisted for a while due to limited flexibility when used, but we have a lot of these common cases so this may be worth it; can now define CrUD services and not have to implement them for common cases; the create, update, and delete ExampleItem services now use this entity-auto implementation instead of explicit simple-methods; those are tested and are working, and other variations on create should too but I haven't tested them yet; this also includes various refactorings to expose nderlying tools in simple method code and make it reusable"
