   "[UIMA-2791] fix logic bug where a remote's binary capability overrode locally set xmi serialization (needed for current binary serialization when type systems are not identical).  Prepare for compressed binary serialization.  Fix one test where wait time was not long enough (on my little laptop).  Rename some constants that were the same as some class names, following better Java conventions.  Retain remote capabilities for serialization and type systems (will be needed for binary compressed serialization)."
