   "Cleaned up samples, moved composite files under src/main/resources. Cleaned up the bindingsTest integration tests, which are now working. Adjusted SCADefaultContainer and SCATestCase to pick up composite files under src/main/resources and allow the location of the system SCDL to be specified. Also temporarily moved the xmlbeans databinding out of the default profile as xbean.jar cannot be downloaded from Maven repos at the moment."
