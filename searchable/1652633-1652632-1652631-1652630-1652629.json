   "[OFBIZ-3433] eCommerce main store front error returned when attempt is made to \"Sign Up For Contact List\" - as reported by Ruth. Not a service level bug but a UI issue. Email is a required input parameter in \"signUpForContactList\" service. Sign up form does have a field for email but has no label which is confusing to user, neither it is displayed as a required field. Applied patch from the issue to fix UI. Thanks Ruth for reporting the issue. Applying changes from trunk r1652627."
