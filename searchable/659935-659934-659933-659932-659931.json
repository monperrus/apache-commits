   "Added support for xsl-fo and xml templates to the platform-specific screen widget element. Now it is possible to define the same screen that can be rendered with different renderers. An example of this is the SimpleDecorator that is now used to render simple PDF report (xsl-fo), xml export and printer friendly html output. You can test it in the Edit Example screen (and some other screens as well): the PDF and Printer Friendly links in that page both share the same screen definition. Misc fixes to the widget FO and XML renderers, for issues found while testing."

   "Added support for multiple container config paths at startup to make extension easier in the same manner as for features, and provided a facility to use more complex inheritance models for container configuration. This allows you to support situations such as a development environment that inherits from the production environment which in turn inherits from the default configuration."
