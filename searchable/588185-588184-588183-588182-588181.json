   "Added a shipGroupSeqId field to the OrderPaymentPreference to make it possible to tie them to a ship group on the order; this is like the orderItemSeqId field that has been around for a while to tie it to an item, and also fills the gap to be able to associate an order item and ship group combination to a payment preference; also added an orderPaymentPreferenceId to the OrderStatus entity so that this entity can also be used for payment preference status changes; related logic/UI changes will be coming along soon"
