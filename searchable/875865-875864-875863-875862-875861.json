   "On the issue-3334-dirs branch: Fix remaining issue #3334 problems.", 
   "The remaining problem on the issue #3334 branch can basically be summed up", 
   "as follows: If we have a locally deleted tree and an update or switch brings", 
   "down edits or deletions on, or within, the deleted tree, then we raise a", 
   "tree conflict on the deleted tree but don't update the text bases or", 
   "entries for paths within the locally deleted tree.  So the WC is at mixed", 
   "revisions post-update.  This means if the tree conflicts are resolved that", 
   "the WC cannot be committed because the mixed revisions cause out of date", 
   "errors.  Attempts to update the WC again result in the same tree conflicts.", 
   "This patch solves this problem by allowing the new text bases within the", 
   "deleted tree to be installed and the working revision of the entries to be", 
   "updated, but it still leaves the tree as scheduled for deletion.",
