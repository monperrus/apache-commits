   "Added run_slmgr_ckms() and run_slmgr_cpky() subs to Version_6.pm. They clear the KMS and product keys. These are called by deactivate(). Removed call to \"slmgr.vbs -rearm\". It was causing Sysprep to fail.", 
   "Added commands to Version_6.pm::run_sysprep() to delete the MSDTC.LOG file and reinstall msdtc.exe before running sysprep.exe. Sysprep occasionally fails because a MsDtc cleanup step fails. These steps prevent that from happening or remedy it if it already happened.", 
   "Fixed regex in get_license_status() to handle multiple-word status strings.", 
   "Uncommented line in Version_6.pm::activate() to call activate_mak(). It was commented for testing."
