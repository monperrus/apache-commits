   "More re-org and cleanup work in preparation for schema 1.1 particle restriction suppport: (1) Added support for ns/local pair, in addition to QName, to XSElementDeclHelper, for cases where a QName is not available. (2) Make XSGrammarBucket implement XSElementDeclHelper, to be used by particle restriction code. (3) Introduced groupSubsumption and typeSubsumption abstract methods in XSConstraints that are implemented by 10 and 11 derived classes. (4) Added a method to check restriction to XSCMValidator, and added implementation skeleton in the implementations classes. (5) Updated XS11AllCM to use different arrays to store elements and wildcards, to avoid constant casting. (6) Updated XSDFACM to use different arrays to store elements and wildcards. Also folded open content handling into the DFA."
