   "CTAKES-89 - During assembly copy the resources from src/main/resources to a resources directory which could then be added to the classpath during runtime scripts. exclude them in the jars for now since things like lucene can't read them from a jar anyway.  This is a non issue for eclipse ide development since maven automatically copies them to target and is in the classpath anyway."
