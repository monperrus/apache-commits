   "Fix for http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEEHIVE-1097 - modified NetUI FlowController execute() to handle exceptions from begin/end context on page flow ControlContainerContext. If we're not already handling an exception from executing the action, then we pass the exception to the handleException() method. Otherwise we will just log the exception from endContext. This commit includes a new test to check that we can handle the exception.",
