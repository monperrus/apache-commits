   "Mostly rename changes.  IVisualItem -> IVisualElement.  IVisualContainer -> IVisualElementContainer.  Also changed the APIs so that it's addElement, removeElement, etc.. instead of addItem, removeItem, etc...  Moreover, all of these APIs have been added to IVisualElementContainer (not just the read-only ones).  Now there's a common interface for all containers (even Halo's Container class implements it).  There's no more need to do:", 
   "if (x is Group || x is FxContainer)", 
   "Just use the IVisualElementContainer interface.", 
   "Some classes, like FxScroller (and perhaps DataGroup/FxDataContainer), will only implement the \"getter\" part of the API.  For now, if you call the mutation methods, we will throw an exception.  Perhaps later we'll add a separate interface for the read-only portion and the mutator interface will extend that one.", 
   "There might be a few more places in the code that need to be updated to use the new names for the methods.  I know Mustella needs cleaning up so it doesn't use getItem and uses getElement instead.  I've left the old APIs in there exactly for this purpose, so we can gradually move over to the new names (esp. QA).", 
   "At some point soon, we will remove the old methods as well as type them more strictly to only accept IVisualElements, for example addElement(element:IVisualElement).  Part of this work is dependent on updating the Flash Component Kit so that it implements IVisualElement (and perhaps IVisualElementContainer for containers).", 
   "Ran checkintests and all gumbo mustella tests.", 
   "QE Notes: Please update your tests to use addElement, removeElement, etc... along with the new IVisualElementContainer interface.  The old APIs (addItem, removeItem, etc...) will be removed soon.",

   "Adding IVisualContainer interface.  Group, FxContainer, and FxScroller implement this interface now.  Added owner and parent to IVisualItem.  GraphicElement and UIComponent implement this interface--work had to be done in GraphicElement to do this.  In doing so, elementHost is going to be renamed to parent.  For now, I added parent in GraphicElement and left elementHost in there; however, it is removed from IGraphicElement.  I\u2019ve removed all references to elementHost in our code; however, I think mustella needs to be updated as do mustella tests, so I\u2019m not going to remove elementHost until later.", 
   "Most of the changes here are name changes dealing with \"elementHost\" -> \"parent\".  If we decide that Gumbo components only support IVisualItems, we should clean up some of the code, but for now, I kept any assumptions that were in the original code (meaning we may be able to support DisplayObjects and old definitions of UIComponents/IUIComponents that aren\u2019t IVisualItems).", 
   "I ran checkin tests, Group mustella tests, DataGroup mustella tests, FxContainer mustella tests, graphic tags tests, and all effects Mustella tests.", 
   "QE Notes: We will need to update mustella and mustella tests to use elementHost rather than parent.  We can also update mustella to use IVisualContainer rather than what it's doing now.  However, let's wait on these changes for now.  I'll send out an email when we're ready to make these changes and remove elementHost from GraphicElement.",
