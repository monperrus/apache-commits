   "Resolution of the model removal/addition issue raised by Fernando Padilla (refer users@avalon).  The issue concerned the addition of a child appliance following a prior removal.  The problem was related to a reference held by the parent block in its deployment graph.  The solution covered by this commit invokes the retraction of the block level methods in favour of explicit reactive modification of the block composition structure using events propergated by the meta model."
