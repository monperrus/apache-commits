   "QPID-829 Remove 0.10 specific URL. The code path is now selected based on broker response. We first try the highest protocol version and update the handler if the broker replies with a different protocol version. NOTE that we need to update the current java broker and 0.8 client for handling protocol headers. This should happen with the M2.1 merge. For the moment we only support an in VM 0.8 broker. Moreover, we'll need to migrate to a 0.10 vs 99.0 protocol version."
