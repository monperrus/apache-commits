   "move the URI canonification around some more.  get_uri_list() now just puts together canonfied parsed and html uri lists, html canonification happens in extract_metadata, extract_metadata only runs once now and is called multiple times whenever canonfied html uris are needed.  modified around t/uri_html.t to not need a temp file, just run through get_uri_list() internally and not call a full SA, and avoid the whole debug output reading bit."
