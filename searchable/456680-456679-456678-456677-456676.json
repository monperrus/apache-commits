   "refactored feedback message handling to be independent (using pull models) of the flow of execution of a page again. This makes it easier to use, and results in less spagethi code.", 
   "Introduced IFeedbackBoundary that is a tagging interface to implement message hierarchy blocks. Currently it is implemented by Page and Form. IFeedback now has one method that can be used by implementing classes to set (override) the actual component from where messages are collected. Form uses this to set the collection point when a IFeedback instance is provided. The add/remove methods of IFeedback are removed.", 
   "Made both FeedbackPanel and FormComponentFeedbackBorder non-final, so users can provide their own markup. Also, FeedbackMessagesModel that is used by FeedbackPanel is public, so that it can be used for custom implementations without having to know too much about the internals of message collecting."
