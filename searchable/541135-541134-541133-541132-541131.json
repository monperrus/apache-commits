   "provide a fix for a formatting issue that was occuring when using the s:radio and s:checkboxlist struts2 tags.  both of those tags render their outputted items without providing a way to add a line break between each item, so they were always rendered in a horizontal list.", 
   "the fix here is to create a custom struts2 theme for roller which overrides the way those 2 tags work and add a <br/> at the end of each printed item.  this custom theme can be used only on the specific uses of that tag which need them, so the default functionality is still available."
