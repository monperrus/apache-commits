   "1) Removes a bunch of Win32 junk from http_main.c into service.c, so that", 
   "http_main.c nearly goes back to the state it was in last week.", 
   "2) Hooks in termination logic that is often not called when apache is", 
   "exit()ed with atexit() calls.  This, incidently, prepares us to pause", 
   "while exiting Apache from a Win32 console window.", 
   "3) Explicitly names the hidden Win32 notification message monitor by the", 
   "name of the service.  This will allow taskbar applets to walk the list", 
   "of windows to determine which Apache services are running under Win9x.",
