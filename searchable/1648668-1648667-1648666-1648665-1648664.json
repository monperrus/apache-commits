   "A slightly modified patch from Divesh Dutta for \"The <delete> action in <entity-engine-xml> definitions throw an error in tests\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-5906", 
   "Data loading for xml data was working fine when <delete>,<create>, <create-update> tag were used . But these tags were not working when data was loaded at the time of running J-unit tests. So after researched that how data loading was working fine for simple data load. So I used the same way than in EntityDataLoader.java to parse the XML file.",
