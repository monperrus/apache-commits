   "Biggest feature is full implemented of a ZooKeeper startup/shutdown policy on the fly.  The servers are chosen on the fly and everyone is made aware of them.  Cleanup is automatic as well upon job success.  Features were added to allow the junit tests to be submitted to a real Hadoop configuration by setting VM system parameters.  Moved the TestSuperStepOnlyVertex class to examples.  Added new master cleanup (to get rid of znodes and files).  Changed from mapred.task.id to mapred.task.partition since its cleaner."
