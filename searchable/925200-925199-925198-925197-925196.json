   "New singleton-per-wiki class WikiPathResolver, part of the org.apache.content package, caches UUIDs and WikiPaths. It also constructs canonical WikiPaths that based on WikiPage ATTR_TITLE attributes from the JCR. This ensures consistent naming. These too are cached. The caching is primitive and *should* use EHcache, but doesn't yet. It *probably* makes sense to move logic from WikiEngine.getFinalPageName (and related code) here, but that wasn't a goal for this checkin."
