   "For the generated code for an array setter where the element is the head of a substitution group the insertNewXXX() setter in the impl class was being generated incorrectly in that it did not pass in the QNameSet defining the members of the substitution group. This meant if you inserted into an array of such things and there were substituted elements already present they would be ignored in deciding what position to insert. This submission fixes that.",
