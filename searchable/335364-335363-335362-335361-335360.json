   "namespaceURIs are kept in the same Vector, m_prefixMappings.  The entries are stored as pairs of vector elements.  The even elements contain the prefix and the odd elements contain the URI.  In two routines, getPrefix and endElement, the appropriate prefix or URI was being located in the Vector using an indexOf.  However, in this case where the prefix and the URI were the same, the routine was looking for the URI but finding the prefix instead of the URI.  It tried tried to back up one to get the prefix and underflowed the Vector size."
