   "Updated QueryServlet to pass an instance of Path (an immutable sequence of Strings) to the handler methods instead of a string. This saves the handler methods the effort of parsing the string and also avoids unnecessarily parsing it multiple times (e.g. in validate(), createSerializer(), and in the actual method handler). Also made the handler methods protected since calling them without first preparing the thread local member variables would result in an invalid state, and made a trivial argument name change to Sequence.Tree.Path."
