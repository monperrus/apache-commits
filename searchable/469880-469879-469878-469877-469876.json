   "Refactored the \"receivedInventoryProduct\" service from \"group\" service to minilang.", 
   "In this way the error handling is easier to maintain and implement and the success response messages are finally implemented (when one or more items are received, now the quantity received, the product id and inventory item id are shown).", 
   "Also the service now handles correctly both serialized and non serialized inventory.",
