   "Added a boolean flag to control the ignore behaviour of the MSG_TAG_TO property of the IN message. If using 2 endpoints - mail poller and mail sender - to just forward messages to another address you most likely ran into the issue, that the mail was always forwarded to the sender account again.", 
   "This behaviour is the result of the marshaling. The poller marshaling will put all mail properties into specific headers. If you now just forward this message to a mail sender, this sender will do a decision what TO address to use. The TO address in the message has always highest priority, so this will be used then. To disable this behaviour, you can now just set the flag ignoreTOProperty to true and then this property will be wiped out on message receiving."
