   "In-gadget improvements to initialization of parentRelayUrl aka. gadgets.rpc.getRelayUrl('..')", 
   "* Only performed for a gadget (non-top-level page).", 
   "* Uses gadgets.util.getUrlParameters() to get parent param rather than implementing a second parser.", 
   "* Moved transport.setup('..', ...) into config init method rather than immediately-executed gadgets.rpc.init(). This ensures that any transport (or other code that runs before gadgets.config.init(...), which ultimately computes parentRelayUrl) has accurate access to the parent URL.", 
   "- This fixes RMR-based browsers' container-to-gadget communication.", 
   "Tested w/ \"correct\" setAuthToken behavior (gadgets.rpc.setAuthToken('gadget', ...) after gadget has been created on:", 
   "* FF2, FF3, Opera 9, Safari 3, Safari 4, Chrome 2 (OSX); Chrome 1, IE6, IE7, IE8 (Win)", 
   "Also, improved rpc test framework a bit:", 
   "* Gadget rendered w/ &libs=rpc to doubly ensure that new rpc code gets picked up in-gadget.", 
   "* Gadget spits out its parent relay URL for immediate display."
