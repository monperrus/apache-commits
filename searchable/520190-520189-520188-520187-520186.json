   "DERBY-47 (cleanup): Cleanup patch which does the following:", 
   "1 - Changes Predicate.isRelationalOpPredicate() so that it just calls", 
   "the already existing method \"isRelationalOperator()\" on the left", 
   "operand of the predicate's AND node.  This ultimately comes down", 
   "to a simple check for a null variable in BinaryRelationalOperatorNode,", 
   "which is cheaper than the old check.", 
   "2 - Adds a new method, \"isInListProbeNode()\", to ValueNode. The default", 
   "case returns \"false\", while BinaryRelationalOperatorNode returns true", 
   "if it has a source IN-list associated with it.", 
   "Also adds a corresponding method called \"isInListProbePredicate()\"", 
   "to Predicate.java. This method allows for simple (and relatively", 
   "cheap) checking of a predicate to see if it is an IN-list probe", 
   "predicate.", 
   "3 - Modifies Predicate.getSourceInList() to return the underlying", 
   "InListOperatorNode for probe predicates AND for \"normal\"", 
   "IN-list predicates (i.e. an IN-list that could not be", 
   "transformed into a \"probe predicate\" because it contains", 
   "one or more non-parameter, non-constant values)", 
   "This then allowed for some cleanup of other related code in", 
   "PredicateList.java.", 
   "Also adds a second version of getSourceInList() that takes a", 
   "boolean argument; if true, then it will only return the source", 
   "IN list for a predicate *if* that predicate is an IN-list", 
   "probe predicate.", 
   "4 - Changes PredicateList.generateInListValues() to account for the", 
   "fact that it only ever gets called when we know that there is", 
   "a probe predicate in the list.", 
   "5 - Shortens a couple of lines in FromBaseTable that were added with", 
   "earlier patches but were longer than 80 chars. Also rewrites", 
   "one Sanity check in that class to avoid construction of strings", 
   "when no error occurs (per recent discussions on derby-dev)."
