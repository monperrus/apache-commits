And in PasteOperation, the scrapToPaste() method has been removed in favor of a textScrap property  (but I'm questioning whether this change is OK since I think it makes a copy of the TextScrap).",

   "- Fix layout looping in SDK-22186.  Actually a TLF bug but easy to work around.  The compositionWidth/compositionHeight setters should check for NaN, since they are legal values, when decided if the value has changed.  Since they weren't they were damaging the text flow even though there were no changes.",
