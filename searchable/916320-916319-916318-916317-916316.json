   "QPID-2421 : Augmented Async Performance test to take new 'preFill' value, that puts <n> messages onto the broker destination before the test begins.", 
   "When running on a non-TX'd producer session the use of the new 'delayBeforeConsume' will pause the client for <n> ms before the test starts, giving the producer session time to flush.", 
   "This new functionality can be explored with the new 'testWithPreFill' script.", 
   "The 'numConsumer' parameter was augmented to allow a 0 value which disables all the consumers. This can be seen with the 'fillBroker' script.", 
   "To complement that a new 'consumeOnly' boolean was added to disable sending messages. This can be seen with the 'drainBroker' scripts.", 
   "All scripts are located in java/perftests/etc/scripts", 
   "Merged from 0.5.x-dev commit r916304"
