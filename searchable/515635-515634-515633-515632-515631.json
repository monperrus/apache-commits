   "Change BodyRuleBaseExtractor plugin to use perl's built-in regexp parser, 'perl -Mre=debug'.  This renders the code a lot more reliable, and it can now parse a wider range of regexps than before.   Improve Rule2XSBody diagnostics, in particular around which compiled regexp DFA is being loaded, and reasons why it discards some compiled rules; Remove some superfluous escaping from sa-compile.raw; and add several new test cases for BodyRuleBaseExtractor"
