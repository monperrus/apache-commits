   "Applied patch from Awdesh covering issues reported on Mailing list for failing of test cases.", 
   "Now everything is working fine when we ran \"java -Xmx1024M -jar ofbiz.jar -test -component='accounting'\".", 
   "Following points are covered in this patch:", 
   "1) Created one more PaymentGroup record that is 9001 (Because same PaymentGroup record is being used in two different test cases so prepared individual record for each of them) .", 
   "2) Removed record \"<PaymentGroupMember paymentGroupId=\"9000\" paymentId=\"8002\" fromDate=\"2009-07-11 12:28:45.315\"/>\" because no Fin Account Trans record is present corresponding to this and as per business process when we create deposit slip or check run one trans record is also created which is associated with payment group record ,also changed value in test case accordingly .", 
   "Thanks Awdesh for the contribution."
