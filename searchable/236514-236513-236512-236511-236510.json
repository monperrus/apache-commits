   "Now using Commons Logging as the logging framework (or rather Facade). It replaces our previous LogService. This was a move we wanted to do but it was hastened by the fact that Commons HttpClient now requires Commons Logging, so I thought it was time to make the switch. As a benefit, Cactus can now use any of the following logging frameworks with no modification to Cactus itself: Log4J, JDK 1.4 logging, LogKit, No logging, SimpleLog (provided in Commons Logging). The Cactus Sample build file configures Cactus to use Log4J (but you can really use any of the other logging frameworks)."
