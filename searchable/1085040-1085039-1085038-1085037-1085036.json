   "changing one of the assertions error key. the earlier key was causing confusion between xs:assert failures and those of xs:assertion. though this key is not perfect still (it is still common for both these cases), and we could probably try to refactor the assertions error messages devising new appropriate keys to distinguish between failure cases of xs:assert and xs:assertion. for now, this change looks better to me than the earlier codebase for assertions error key. i'll try to do the proposed changes as above, sometime later."
