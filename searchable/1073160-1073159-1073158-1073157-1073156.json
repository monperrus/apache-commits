   "Reverted incompatible changes not detected by CLIRR.", 
   "The changes were detected by running the former 2.1 test (which is a realistic approximation of what existing user code may look like) against version 2.2 of the library itself. This showed that user code that did use DerivativeException (but also FunctionEvaluationException) which have recently been switched back to checked did not compile anymore (the revert did disable the attempt for a smooth transition).", 
   "Hence this fix declares again all these exception throughout the API.",
