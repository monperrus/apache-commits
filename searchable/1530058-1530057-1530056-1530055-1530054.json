   "Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55633 for NIO.", 
   "The Comet code that ensured that multiple threads didn't process the same socket when the selector indicated that a socket was ready for read and write pre-dated r1001698 where syncs where added to the SocketProcessor to achieve the same aim for Servlet 3.0 asyncs processing.", 
   "The Comet code was re-used to handle upgraded connections.", 
   "The upgrade code did not handle the case where a socket was registered for read and write but only a write event occurred. In this case the read registration was lost. This is the root cause of the lack of responsiveness observed in bug 55633.", 
   "With the changes in r1001698, a simpler solution can be used for both", 
   "Comet and HTTP upgrade. The new approach unregisters the socket operations the selector has reported ready for and then triggers a read and/or write as appropriate. For Comet the syncs will ensure that read and write aren't processed in parallel. For HTTP upgrade such parallel processing is permitted."
