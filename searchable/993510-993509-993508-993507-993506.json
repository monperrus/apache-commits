   "Introduces a very simple mean to set a dependent Id field when using a Name field as a lookup (the fields must have the same prefix, eg: partyName, partyId).", 
   "It uses the description (Id) shown with the Name. Hence the Lookup screen must be set in order to show a description in the autocomplete part.", 
   "It seems this is not always easy notably when you need to show at least 2 parts for the Name (eg Person).", 
   "At least it easy to set and it works well for simples case for now (eg PartyGroup)", 
   "I did not find another way since Ajax.Autocompleter can't update another field.", 
   "The alternative would be navigation to the next hidden field, at least it would avoid the mandatory Id/Name pair.", 
   "But it's more difficult to demonstrate in Example component"
