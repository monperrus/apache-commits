   "Refactored JDBC code towards a more flexible instanciation mechanism. It is now possible to pull any type of object from the database using custom Mapping and Persister implementations. It is also possible to filter objects loaded from the database - for instance, discarding expired password entries. Finally, Realms can through exceptions during authentications, allowing SPI code to be more specific about the reason of a failed authentication."
