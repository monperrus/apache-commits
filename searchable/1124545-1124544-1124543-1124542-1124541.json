   "-ObjectTypesResource provides create, update and delete services about ObjectTypes. These requests were reflected to MappingEngine and related Processor (the ObjectTypeProcessor) handles the request.",

This caused lots of changes in other classes such as changing parameter type or removing a method completely.", 
   "-PUT and DELETE services were added NotifyResource. Also, \"considerBridges\" and \"adapterMode\" parameters are added to services. So, this resource can bu used by any repository with our without bridge definitions.", 
   "-Added new property to CMSAdapterVocabulary to keep the reference of declaring ObjectType. And it is used operations related with properties in OntologyResourceHelper."
