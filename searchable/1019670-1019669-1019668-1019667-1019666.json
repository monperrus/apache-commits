   "fixing bug whereby the cglibobjectfactory and javassistobjectfactory ('s enhancers) were caching an old PersistenceSession rather than picking up from NakedObjectsContext, the net effect being that the DnD viewer didn't repaint after invoking an action.  Also fixed prob in DnD viewer not clearing the ViewUpdateNotifier once read (think due to a change in semantics of getChangedObjects() method made a while back).  Also FixtureBuilderAbstract was incorrectly closing the PersistenceSession, causing a NPE when debug enabled.  Also removed some warnings by genericizing one or two classes"
