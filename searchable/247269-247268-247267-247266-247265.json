   "Problem:", 
   "The class passed to Java2WSDL may contain methods that", 
   "throw exceptions that are not allowed in an SEI.", 
   "The operations in the SEI must throw RemoteException", 
   "plus application specific exceptions.  General exceptions", 
   "(like java.lang.Exception or java.lang.NullPointerException)", 
   "are not allowed in the SEI.", 
   "Solution:", 
   "Changed the ServiceDesc code that creates the FaultDesc objects.", 
   "A FaultDesc is not created for exceptions in the 'java' or 'javax'", 
   "packages.  (Simple Change)", 
   "I recently added an addrNoImplSEI testcase which tests proper", 
   "processing if the server-side impl does not implement the SEI.", 
   "(This test is meant to somewhat simulate a server-side EJB).", 
   "I enhanced this testcase to roundtrip Java2WSDL and WSDL2Java.", 
   "I added some general purpose throw clauses to the Impl class to", 
   "make sure tht Java2WSDL properly ignored the exceptions when", 
   "generating the SEI.",
