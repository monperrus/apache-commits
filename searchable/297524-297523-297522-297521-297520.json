   "Fix for POST in in-process.",

   "one tomcat thread sending/receiving messages with apache, and one apache", 
   "thread ) in a 1-thread model, with no context switch.",

   "send() will marshal the response back into the same buffer, and next", 
   "receive() will just read it.",

   "minimizing the most expensive operation in jni - moving data between java", 
   "heap and C ( we have a single java buffer that is pinned ). Of course,", 
   "the rest of the code must deal with that - and make sure the buffer is", 
   "not used for something else.",

   "be called imediately after send(), so things are not too bad.",

   "it may be worth removing it for cleaner code ). In JNI mode, there", 
   "is no such thing.", 
   "The fix is to check if the receive() is the result of a sent(), and", 
   "return an empty message otherwise."
