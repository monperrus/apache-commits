   "Fix focus issues introduced by TLF build 545.  When setText() or setTextFlow() is called when we have focus, make sure there is a text flow with composer in place, the controller has focus and there is an insertion point of 0,0 so typing can continue without a mouse click or a mouse hover.  The caller can set a different insertion point by calling selectRange() after calling setText() or setTextFlow().",

   "This is currently a new interface in Player 10.1, although it is likely to change before 10.1 ships. Flex 4.0 compiles against Player 10.0, which does not have this interface in its playerglobal.swc. So Flex 4.0 now has a copy of this player interface in spark.swc to compile against. When running on 10.0, it is ignored. When running on 10.1, there will be a copy in the SWF or RSL and another in the Player; they will be identical, but the Player one should \"win\" because it is loaded first.", 
   "This interface is currently used to support three different things:", 
   "1. Exposing text selections to accessibility clients via the GetSelection() method of the COM interface ISimpleTextSelection.", 
   "2. Helping to implement inline IME.", 
   "3. Exposing FTE/TLF text to headless players used by web crawlers.", 
   "The part we're trying to get working first is #1. Unfortunately, ITextSupport currently requires selection-range properties called selectionAnchorIndex and selectionActiveIndex, while RichEditableText has named these selectionAnchorPosition and selectionActivePosition, following their names in TLF. The names will hopefully change before 10.1 ships so that RichEditableText does not have both pairs.", 
   "This interface also may get split up so that components that want to support web crawling do not also have to look like they support editable text.",
