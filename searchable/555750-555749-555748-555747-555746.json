   "This looks like a big change but it's really not.  Previously we had an abstract class Client with a single concrete implementation called CommonsClient.", 
   "In the code, this would always look like:", 
   "Abdera abdera = new Abdera();", 
   "Client client = new CommonsClient(abdera);", 
   "Given that we currently only support the Commons HttpClient, having this distinction really does not make any sense.  This change combines the two classes", 
   "into a single AbderaClient class.", 
   "And while I know this will drive Garrett crazy, there is one additional change bundled in this set.  It is now possible to set a RequestOption so that a RequestException", 
   "is thrown when 4xx and 5xx is returned by the server.  This is disabled by default and allows client developers the ability to use explicit error handling.  I'll try", 
   "to make this the last time I bundle multiple changes into a single commit."
