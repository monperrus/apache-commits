   "Renamed @ParseableEntry to @Parseable, and optionally delegate to newly created Parser interface.  Analogously, added a new @Encodeable annotation which can delegate to an EncoderDecoder interface.  Also removed @FacetFactoryClass and @FacetFactoryName, gone with simpler Class and String arrays (no need after all to wrap these up); defined new @Aggregated annotation and @Value annotation, but not yet written the facets, facet factories or tests for them.  The @Value will be reusing the work done on Parser and EncoderDecoder, however ... coming together!"
