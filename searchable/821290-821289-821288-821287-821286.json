   "Dissected current Border implementation into two java classes: BaseBorder and Border. Border still works as before and not a single test case was modified. BaseBorder, the super class for Border, has all magic removed but instead creates a standard component hierarchy. No more transparent resolving and ambiguities with where to find the child component, the body and the associated markup. It comes at a (small) price. All children required to be added to the body must be added via getBodyContainer().add(child) or short addToBody(child). Border.add() will add children which markup is found in the associated markup file <wicket:border>...</wicket:border>",
