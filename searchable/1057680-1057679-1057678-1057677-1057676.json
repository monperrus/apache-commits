   "AVRO-727. This patchs several missing accessor and mutator methods for Avro",

   "more interesting cases:", 
   "- You can create the appropriate avro_datum_t instance for an", 
   "arbitrary schema with the new avro_datum_from_schema() function.", 
   "For records, this includes creating a datum instance for each of the", 
   "record's fields.  Arrays and maps are initially created empty, while", 
   "a union is created with none of its branches initially selected.", 
   "This prevents the function from going into an endless loop for", 
   "recursive schemas.",

   "branch is already active, this has no result.  Otherwise, a new", 
   "avro_datum_t is created for the new branch.", 
   "- Map values can now be accessed by index as well as by key.  The", 
   "index of a map entry is based on the order that it was added to the",

   "- Enum values can be retrieved or set either by integer value or by", 
   "symbol name.", 
   "A couple of the new functions need access to the schema of a datum in",

   "parameter.  A better solution might be to include a reference to a", 
   "schema object in each avro_datum_t instance."
