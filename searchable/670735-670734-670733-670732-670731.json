   "Removed old funny hex encode and decode routines from StringUtil, as they produced the same results as the commons library; found and fixed the real problem with the old entity engine encryption so that encrypted fields, including credit card numbers, couldn't be decrypted with the new code and it was the hashed key names no longer matched so the wrong DES key was used, ie a different one from the original key used to encrypt even if the original key was still in there; now it tries both, which is necessary because for systems updated before this went in there will be entries using the old DES key and some using the new DES key, so we can't just try one or the other; this should fix problems with credit cards and other encrypted value decryption after updating to fix the password hashing problem from a few weeks ago"
