   "- Removed several ***Adm requests from webtools application. Used view-last/save-last-view pattern instead to have the same portlet handling requests usable from everywhere.", 
   "- Replaced AddPortlet request and view-map with addPortlet. This seems to be the standard we use.", 
   "- Portlet attributes are now edited using a dedicated screen. This is how it works in the new PortalPage widget. I used the same system in the actual PortalPage system also because it was too complicated to handle it in two different way. In any case it should not hurt.", 
   "- Removed a debug string in the PortalPageColumn renderer."
