   "AFP GOCA: Work-around for InfoPrint's AFP implementation (AFP Viewer 3.5.4.1, AFP Workbench 2.5.4.1) which seems to lose the character set state over Graphics Data (GAD) boundaries. Setting the SegFlag on the SFI header did not help. Instead, the character set is re-set before each Character String order.", 
   "As part of the fix, some additional flags were implemented, but now not used. They might be useful in the future."
