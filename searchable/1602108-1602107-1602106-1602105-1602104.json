This commit also reverts that, and (hopefully) does the job properly this time.", 
   "Normally, ap_get_server_version is exported from an httpd library and AP_DECLARE in third-party code such as ours means to dllimport it from there. However, if we're building against httpd-2.3+ then httpd no longer provides that symbol, but we have our own definition in modperl_apache_compat.c instead. In this case we need AP_DECLARE to mean dllexport (like it does when building the httpd core) so that our compat version gets exported from mod_perl.so/lib (but we still need to dllimport it when building Apache2/ServerUtil/ServerUtil.dll, of course).", 
   "This is effected by #defining AP_DECLARE_EXPORT in modperl_apache_compat.c (before modperl_apache_compat.h gets included, to cover the declaration too). This will affect all such declarations in that file (which is correct, being the whole point of the file) without affecting any other code, which continues to dllimport as usual (either from some httpd library, or from mod_perl.so/lib, whatever happens to provide the definition).",

   "........", 
   "Add the path to mod_perl.so to the PATH when running the test suite on Windows", 
   "Httpd.exe is able to find mod_perl.so because the test httpd.conf contains a LoadModule line with the fully qualified path to mod_perl.so in it. However, before httpd.exe is started the test framework must create that httpd.conf file. In the case of mod_perl it uses perl.exe and goes into Apache/TestConfigPerl.pm's run_apache_test_configure(), which runs APACHE_TEST_CONFIGURE() in various modules in t/response/TestApache (e.g. subprocess.pm). Those modules all use Apache2::Const, but Apache2/Const/Const.dll and ModPerl/Const/Const.dll now depend on mod_perl.so for the 'perl_module' symbol. Therefore, perl.exe must be able to find mod_perl.so when running the tests, and this is the easiest way to achieve that.", 
   "There is no problem with Apache2::Const and ModPerl::Const depending on mod_perl.so because they are normally only used within a mod_perl application, which will (obviously) have mod_perl.so loaded already. (It is only the APR::* modules which we are at pains (elsewhere) to avoid having a dependency on mod_perl.so because they are of use outside of mod_perl applications.)",
