   "DERBY-4241: Improve transition from read-only to writable Clob representation", 
   "When a store stream Clob is going to be modified, it will be written out to the temporary area of Derby and represented as a TemporaryClob.", 
   "The transfer of the data is done in a sub-optimal manner for two reasons;", 
   "o for transfer of the complete Clob, the copy method operates on the byte level and we're not able to save the character length.", 
   "o for transfer of parts of the Clob (i.e. truncation), we have to first decode the UTF-8 encoding to find the byte count and then transfer the same bytes.", 
   "This fix addresses both issues by improving the length caching and by adding", 
   "a method that counts the charactes \"on-the-fly\" while copying raw bytes.",
