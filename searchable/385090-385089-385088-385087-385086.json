   "Removed wrapping from MimeMessageWrapper: now it is a simple MimeMessage extension (thanks to latest javamail providing much more protected methods than earlier releases)", 
   "Updated a few file/stream handling objects to use SharedFileInputStream so that javamail will not load the full message in memory when cloning the message. (Related to JAMES-134)", 
   "Added a bunch of tests to check consistency of the various MimeMessage implementation/constructors.", 
   "(Sorry, no \"streaming support\" for db repositories in this commit: still working on it)"
