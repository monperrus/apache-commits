   "Added a temporary spark.components.RichEditableTest2 class. This is a re-implementation of spark.components.RichEditableText using TLF's new InputManager class. Once the new class works as well as the old one, we'll replace the old one with the new one.", 
   "Using InputManager means that this component doesn't have to pay for interactivity (scrolling, selection, editing, or hyperlinks) until it actually uses these features, such as when you give it focus. The main goal of the re-implementation is to speed up the case of a complex form with lots of TextInputs. However, if the non-interactive case is fast enough, we may be able to eliminate the current RichText implementation.",
