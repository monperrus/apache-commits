   "constructor of AxisConfig and no checking was made to  verify the success", 
   "of the method. Now this method is called from initialize_module() method of", 
   "Axis.cpp. In this way failure can be detected. Further, default configuration", 
   "values are assigned in the AxisConfig constructor.", 
   "AxisTrace.cpp and AxisTrace.h are modified so that now it acts as a good logger.", 
   "The logger can have three severity levels defined in a enumeration of GDefine.h.", 
   "When AxisTraceX is called it has to pass the severity level as the last parameter."
