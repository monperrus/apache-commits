   "Fixed how includes are processed by calling to the new XmlUtils.moveSubTree method which takes the include element as a parameter.", 
   "Also modified how imports are removed. Now schema (not wsdl) imports simply lose their schemaLocation so that the namespace is still present in the schema so that the wsdl will validate.", 
   "Added checks to make sure that when processing wsdls that have xsd:import elements that have no schemaLocation that those elements are ignored."
