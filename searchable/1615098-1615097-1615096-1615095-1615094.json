   "Update for GeoAPI changes: replaced MD_CharacterSet code list by direct use of java.nio.charset.Charset.", 
   "The reason for this change is that ISO 19115:2003 defined its own code list for character sets, while", 
   "ISO 19115:2014 still define an MD_CharacterSetCode but the new definition does not enumerate any element", 
   "and instead refer to IANA registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml).", 
   "Consequently there is no need anymore to handle the ISO 19115:2003 custom names in the Apache SIS API.", 
   "The java.nio.charset.Charset class use IANA names, so it is suitable for this new situation."
