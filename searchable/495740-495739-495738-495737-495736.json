   "A work around type fix for Jira issue ROL-1294 for fixing inconsistent scheduling for Roller's periodic tasks.  This fix changes the scheduling of RollerTask objects such that instead of scheduling them directly on the Timer we use a wrapping executor class which when triggered launches the real task on it's own thread running in the background.  This prevents one task from hogging the schedulers time and delaying other tasks from running."
