   "Addressed most of the FIXMEs in TLFTextField. The main changes are:", 
   "It now starts listening for the 'render' event only when it becomes invalid, and stops listening when it has been validated. Previously, it listened for the 'render' event whenever it was onstage. This change should improve performance.", 
   "It now uses a static TextField to initialize the defaultTextFormat rather than creating a TextFormat object and filling it out.", 
   "The logic to avoid getting or setting the scrollRect property unless it non-null is now in overrides of scrollRect.", 
   "The value of condenseWhite used to process the htmlText is now the value when htmlText is set. Previously, it was the value at render time, which could be different.", 
   "The validateNow() method now does no work if neither the TextLines nor the Graphics are invalid.", 
   "A background (at alpha = 0 if background == false) is always drawn now, to provide the correct mouse bounds.", 
   "It now invalidates in response to INLINE_GRAPHIC_STATUS_CHANGE events from the TextFlow, to handle asynchronous <img>s.",
