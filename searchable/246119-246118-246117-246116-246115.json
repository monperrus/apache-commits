   "Added WSDL2Java and Java2WSDL support for the new JSR 101 Simple Type mapping.", 
   "1) The soapenc simple types now map to java lang classes.", 
   "For example:", 
   "soapenc:int <---> java.lang.Integer", 
   "xsd:int     <---> int", 
   "In addition, a use of a simple xsd type with \"nillable=true\"", 
   "cause the type to map to the java lang classes.", 
   "For example:", 
   "xsd:int + nillable=true   --> java.lang.Integer", 
   "When the WSDL2Java emitter encounters \"nillable=true\" it", 
   "stores a compatible qname in the symbol table.  So", 
   "xsd:int + nillable=true results in soapenc:int being used.", 
   "2) The new mapping exposed the fact that Holder classes are missing", 
   "for the java.lang classes.  We are awaiting official word from JAX-RPC,", 
   "for the names of these classes.  For now:", 
   "java.lang.Boolean -> javax.xml.rpc.holders.BooleanClassHolder.java",

   "3) New mapping exposed some problems in JavaTestCaseWriter,",
