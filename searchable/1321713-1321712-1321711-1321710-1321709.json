   "It's tricky to handle \"print #1234\" now, because we now use asc's parser to parse the expression (\"#1234\"), and that is not a legal ActionScript expression.  To hack around this, we now detect \"#\" followed by one or more digits, but only at the very beginning of the expression.  If we see that, we replace it with \"$obj(1234)\".  $obj() is a new pseudofunction handled by the FDB, which evaluates to the object with id 1234.",
