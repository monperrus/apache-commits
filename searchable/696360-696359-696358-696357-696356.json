   "TRINIDAD-1217 - in portals stylesheet generated in the producer even when skin matches and suppress is true", 
   "* Add an isPortletMode method to the StyleContext and StyleContextImpl which tells if the current stylesheet is being rendered in the PortletMode or not. This allows us to encode our stylesheet entries and stylesheet cache files with a special key saying they were rendered in stylesheet mode.", 
   "* Enhance FileSystemStyleCache to keep track of whether a particular skin was generated in a portlet or not. Current criteria is based off compression, direction, browser and version, platform, locale, and accessibility profile. I would add portlet mode to this criteria so that a simple.desktop skin generate by a portlet is cached differently then a simple.desktop skin generated by a servlet.", 
   "* For saved stylesheets, any stylesheets which are cached on the server would be saved with an \"_prtl\" prefix. This ensures that servlet generated stylesheets do not interfere with portlet generated ones.", 
   "* I'm also going to add some performance enhancements to the stylesheet cache because, well, I can. :)"
