   "Final checkin for RC1.  Changed initModel in Component to search the whole parent", 
   "hierarchy for CompoundModels.  Added logic that allows Components to know if they", 
   "are the root model or a child sharing the parent's compound model.  This allowed", 
   "me to remove getRootModelObject() and incorporate the logic necessary to get the", 
   "right model directly into getModelObject(), which now always works.  It also made", 
   "it possible to make replication of objects using compound models vastly more", 
   "efficient since Components that inherit models are now detected and nulled out in", 
   "detachModel().  When the Component is deserialized, the model will be null and it", 
   "will be initialied via initModel() when needed as it originally was.  Made changes", 
   "to Images and ImageButtons so that they search for models differently (as a last", 
   "resort, actually).  This means they can be used with CompoundModels like any other", 
   "Component, although that use-case should be rare."
