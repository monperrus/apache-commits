   "[UIMA-1756] updates to the website include 2 new pages not yet linked from the top: maven-design.html which describes how we use Maven for building, and dev-docbook - which is a start at describing how to write docbook style documentation so it can be built with our build tooling.  Also, the svn page has been updated to say to use m2eclipse, and mentions the new top-level \"build\" directory in svn.  Some of the instructions (e.g. building from the command line) are updated to new aggregate project names (so they apply to the branch until it's reintegrated...)"
