   "QPID-1806 : Ensure Flow to disk location is deleted when the queue is closed", 
   "Note: As our queues do not stop processing on the close() call it is possible that the backing store may not beable to be deleted. In this case all that will occur is that it will log the failure to disk so an operations team can manually clean it up. When we improve the Queueing model for AMQP 1-0 we can address this behaviour."
