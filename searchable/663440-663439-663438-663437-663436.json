Improve the Map-Reduce shuffle/merge by cutting down buffer-copies; changed intermediate sort/merge to use the new IFile format rather than SequenceFiles and compression of map-outputs is now implemented by compressing the entire file rather than SequenceFile compression. Shuffle also has been changed to use a simple byte-buffer manager rather than the InMemoryFileSystem.",
