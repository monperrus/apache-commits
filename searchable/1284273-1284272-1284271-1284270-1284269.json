   "Fixed issues with popups and effects. We were incorrectly grabbing the location of the popup before it was actually on the stage - AnimateTransform should not capture values of unparented objects (it should instead lazily grab location values from the object as the animation begins). Also, the alpha value of the popup was being clobbered by the value in the owning anchor. Finally, the auto-fading logic which temporarily adds in a disappearing object was not accounting for the popup parent of SystemManager.",

   "Fix/workaround for use of suspendBackgroundProcessing on Flex 4 effects. The new effects depend on layout validation running to update the properties of the target objects, but this flag specifically suppresses layout validation. The 'fix' is to disable setting this flag for the new effects. A longer-term fix is in the works, but in the meantime, it will at least be possible for the new effects to work if this flag has been set.",

   "Fixes a bug with the Fade effect where it would sometimes RTE when adding in an item that was in the fade-to state. This happened when there were other objects in the same parent container that were not in both states, causing the retained index value of the faded object to be beyond the allowable range of the container. In this situation, we simply add the faded object at the end of the parent's children instead of at a specific place in the middle.",
