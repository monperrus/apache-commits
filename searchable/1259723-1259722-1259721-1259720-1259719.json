   "Update for implementing ILayoutDirectionElement in BitmapAsset and SpriteAsset. Instead of trying to handle transforming the assets directly, we leverage AdvancedLayoutFeatures to update the transform matrix of the assets. The main difference between the asset implementations and other ones is that width/height and scaleX/Y are tied to each other. The setters of each of those properties will set the backing value of their respective property. Another change is that we use the existence of layoutFeatures to keep track of whether the asset needs to de-mirror instead of using the mirror variable.",

I added an exclude for the layoutDirection property in UIComponent. This allows code hinting for the layoutDirection style in the CSS style declaration. It also removes the layoutDirection property from the ASDoc. Code hinting still works for the layoutDirection attribute on a UIComponent subclass MXML tag. This attribute gets set to the property, not the style.",
