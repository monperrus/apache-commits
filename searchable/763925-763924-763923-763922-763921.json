   "Lots of generics improvements. [JSPWIKI-473] Fixed bug that was causing role checks using custom Authorizers to fail. AuthenticationManager was not calling Authorizer.isInRole(WikiSession, Principal), as it should have. In addition to fixing the bug, we also now include a special test case to verify that custom Authorizers work properly. Thanks to Steve Dahl for reporting this issue. (This was forward-ported from 2.8.)"
