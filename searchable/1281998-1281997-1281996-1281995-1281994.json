   "There are a few cleanups here in Button and InteractionStateDetector when in touch interactionMode. I looked at all the places where we set hovered and mouseCaptured and made sure it did the appropriate thing while we're faking the down state if someone does a quick-tap. This included, adding code to deal with getting a rollOut while we're faking the down state.", 
   "In addition, this fixes SDK-28868 . Basically the issue is that we get an extra event (rollOut) on a touch device. However, because on rollOut, we were setting hovered = false with transitions off, this would cause a state change (to the same state, but it would do it without transitions).", 
   "I discussed this with NJ, and we decided to only not play transitions when a scroll starts (not when the down state is cancelled by rolling out).",
