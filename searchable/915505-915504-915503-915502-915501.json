   "Implemented W3C WARP spec (see WOOKIE-85). This automatically adds access request beans for widgets based on the content of the <access> element in config.xml. These are granted by default if the widget is deployed to the local deploy folder, but otherwise are not granted. There is currently however no UI for administrators to grant or revoke these access requests. Note that this update includes a database schema change to add a new table for AccessRequest."
