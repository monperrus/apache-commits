   "Made array literals strongly typed; the code will attempt to find a common class for all elements of an array literal. Thus a ['foo', 'bar'] will create a String[ ] . If all elements are primitives of the same type, the returned array will be of that primitive type; [1, 2] will create an int[ ]. If all elements are Number (but of different classes), a Number[ ] will be returned. If all attempts fail, an  Object[ ] is returned."
