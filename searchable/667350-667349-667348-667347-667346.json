   "Removed TestHttpServletRequest, TestHttpServletResponse, TestHttpSession, TestFilterChain, TestFilterConfig, TestServletContext in favor of the much-superior Stripes mock objects. TestEngine was retrofitted with the Stripes mocks and all unit tests were also changed. In particular, take note of the TestEngine.newHttpRequest() factory method, which should be used to create test request objects."
