   "because of changes to CLEREZZA-531 one must now move the fetching of relations that can be found in remote graphs into the graph sent to the rendering engine. This was discussed as part of CLEREZZA-447 which is why the $[WebProxy] functionality had been added, allowing a very minimal graph to be returned by JSR311 code which could be followed by linked data code. Fixed some html in the person in a box view, but can't get the table to take up the whole width of the page. How does one make a page compact?"
