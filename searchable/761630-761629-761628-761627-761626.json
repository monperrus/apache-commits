   "- AckRequest's now added as piggybacks to application msgs (this is needed as implementations don't have to piggyback acks and therefore could only respond to ackRequest msgs.)", 
   "- We can ignore piggybacked ack requests as Sandesha piggyback acks at every opportunity", 
   "- Offered EP's can't be set to none so have set to use AcksTo as the offered EP if one hasn't been set", 
   "- Updated so that we poll for terminateSeqResponse", 
   "- Updated so that we offer for 1.1 as well as 1.0.  This fixes an interop issue with WCF."
