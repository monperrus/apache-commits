   "schema 1.1 commit: committing a new psychopath xpath2 engine jar file. this has few enhancements for XPath 2.0 value comparison operators. previously an expression like 1 eq '1' produced a true result. this now produces a dynamic error XPTY0004 as per the XPath 2.0 spec. the implementation of operators lt and gt were also enhanced similarly. I observed that operators le, ge and ne worked fine previously. I discovered this error, when I was trying to do xpath2 deep-equal(..) on xs:string and xs:integer sequences (a related bug in deep-equal is also now solved, due to these enhancements).", 
   "PS: the psychopath engine changes were also committed on the Eclipse repository."
