For a TERRITORY_BASED collation french database, differences between pre-composed accents such as \"\\u00C0\" (A-grave) and combining accents such as \"A\\u0300\" (A, combining-grave) should match for = and like. But they do not match for UCS_BASIC. We insert both into a table and search based on equal and like."
