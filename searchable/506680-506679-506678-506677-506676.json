   "Set the default to use the JDK's classes; the alternative implementation doesn't work atm, and I need to be able to make build with 1.3 that work for the production system I'm working on (and I'm sure I'm not the only one). When fixes come in, I'll be happy to test it by setting the application to use it, but I really want the JDK implementations to be the default until we are sure our stuff works properly and preferably are covered by sufficiently by unit tests"
