   "Check in patch for ADFFACES-176:  UIXCollection token cache - Intenal Oracle Bugfix Needs to be backported to Trinidad.  The problem in the original code was that clearing the token cache on every encode was too aggressive, especially in the face of PPR requests that don't update the table (and therefore leave all the IDs in the content as they were).  So, instead, clear the token cache only on requests where we're delivering a RowChangeEvent.  This itself isn't perfect, but it's a big improvement."
