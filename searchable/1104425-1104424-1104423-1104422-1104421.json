   "A patch from Martin Kreidenweis \"NullPointerException in GenericDelegator during testMode rollback\" https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-4284", 
   "Test mode rollback doesn't work right in GenericDelegator for calls to removeByPrimary() key and removeByValue() when the row to be deleted didn't exist in the first place. It creates a TestOperation with a null value and subsequently fails to create that during rollback.", 
   "First, the TestOperation shouldn't be created at all. Second, if null is passed to GenericDelegator.create() it tries to handle this, but fails with a NullPointerException."
