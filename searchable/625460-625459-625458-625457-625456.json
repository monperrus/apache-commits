   "GroupManager changes from an interface to a concrete, final class. Group storage is now handled by a separate GroupDatabase interface. The default implmentation is XMLGroupDatabase. In addition, Group becomes a concrete final class; DefaultGroup and DefaultGroupManager disappear. Group gets a new method groupPrincipal() that returns the equivalent GroupPrincipal. Many new unit tests created for all of these changes."
