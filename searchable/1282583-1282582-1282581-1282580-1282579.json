   "Fixed a problem with scrollbar stepping animations over very large ranges. The easing function for the step animation meant that a very long-duration animation (which is what a very large range would result in) would have a long time easing in, which meant that it would be incredibly slow to start and be essentially useless. The fix was to cap easing to 500 ms max (or 10% or the total duration for shorter durations).",
