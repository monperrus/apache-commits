   "WARNING: Full plugin rewrite! Version 3.0 of the Cactus plugin now relies on the newest Cactus/Ant integration which has completely changed since version 2.0 (and 2.1-SNAPSHOT, which by the way has never been released, and never will). Thanks to the new Cactus/Ant, some features have also been added. The plugin now uses the new <cactifywar> and <cactus> Ant tasks (see http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/integration/ant/index.html for more details)."

Amazing....",
