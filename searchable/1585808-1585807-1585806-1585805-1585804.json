   "In order to write a simplistic non-Java client (PHP in our case), where we don't want to push the region locating code to the client side, we can let the Region Server do it for us.", 
   "The client can pick up an Region Server in the regionservers tier, and get the location for any row in the table. The client is also able to request the server to disregard any previous cached location if it needs to.",
