   "Fix bugs and regressions around List selection and drag and drop", 
   "Problems:", 
   "1. DND caused regression in ctrl+click deselection because it prevented listeners for mouse up to be attached unless dragEnabled was true (SDK-24210).", 
   "2. ListBase check for commitSelection() relies on internal variables that are updated *before* calling itemSelected(). If the item selection at that point causes layout manager to validate properties before returning, the List will enter into a second commitSelection() while the first is mid-way through below on the stack. Net result is the selection is undone giving the illusion the item is not selected (SDK-24132, SDK-24105, SDK-24130).", 
   "Fixes:", 
   "1. Add listeners for mouse up when either DND is enabled, or there's pending selection on mouse up.", 
   "2. ListBase, commitSelection: commit internal variables state before calling itemSelected to prevent entering a second time into commitSelection.",

   "Before, it only took one parameter, the renderer.  Now it takes 3.", 
   "The reason for this change is to make the code a little cleaner in terms of the separation between DataGroup and List.  Now DataGroup won\u2019t do any work if the mx_internal _rendererUpdateDelegate is set.  If it is set (to a List for instance), then _rendererUpdateDelegate.updateRenderer(renderer, itemIndex, data) will be called.  This makes the updateRenderer() pass more clear because it\u2019s all done in the rendererUpdateDelegate (rather than splitting it in DataGroup and ListBase).  It also makes it easier to get the ordering of properties correctly as we want the \u201cdata\u201d property to be the last set property as part of the \u201citem renderer contract\u201d.", 
   "As part of this change, DataGroup is the default _rendererUpdateDelegate, and because of this it now implements IItemRendererOwner.  The only other method on IItemRendererOwner besides updateRenderer() is itemToLabel().  DataGroup already had a private itemToLabel() method, so I\u2019m just making it public.", 
   "Also, I'm making label and itemIndex bindable to the \"dataChange\" event now.",
