   "Followup checkin to collapsing the path segments into Path: The data getter used to have to accommodate the case where the data property wasn't set but the segments property was. In that case, the data getter had to reconstruct the data value by parsing the segments to create the data string. Now we don't have to do that since the segments property is unsettable. _data is always just null (default) or whatever the current data value is.",

   "With this check-in, we now collapse Path segment classes (PathSegment, MoveSegment, LineSegment, CloseSegment, CubicBezierSegment, QuadraticBezierSegment) as internal, private classes in Path. Paths will now be wholly dependent on the compact syntax for expressing Path data. Previously, users could write:", 
   "<Path>", 
   "<segments>", 
   "<MoveSegment x=\"0\" y=\"0\" />", 
   "<LineSegment x=\"100\" y=\"100\" />", 
   "<CloseSegment />", 
   "</segments>", 
   "</Path>", 
   "Now, this syntax is illegal since the Path segment classes are not publicly accessible. Users have to write in the compact syntax as the value of the Path's data property, like so:", 
   "<Path data=\"M 0 0 L 100 100 Z\" />", 
   "Additional changes include:", 
   "1. Path.segments property removed. In its place, there is private variable (segments) which holds the path data parsed into the correct segment objects.", 
   "2. Path.segmentChanged() removed \u2013 Segments do not need to notify the parent path when their properties have changed since they are now not individually accessible.", 
   "3. PathSegment.segmentHost property removed \u2013 Segments do not need a pointer back to the parent Path since now they are now not individually accessible.", 
   "4. PathSegment.notifySegmentChanged() removed \u2013 Segments do not need to notify the parent Path they have changed since they are now not individually accessible.", 
   "5. PathSegment.dispatchSegmentChanged() removed \u2013 Path segments do not need to dispatch propertyChange events since they are now not individually accessible. As part of this, I have removed the [Bindable] and \t[Inspectable] metadata from all PathSegment properties.", 
   "6. PathSegment no longer extends EventDispatcher, instead it extends Object.", 
   "7. All of the PathSegment and derivative classes no longer have getters/setters for their properties (like x, y, etc) since these properties are now not dispatching property change events.", 
   "8. A variety of checkintests/sparkTest project files have been updated to use the compact syntax as they are drawn/transitioned between state changes. Refer to sparkTest/AddItemsTest.mxml and RemoveItemsTest.mxml for examples on how to use states and transitions to transform Paths through the data they are bound to (as opposed to modifying individual segments).", 
   "This is as per the ARB decision listed here: http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Verbose+Path+Syntax", 
   "QA: Yes - Joan ran a cyclone and updated all tests", 
   "Doc: Yes - Changes above need to be reflected in documentation",
