   "Fix for SM-563 - its not pretty but it does work - basically the maven-project is not maintaining the order of the dependencies on the model - therefore we re-parse the model to get it back to its original state and thus back in the correct order.  This issue with Maven has been fixed and should be available in 2.0.5 (commented the code to note this)."
