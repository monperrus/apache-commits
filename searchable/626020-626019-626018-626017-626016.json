   "This release adds a significant new package for modeling workflow operations (com.ecyrd.jspwiki.workflow). This package allows arbitrary combinations of \"steps\" to be modeled, with support for unlimited branching and support for human intervention. The core class is the Workflow class. Workflows are composed of Steps, which can be Tasks (which run uninterrupted) and Decisions (which require input from named Principals -- users, roles or groups). This initial checkin is well-tested and solid code, but the API should not be considered stable... yet. There are NO user-interface classes as yet. Additional front-end JSPs that provide a UI will follow in the coming weeks."
