   "When array properties didn't have a sub-tag of <fx:Array>, the compiler injected an Array node and re-traversed (which creates new child node instances).  However, if the child nodes had id attributes, those were already registered with their old node instances so you got a duplicate id error.  Add \"equals\" test that checks line number so we don't think it is a duplicate if we see that a node was registered with the same line number."
