   "Major refactoring of the integration tests, most of the test code is now common for both Stomp and Openwire.  Only those tests that test features or functionality specific to either protocol are broken out into their own test cases.  Some additional tests have been added as well along with cleanups to tests that were poorly implemented or had timing issues."
