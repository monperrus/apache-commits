   "OFBIZ-733: Create invoices for drop ship orders", 
   "- Adding logic to createInvoicesFromShipments service to deal with creating both purchase invoices for drop shipment orders and sales invoices for the sales order linked to drop shipment orders - a sales invoice is created if the createSalesInvoicesForDropShipments parameter is true.", 
   "- Adding createSalesInvoiceFromDropShipment service to wrap call to createInvoicesFromShipments, passing the createSalesInvoicesForDropShipments parameter.", 
   "- Adding SECAs on updateShipment to generate a purchase invoice when a drop shipment is shipped and a sales invoice when a drop shipment is received", 
   "- Adding quickDropShipOrder service, linked from orderview page, to create a drop shipment and set the shipment status to shipped and then received, in order to trigger the SECAs for drop shipment invoice generation.", 
   "- Fixed flaw in createInvoiceForOrder service - now pro-rating OrderAdjustments based on OrderItem quantity from the database instead of the passed-in OrderItem, in case the OrderItem quantity has been replaced upstream."
