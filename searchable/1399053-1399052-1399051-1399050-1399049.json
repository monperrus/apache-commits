   "Set start level of managed bundles to 1.", 
   "The start level of all managed bundles is now explicitly set to 1. A managed bundle is a bundle installed by the subsystems implementation. This includes both content and dependencies. Setting the start level to 1 avoids start failures when the framework's initial bundle start level is set to a higher value than the start level under which a subsystem is being started. For example, a management agent starting at level 2 might call FrameworkStartLevel.setInitialBundleStartLevel(5) then proceed to install and start a subsystem. If the bundles installed as part of the subsystem installation inherited the initial level of 5, the subsystem would fail to start since all bundles (except for the region context bundle) are started transiently.", 
   "A new test was also added."
