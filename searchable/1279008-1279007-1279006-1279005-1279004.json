   "On a dp REFRESH or RESET, if there is a caret position, it will stick to the data item if it is still in the collection and ensureCellIsVisible() will be called to keep the caret in view.  For a REFRESH, if the caret is not in the collection, the existing scroll position is maintained.  For a RESET, if the caret is not in the collection, reset the caret and scroll back up to vsp=0.  Fix a loop in ensureCellIsVisible() - a column which is not visible will never be visible.",
