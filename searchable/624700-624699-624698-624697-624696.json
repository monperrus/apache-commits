   "Turned on JDBC autocommit for the db-setup/teardown operations. This allows certain SQL blocks to gracefully succeed even when there are stupid errors. So if we drop a table or user that doesn't exist, it won't b0rk our test scripts. Also tweaked the McKoi targets so they don't fire when other JDBC databases are used. Rookie mistake, really."
