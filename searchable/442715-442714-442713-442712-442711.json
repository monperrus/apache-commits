   "OK, lets set up a test app for the SCXML dialog2 bits so we can see them in action. Per my understanding of the dev list discussion, lets begin with straight copy of the legacy dialog2 test app. The idea being this will get up to speed ASAP, and we should have some dialogs that are outwardly the same anyway. We can worry about the redundancy in the sandbox source tree later if we have to. Once its reasonably functional, I'll add this module to the sandbox pom."
