   "Some cleanup on examples:", 
   "* removed obsolete examples (queue-/topic-sender/receiver)", 
   "* removed the need to include headers with boost dependencies", 
   "* moved the argument handling in darin and spout closer to that of python (and update docs to reflect that)", 
   "* changed to ship a manually constructed makefile for messaging examples (generated one doesn't work and maintaining that seems like more work with little benefit)"
