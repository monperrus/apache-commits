   "OPENEJB-1296: Allow @DependsOn usage by all session bean types", 
   "In EJB 3.1 the @DependsOn annotation was added to deal with ordering of beans annotated with the @Startup which causes the bean to be instantiated eagerly at application start rather than lazily on first request.  Only @Singleton beans are allowed to use the @Startup annotation, however the new @Stateless minimum pool size functionality also causes instances to be created at startup presenting the same ordering issue that an @Singleton+@Startup might have.", 
   "To eliminate any ordering issues brought on by any eagerly started beans, the @DependsOn annotation can now be used on any session bean type."
